Yes, hypervigilance is indeed another symptom of PTSD.

It sounds like you experienced a high level of stress and concern during your time in Iraq, particularly because of the constant mortar attacks, which were unpredictable and hard to detect. Initially, you were hypervigilant, but over time, you realized that you couldn't maintain that state and had to find a way to function despite the ongoing threat. It seems like you were ultimately trying to survive the situation rather than attempting to fully control or master it. Can you elaborate on how this experience has affected you since leaving Iraq?
It's understandable that you experienced heightened anxiety and stress during deployment, as it's a difficult and dangerous situation.

Take your time to think about it and add any new insights to the list. This will help us understand your situation better and work on overcoming your fears.
Thank you for sharing these situations that cause you anxiety. It's helpful to assign a fear scale to different situations as it can help us identify strategies for coping with them. For example, we could practice exposure therapy to gradually face your fears, starting with less anxiety-provoking situations like driving on less busy roads or waiting in shorter lines at the store. How do you feel when you're in these less fearful situations? It might be helpful for us to understand your reactions and feelings at those times.
It sounds like your anxiety is significantly affecting your ability to enjoy activities you used to love, like going to the theater. It's good that you're able to identify your anxiety levels for different situations.

Thank you for sharing your anxiety triggers. It's great that you're able to identify the situations that cause you discomfort. It might be helpful to address these fears one step at a time, starting with the low-level ones like calling your dad in casual situations.

However, everyone's situation is unique. Have you evaluated those factors for yourself?
It's great to hear that you have been active in your community and have found an area where you excel in management skills.

Just remember that everyone in the group is there for similar reasons, and it's a safe space to share and learn from each other.

It's understandable that focusing on deeper aspects of life can feel challenging. It might help if you try to reflect on your values and what truly brings you happiness and fulfillment. Practice mindfulness to stay in the present moment and gradually shift your focus from the superficial to more meaningful areas. Does this issue affect your relationships or daily activities?
It's interesting that you've noticed this difference in self-analysis and privilege among people. Do you think individuals who occupy marginalized positions tend to engage in self-analysis more than those who don't, because they have to think more about their identity and how they navigate the world? It's normal for people to analyze themselves and their surroundings, and it can be a sign of growth and increased self-awareness.
I don't think it's off topic at all. It seems like you're able to stand in both places - recognizing your privilege and also embracing your queer, trans, and person of color identities that are pushed to the margins and put you at risk. It's interesting to think about how you've managed to do that. What or who has inspired you in this journey? How have the values of your loved ones and friends influenced you as someone who can stand in both privilege and marginalization?

It's important to question things, as it can help us gain a better understanding of ourselves, our values, and the world around us.

It's great that you're contemplating the right time to come out and considering the impact it may have on others. Instead of thinking about coming out in a hostile environment, you could think about deciding who you want to invite into your world, creating a more welcoming space for you. Assess your readiness, and think about whether you're holding yourself to unrealistic standards of courage, and remember that you don't have to prove anything to anyone. Focus on what feels right for you, and be gentle with yourself throughout the process.
That's an important consideration, and it shows your empathy for others in different situations. While advocating for your cause, make it clear that you understand that everyone's circumstances are different, and not everyone can be as visible or outspoken as you.

You can also share resources and support for those who may want to become more involved but are facing barriers.

It sounds like you're acknowledging that there's more for you to learn and understand, which is a great quality to have. Your ability to consider how your actions might affect others is quite humble and generous. Is your dad's generosity something that has influenced you in this regard?
It's wonderful to see that you've inherited your father's compassionate nature and are applying it to help others in need. It's important to support others while maintaining your own well-being, so don't hesitate to reach out for help or advice if you ever feel overwhelmed by the responsibility.

How do you envision your ideal self, free from these social constructs and expectations?
It's great to hear that you want to be more open and true to yourself, especially around your family. Remember, people might need time to adjust to change.

It might be a step towards strengthening the bond you share with your family.
It's understandable that coming out to your family can be a challenging and emotional process. Your friend's advice about putting the ball in their court suggests that you can only do so much to initiate the conversation and create understanding, the rest is up to your family's acceptance and support. It might be helpful to think about how you would like to approach this conversation and what kind of support you have in place for yourself during this time. Remember, it's important to prioritize your own well-being in this process. Are there any specific concerns or fears you have in regard to coming out to your family?
It's great that you appreciate the value of storytelling and its importance in carrying your history forward.

Knowing this information might help you to align your goals with her values and ultimately strengthen your relationship.
It seems like finding common ground with your mom and communicating the value of your actions is important to you. One thing you might want to consider is approaching the conversation on your terms, focusing on meaning and intentionality. This might help your mom understand where you're coming from. Do you have any specific strategies in mind for bridging this communication gap?
It's great that you find hope in hearing others' stories, and it shows your willingness to connect with your mom. I understand that it's difficult when your personalities and views might clash. Instead of trying to change each other, try to find a common interest or activity that you both could enjoy. This way, you can focus on building your relationship and understanding each other better, potentially discovering similarities you didn't realize were there.
It sounds like you and your mom are struggling with communication, and both of you may have some unresolved similarities that might be affecting your conversations. I would suggest, when talking with your mom, try to focus on actively listening to what she says and understand her perspective.

Additionally, you could also express your concerns in a calm manner to her and see if that leads to a more productive conversation.

Is there a specific concern you have that makes it difficult for you to express your thoughts to her?
It's important to remember that people may have good intentions when they make those comments, but they might not realize the impact their words have on you. Try to focus on the positive aspects of their intentions, such as their admiration for your strength. However, if you feel the need, you can also gently educate them about the implications of their words and how it makes you feel. Remember, you're in charge of your narrative and can choose how to respond to these comments.
It's admirable that you're staying true to yourself despite the challenges you're facing with being ostracized and losing your support system.

This might have been difficult for you, especially during emotional times like your dad's funeral. It's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings, even if your family might not have been supportive in doing so. Are there any moments where this focus on image has significantly impacted your life?
It's interesting that you feel so strongly about other people's opinions. Do you often find yourself focusing too much on what others think instead of what you feel is true for yourself? Remember, it's important to listen to our own needs and desires rather than seeking validation and approval from others. This will allow you to build a stronger inner sense of self and create a more meaningful life experience.
It sounds like she may be holding back her true self due to societal pressures and expectations surrounding power and gender. As a counsellor, I would encourage her to explore these feelings and her own identity, helping her recognize her strengths and what makes her unique. We could also talk about ways to navigate these systems while staying true to herself. By the way, what specific systems do you think she's being affected by?
Thank you for sharing about your family member. It's interesting to learn about her background, especially considering the challenges she may have faced growing up during that time and without English as her first language. If you have any specific concerns relating to her language development or any other aspect, please feel free to ask.

Recognizing your strengths and accomplishments can give you guidance and confidence as you navigate this transition.
It's important to understand that communication can be challenging, especially between parents and children.

Perhaps revisiting counseling together, with a focus on improving communication, could be beneficial for both of you.
It sounds like there's a communication breakdown between you and your mom. You might consider finding someone who could help facilitate a conversation with her to clarify your values and reasons behind your transition. By sharing this information with her, your relationship might improve, and she'll have the opportunity to better understand your journey.

As a counsellor, I appreciate your effort to develop your understanding of the concept. To answer your question, when talking about the translator metaphor, it refers to the idea of interpreting and translating different languages in a conversation.

What aspects of the AA meetings worked well for you, if any, or what kind of support would you prefer in your journey towards sobriety?
It's understandable that you may not agree with how some people in AA choose to present their recovery. It's important to recognize that everyone's journey is unique and what works for one person may not work for another. However, if you're finding it difficult to relate to others in AA, maybe you could explore other support groups or resources that align more closely with your values and beliefs.
It's true that some methods can work better for certain individuals depending on their beliefs and values. In the case you mentioned, it seems that these methods resonate more with religious people, possibly because their faith plays a significant role in their lives. However, we can explore other approaches that may be more appropriate for you, focusing on your preferences and needs.

It's great that you've found some ways to cope, like shutting off the computer and talking to your friends and mom. Between now and our next meeting, try to do more of those things. As for sharing your feelings with your mom, if she has been helpful so far, perhaps consider opening up to her more about your situation. What are your thoughts on discussing this issue with your mom?
It's great that you're open to discussing your situation with your friend. Open communication is key to maintaining strong relationships. Do you find it easy to share personal information with your friend, and do you believe she'll be supportive of your situation?
It's great that you're open to helping your mom understand the internet better. I suggest that we arrange a meeting with your mom in the next week, where you can show her what's going on online. In the meantime, continue talking to your friends and focusing on your future goals, as it seems to be a positive coping mechanism for you.
You're a strong, courageous, and capable person, and it's completely valid to want to start seeing achievement and feeling good about yourself again. It's important to know that you're probably not the only person going through this right now. Have you considered reaching out to your teachers and discussing your situation?
It's good to hear that you don't believe in revenge, as it's important to maintain a strong moral compass. I understand dealing with people who pick on you can be challenging. Have you considered helping others who might be going through similar situations? Offering support and guidance to them might make you feel more empowered and help you find purpose and strength.
It's great to hear that you've found the strength to step away from the issue and that you're feeling better now. Helping others in a similar situation can be beneficial for both you and the person you're supporting. Take this week to think about how you might make that work, and let's meet again to discuss your thoughts and possible ways to make a positive impact on others facing similar challenges.
It seems like you're trying to avoid negative attention and not seeking positive attention anymore. Can you tell me more about any incidents or thoughts that might have led to this change in your behavior?
It sounds like you experience fluctuations in your sense of power, and that feeling powerless can lead to anger. Can you tell me more about the situations in which you feel this way?
It's important to recognize that you have people who are on your side, like your friends, mom, and Ms. Jones. Try focusing on the positive attention and support that they give you instead. Regaining your sense of power may involve spending more time with those who make you feel empowered. Can you think of any activities you could engage in with them that would help boost your confidence and strength?
It's natural to have concerns about your friends as you all move forward in your lives. It might be helpful to discuss your feelings with them and maintain open communication. Would you like to explore some ways to manage these emotions or maintain these relationships after graduation?
Thank you for sharing your feelings. It's great that you can recognize the difference in your body language and emotions when you're happy. Now, let's work together to find ways to cope with your current feelings of worry and negativity. I have some papers here that could help explore these emotions and possibly find solutions. Are you willing to try something new today and see if it makes a difference?
Thank you for choosing the color pink to represent a feeling you have at home. Can you please elaborate on why you chose this color and what specific feeling it represents to you when you think about being at home?
It's great to hear that you associate home with excitement and positive feelings, like the color pink. It seems home provides you with a sense of comfort and happiness. The trips you take with your family also seem to be an important aspect of your life that brings you joy. Exploring more of these happy experiences can help you maintain a positive outlook on life. Do you have any upcoming trips or plans with your family that you're excited about?
I understand that these comments can be very hurtful and make you feel inadequate. It's important to remember that your worth is not defined by what others say about you. You mentioned that your friends think you're pretty neat and cool. Focus on the positive relationships in your life and consider talking to your friends or family about how you're feeling. What steps can you take to protect yourself from these hurtful comments online?
It sounds like you have a diverse range of interests and skills, which is great! It's important to be well-rounded and involved in various activities, as it can contribute to a fulfilling life. However, feeling inadequate sometimes is normal - remember to focus on your strengths and accomplishments instead of comparing yourself to others. Is there a specific reason why you feel inadequate recently?
It sounds like you're struggling with the shift from positive to negative attention due to the changes in your life. It seems like the negative attention has caused you to stop engaging in activities that brought you positive attention before. Why do you think you stopped participating in those activities and what can you do to shift the focus back to your achievements and strengths?
It's amazing that you have the strength to shut the computer and walk away from the situation you didn't want to engage with. I'm curious to know, were there any specific thought process or strategies you used to avoid letting it affect your day? Remember, it's important to be aware of such strategies so you can use them effectively in the future.
It's amazing that you were able to not let that situation get to you and move on. Surrounding yourself with supportive friends is definitely helpful in coping with tough times. Can you recall any other instances where you've employed strategies or activities that have positively impacted your well-being?
It's good that you are thinking about the future and expecting things to get better. This positive attitude can help you through difficult times. What other coping strategies have you used in the past, or new ones that you might consider trying now?
As a counsellor, I would say it's a great idea to focus on your priorities, as it might help you move forward. I don't have any other feelings to share online right now, but it's important to address negative feelings as they arise. Exploring the meaning of words on cards could be an interesting exercise to understand your thoughts and emotions better. Let's start with the first word and discuss what it means to you.
I believe revenge does not align well with my personal values, as I don't feel good about hurting others. I agree that it takes courage and strength not to retaliate, and I think that the emotion it most closely aligns with is 'hurt'.
It's natural to feel sad when experiencing a sense of inadequacy or lack of worth, as these emotions are closely related. Not feeling valued can lead to unhappiness and sadness. It might be helpful to explore the reasons behind these feelings of inadequacy. Have there been any specific events or situations that triggered these emotions in you?
It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of dread and sadness at home. It's challenging to cope when these emotions are impacting your daily life. I understand that it's difficult for you to maintain those comfortable feelings. Can you think of any specific triggers or situations that tend to cause your dread and sadness to reemerge?
It sounds like you're facing some challenges on social media, especially on Facebook, and it's affecting your mental well-being. You're taking a strong step by choosing not to engage with it sometimes, in order to protect yourself from any negativity. Tell me more about how you handle the situation when you hear these things in the hallways. It's important to find healthy ways to cope with these stressors both online and offline.
It's great to hear that you have found a way to cope with some of your problems by distancing yourself from them. However, it's also important to address and understand any other feelings you might have at home. Can you please share more details about those feelings so we can work through them together?
It's admirable that you haven't retaliated and you're managing your emotions. You seem to have strong values and support from your mom, which is great. It's natural to feel angry at times, but it's important to find healthy outlets for those feelings. What other strategies have you tried to cope with the situation?
It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and confused with what's happening at school, and it's great that talking to your mom has been somewhat helpful. It's important to express these emotions instead of holding them in. You mentioned that Facebook is a primary source of your problems. Can you share more about your experience on Facebook and how it affects you?
It seems like you're experiencing humiliation from these online interactions. On a scale from one to 10, if you rate your embarrassment as a one, I'm impressed that you're still able to go to school and get through your day. I'd like to know what you're doing for yourself to help you cope with these feelings.
It's normal to feel frustrated and angry when people try to bring you down, especially when you're new to a school. It's important to remember that your skills and knowledge are valuable, and you shouldn't let others' perceptions or actions dictate your self-worth. Have you tried talking to a teacher or counselor at school about the situation with these girls? They might be able to help mediate the situation and create a more positive learning environment for you.
I think it's amazing that you are so smart in math and capable, and most people would think that too. So, on a scale of 1 to 10, with anger being the emotion, where do you rate yourself right now? It's great that you are not reacting with anger back at them. Remember, focus on your strengths and accomplishments, and try not to let these comments affect you.
It's good that you're not engaging in negative behavior or going after people who make you angry. It's important to find healthier ways to cope with anger. Can you tell me more about how you handle your anger and if you have tried any specific techniques to deal with it?
It's admirable that you're working on becoming more mature and trying not to worry. It's normal to have concerns about what you might see online, but it's important to focus on positive and healthy content. If you could let me know specifically what makes you worried, I can provide more tailored advice to help you cope with those concerns.
It sounds like the negativity on social media is causing you a lot of stress. On a scale from one to 10, where is your level of worry? It's important to acknowledge how this is affecting you and consider setting boundaries or taking breaks from social media if needed.
I understand that you're trying to lessen the impact of that emotion on you. One way to do this is to focus on the positive aspects of your life and remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments. By shifting your perspective, you can give less importance to that emotion and gradually move up the scale.
It's normal that certain things can affect us and cause worry. Acknowledging your feelings and being aware of them is a great start. Try to focus on your coping mechanisms and consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about your concerns. Remember, it's okay to feel hurt or nervous, but don't let those feelings control your actions.
I'm glad to hear that you like the idea of taking things one day at a time. I or someone else will be helping you throughout the process, and you will hear the same advice consistently. It's important to focus on today and not let future concerns interfere with your progress. Is there anything specific you'd like to work on for the rest of the day?
It sounds like you have a plan for the rest of the day, and that's great. Remember, take it a day at a time and find your comfort zone. In terms of filling out the assessment package, I'd like to encourage you to be as honest as possible, as it will help us better understand your situation and provide the necessary support. Also, attending meetings could offer additional perspective and a sense of community, so give it a try when you're ready.
It's crucial to be as honest as possible to get the most accurate results and help, but if you feel strongly about some questions, it's alright to give false answers to five of them. Try to be honest with the rest to make the most of our conversation.
It's natural to have fears about different things in life. It seems like your current situation isn't causing you the same level of fear as other experiences. However, it's important to address any concerns you might have and find ways to cope with them. Can you tell me more about your worries related to being homeless?
It sounds like you were not afraid during the incident due to your heightened emotional state, but now that things have calmed down, the uncertainty of the situation is causing you anxiety. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and consider seeking support from a professional or a trusted individual to help you process and navigate through them. Can you tell me if there has been any recent change in your life that might be influencing your current emotions?
I'm glad to see that you're making progress and working on your communication with your parents. It's normal for the process to be challenging. As your counsellor, my role is to support you, but it's important for you to build your own communication skills with them. Is there a specific concern or topic you'd like help preparing for in your conversation with your parents?
I understand your concerns, and it's completely natural to feel a little anxious about your performance. Remember that the observation period is meant for me to understand your situation and provide support. While it is important to be genuine and honest, know that we are here to help you grow and improve. So, ensure you take this time as an opportunity to learn and develop.
It's understandable that you might feel scared, but it's a good sign that you're recognizing your fears. Remember that communication plays a vital role in relationships. Take some time to think about it and write down your thoughts. Then, when you feel ready and more comfortable, try discussing the matter with the concerned people.
It's completely normal to feel scared about the situation. In our program, we aim to create an environment where people can be honest and open. It's also crucial to remember that it's okay to feel vulnerable, and the purpose of the program is to help you. The more genuine you are, the more progress you will make, and they will be able to recognize that.
That's a good sign. You're right, you're on the right path. It's natural to feel scared during this process since it's a 90-day program. Fear can be a strong motivator for change. Just make sure to stay dedicated, and don't be afraid to express your emotions during our sessions.
I understand your fear and the seriousness of the situation. It's okay to feel scared, but it's essential to address this fear and work on finding solutions. Can you share more about what's causing this situation and what steps you've taken to resolve it so far?
People's recovery experiences can be different. Some might not be honest in the beginning but gradually become more genuine as the treatment progresses. It's important not to compare yourself to others but focus on your own progress. If you have concerns about your roommate's behavior, you may discuss with the group facilitator or counselor for further guidance.
It's great that you're aware of this habit and want to reduce it. Instead of completely stopping it, try to gradually limit the number of times you bull crap per day. For example, if you do it five to ten times a day, try to cut down to four or eight times. Keep track of your progress and continue to decrease the frequency until you find a manageable level.
I apologize if it seemed like I was being too directive or not truly understanding your situation. As a counsellor, my goal is to support and guide you through your issues. If you could provide more specific details about how you're feeling or what you'd like to discuss, I'd be happy to adjust my approach and better address your concerns.
Attending AA meetings and having a sponsor can be beneficial for recovery and support, as they provide a community of people who share similar experiences and can help you navigate through difficult times. If you are hesitant about attending, can you share more about your concerns or any specific reasons why you don't want to go to these meetings?
It's normal to feel out of place when trying to adjust to new routines, especially after going through detox. Give yourself some time to adapt to the change. It's not unusual to take longer to get used to new things compared to others. Meanwhile, it might be helpful to talk to other people in the group and see if they have any tips for adjusting to the new schedule. Remember, everyone's experience might be different, and it's okay to take your time.
It's interesting that you're waking up earlier than usual. Sometimes, changes in our sleep patterns can be related to factors such as stress, lifestyle, or health. How have your daily routines and stress levels been lately? A slight adjustment in your bedtime or daily activities might help with this change in sleep pattern.
It sounds like you've been through a lot in these programs and you feel that they haven't been helpful to you. I understand that it can be frustrating to go through multiple programs without seeing progress. Can you tell me more about your experience in these programs and what you think is missing in your previous treatment?
It sounds like your family is quite upset with you for some reason. Have there been any incidents or changes in your life that may have caused this rift? Let's explore any possible reasons for their behavior, and try to find a way to rebuild the communication and trust with your family members.
It's completely normal to feel nervous during your first counseling session. Remember, I'm here to help, and our goal is to work together in finding ways to improve your well-being. Can you please tell me more about the specific concerns that led you to seek counseling?
It's great to hear that you are finding your new environment more enjoyable than the previous one. It is not uncommon for people to feel surprised by the demographics of a new location. If you have any concerns or questions about adjusting to your new surroundings, feel free to ask.
It's good to hear that your experience here hasn't been too negative, but I understand that the food may not be to your liking. Is there anything else that's bothering you or any aspect of your experience that you would like to discuss further?
It's understandable that there are aspects of the program you don't enjoy, like the food and the limited hours. However, it's fantastic to hear that you don't want drugs anymore and you're committed to change. Are there any other challenges you're facing that might impact your progress in recovery?
It sounds like you're struggling with your current schedule, especially with waking up early and going for walks. Have you considered discussing your concerns with those who established this routine? They might be open to making adjustments that better suit your needs and preferences.
As a counsellor, since the patient has not shared any specific concerns or feelings, all I can offer right now is reassurance and support. I'll say, 'You're welcome! I'm glad we have a session scheduled for tomorrow so we can continue to work together. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.'
I understand your concern about your family not wanting to communicate with you. In our facility, we try to involve families through family groups. While I am confident I can convince them to attend the session, I cannot guarantee that they will actively listen to you. However, these meetings usually support relatives in addressing communication issues and help them process their emotions. So there's a chance your family may be more receptive during the session.
Oh, I understand how that can be confusing. We did the screening and talked to them beforehand. It's important for us to gather information from all parties involved to better understand your situation. It might feel strange at first, but it's part of the process to help you. Sometimes, in the process of counseling, we have to make certain decisions, like cutting the strings, so that we can help you move forward. If you have any concerns, please feel free to discuss them with me.
It's understandable that you're concerned about your family and brother. Our goal as counsellors is to help bring families together, reconcile differences, and make decisions that are satisfying for everyone involved. So, yes, we will try our best to bring your brother in for a session when he is available. It may not be easy, but we'll make an effort to facilitate communication and hopefully begin the healing process for your family.
It's understandable that you miss the connection you once had with your family and want to improve your relationship with them. One solution could be to reach out and have an open and honest discussion about your feelings. Share your concerns and try to understand their perspective as well. Seeking family therapy or counseling together can also be helpful in rebuilding the communication and trust that you once had in each other.
I can understand why their exaggerations might be hurtful to you. It is important to acknowledge what you have done to help your family, even if they don't recognize your efforts. Do you think you could have a conversation with them about your feelings and try to clarify your intentions? This could help address the apparent miscommunication and improve your relationship.
It can be challenging to understand our parents' intentions, especially when their actions have been inconsistent. It's important to have open communication with them about how their words and actions are affecting you. Can you give me an example of something they've said to you recently that has caused concern?
It's understandable to feel frustrated when someone hangs up on you during a conversation. It sounds like you want to improve your communication skills to keep the conversation going. Can you tell me more about the situations where this typically happens? Based on that, I can help you find the right strategies to engage the other person and have more effective conversations.
Of course, it's completely understandable that sharing your feelings with a large group can be intimidating. You have the choice to either share your feelings with the group or not, and talking to me instead is definitely an option. You may find that one-on-one conversations are more comfortable for you and allow for deeper exploration of your thoughts and emotions.
It's completely fine if you don't want to hug them. Part of the recovery program is to talk to the group, not necessarily hug them. If you're uncomfortable with hugging, you can just sit down, be cool, and participate in the group discussions. Remember, your comfort matters too. Is there any other concern about participating in the group discussions?
It's completely understandable that you may feel nervous during a counselling session, especially when it's new for you. Sweating is a natural response to stress or anxiety, and it will likely lessen as you grow more comfortable with the counselling process. Remember that my goal is to help you, not to scare you. If you have any concerns about our sessions or feel uncomfortable, please feel free to discuss them with me so we can work together to address them.
It's interesting how your anxiety is affecting your interactions with others. It's important to remember that most people don't have any intentions to yell at you or put you down. Are there any specific situations or past experiences that might have led to these feelings?
It's natural to feel anxious or nervous during a confrontation, even if it isn't outwardly aggressive. Your body's response is a reflection of the fight-or-flight response triggered by a perceived threat. It's important to remember that everyone reacts differently, and there's no shame in feeling this way. If you want to better understand your reaction, could you provide more context about the situation and your relationship with the person involved?
I understand your concern, and it's great that you've already made some changes. Our success rate is much better, and while I don't have the exact number, what's most important is your commitment and determination to make a positive change in your life. You have the power to overcome these challenges, and we're here to help you every step of the way.
It's great to hear you're starting to believe in your ability to bring change. Acknowledging your fear and deciding what you want to hear from others is a good start. Remember, learning to communicate differently and taking it one day at a time will help you gradually see the change seep into your life.
It's great to hear that you're willing to take things one day at a time. When you go to your group session, keep in mind that it's a safe space for sharing your experiences and thoughts. You can definitely talk about our conversation, but also remember to respect the privacy and boundaries of others. If you're unsure about what to say, you can always ask the group facilitator for guidance.
Recovery is an ongoing journey, and it's good that you're taking it one day at a time. If your parents have a hard time believing you, try explaining to them how dedicated you are to your recovery process and the positive changes you have made so far. They might need some time to adjust to your progress, but eventually, your actions will speak louder than your words. Is there a specific incident that has led you to believe that they won't trust your commitment?
As a counsellor, it seems that your son is making a thoughtful commitment to changing his behavior and focusing on living in the present moment. It's great that he decided to adopt a more positive approach, and it's understandable that your father would be impressed with this change in attitude. What specific actions do you think your son could take to follow through on his commitment?
It's great to see that you're making progress by focusing on the present moment instead of trying to escape. Taking one day at a time means giving yourself the chance to adjust and grow without overwhelming yourself with future worries or expectations. It's completely normal for this process to feel strange at first, but with time, you'll adapt and continue to surprise yourself in positive ways.
It sounds like you're feeling stuck since your parents have stopped communicating with you, and your attempts to reach out to them haven't been successful. I can understand that this might be frustrating and confusing for you. Have things changed recently that might have led to this change in their behavior?
It's great to hear that you're following a routine and taking responsibility for your daily tasks. When you went to group, did you participate actively and share your thoughts and experiences with others?
It's great to hear that you actively participated in the group session and were honest about your feelings. Support groups can be helpful for sharing experiences and learning from others. It's important to take one day at a time and focus on your healing process. Talking about your goals and seeking support is a positive step towards recovery.
It sounds like you are trying to engage in the group therapy in a positive way. However, it's important to remember that the purpose of group therapy is to share your thoughts and feelings openly, so focus on expressing yourself genuinely rather than trying to figure out what others want to hear. As for writing a letter or discussing how to be a better son, brother, or friend, that might be a helpful exercise in self-reflection. But before you do that, try to give yourself some time to get comfortable in the group and have more open conversations.
As a counsellor, I believe in being congruent, which means your outside behavior should match your inside motivation. However, it's important to acknowledge that progress and change take time, and it's not expected that you will be fully congruent right from the start of the program. It's a process that takes time and effort.
I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better and laughing now. It's important to find moments of joy even during difficult times. What was stopping you from feeling this way before, and how can we work together to help you maintain this positive feeling?
I'm glad to hear you can find humor without drugs. Regarding other counselors, I can't speak for them specifically, but we all generally have the same approach to people. We do have staff meetings where we communicate with each other, so rest assured, the team's goal is to provide the best support for you.
It's great that you recognize the need for improvement in your relationship with your family. It's important to communicate your feelings and concerns with them in an open and honest manner. You can also explore the reasons behind the issues and work together to find solutions. Do you have any specific challenges within the family that you'd like to discuss?
You just said something very important there - 'I need help'. It shows self-awareness and willingness to seek assistance. Is that a new thought or have you always felt this way? Either way, it's a positive step, and the next course of action is to identify the specific areas you need help with and discuss the appropriate strategies or resources to address them.
It's great that you've taken the initiative to seek help and have come to talk to me. Admitting that we need help can be a challenging step, but it's important for personal growth and healing. Let's discuss the specific issues you're facing so we can work together on finding the best approach to address them.
It sounds like you're struggling with your past experiences with drugs and want to find a way to deal with it. Is there a specific area where you need help, such as finding support or overcoming cravings? I'm here to listen and help you navigate through this difficult time.
It's great to see that you want to make a sincere effort this time. Instead of trying to force your way through, let's work on identifying your goals and planning manageable steps to achieve them. Please share what exactly you want to accomplish and any challenges that have held you back in the past.
It's understandable that you feel guilty about your emotions given your family's sacrifices. Can you please share more about your family dynamic, including your siblings and any extended family? Understanding the key relationships in your life can help us work through these emotions, and find a way for you to better connect with them without feeling guilty.
I can understand how experiencing a different family dynamic in your childhood can leave an impact on you. It seems like the affectionate atmosphere in Columbia resonated with you, even though it was different from your own family. I encourage you to consider if there are ways you can bring that warmth into your current family relationships. How has that difference in family cultures influenced your relationships with your family now?
I want to acknowledge that it's great you came in today to talk about your emotions, especially since it's not something you or your family discuss often. Your willingness to explore these feelings demonstrates strength. Is there a specific reason why you feel scared to initiate communication that you want to share?
I'm glad to hear that the session has helped you in lifting that weight off your shoulders and that the keywords we discussed really resonated with you. It's important to acknowledge and express our emotions, so I encourage you to continue exploring those feelings and identify ways to cope with them. If you have any further questions or concerns about your emotions or experiences, feel free to ask.
It's good that you acknowledge your feelings and try to work through it. You don't need to feel like a burden when talking to friends, but it's essential to have a support network when dealing with emotions. Deep conversations can help you gain new perspectives and feel less isolated. Would you consider opening up more to your friends or seeking professional help to discuss your emotions further?
It sounds like you are struggling with a lot of internal pressure and emotions that you're trying to suppress. It's essential to allow yourself to feel and process these emotions to avoid being overwhelmed. Have you considered talking to a therapist or seeking support to address these feelings and learn healthy coping mechanisms?
It sounds like you're experiencing pressure from different sources including family expectations and your own self-imposed timeline. It's natural to feel lonely in these situations. It's important to remember that everyone's journey is different, and it's okay to create your own path. Have you considered talking to your family about the challenges you're facing and the feelings of loneliness you're experiencing?
Thank you for sharing your concerns. It can be difficult to navigate family expectations when they might not align with your own life choices or feelings. It's important to take time to reflect on what feels authentic to you. What aspects of your relationship with your family do you think are most important to you, and how do you think they might react if they were to know your true feelings regarding your sexual orientation?
Thank you for sharing your concerns. It's common for people in their mid-20s to feel societal pressure to settle down and follow a more traditional path. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to live your life, and it is important to make choices that are right for you, not just because others are doing it. As a gay individual, you have various options like adoption, surrogacy, or being a single parent. Take your time to explore these possibilities and don't rush into any decision just because of external pressure.
It's normal to feel this way when you see your close friends reaching milestones like marriage. It's important to remember that everyone's life journey is different and there's no set timeline for anyone. Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own personal growth and experiences. If you're comfortable, could you share more about your feelings of falling behind?
It is understandable that you are feeling pressured by societal expectations and family dynamics. It's important to remember that your personal happiness and well-being comes first, and that it is okay if your life's path differs from societal norms or from what your parents expect. Communicating about this with your parents or seeking support from other people who understand your situation may help you cope with this pressure and disappointment better. How does the lack of open communication with your parents make you feel?
It seems like you might have some unresolved feelings about your mom's friendship with her ex. It's important to acknowledge and process your emotions to better understand what you need in order to find closure. If you feel comfortable, you can try discussing this with your mom or another trusted individual to gain their perspective and insight.
It sounds like you're experiencing some tension due to the lack of emotional communication in your family. This might make it challenging for you to express your feelings openly. Have you ever tried discussing this communication style with your parents, or considered seeking professional help to improve your family's communication dynamics?
It's important to acknowledge and address your feelings, even if they may seem insignificant. Can you provide a little more information about what is causing you to feel uneasy?
It's understandable that you feel this way, given the immense responsibility that was placed on you from a young age. But, it's also important to recognize that your role as a caregiver and protector for your siblings has likely made a significant impact on their lives. As for your own feelings, do you find it difficult to let go of the past, or do you think you would benefit from finding ways to reclaim some of those carefree childhood experiences as an adult?

It's great to see that you acknowledge the possibility of receiving help. Remember, reaching out to people and seeking support is crucial during challenging times. You are not alone, and there are others who also need help. Feel free to explore available resources, such as support groups or professional counseling, to get the assistance you need.

And if you find this issue persisting, you might want to consider adjusting your teaching methods or seeking feedback from your students.

Are there any specific thoughts or beliefs that are causing you distress in this situation?
First of all, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. It's important to recognize and accept that others may have different skills and knowledge than you. Try focusing on your own growth and learning, rather than comparing yourself to others. As for your colleague's presentation, it shows that even highly educated individuals can struggle in certain areas. Remember, you too have your strengths, and they might just be different from your colleagues'. Do you think there's something particular you can improve to feel more confident around them?
It's not uncommon to compare ourselves to others, but it's important to remember that everyone has their unique skills and qualities.

Do you have any specific accomplishments or strengths that you're proud of?

It's unfortunate that you experienced judgement from others for your past relationships. It's important to remember that your choices are your own, and people's opinions don't define you. How has this judgement affected your self-esteem or current relationships?
It seems like you've been struggling with these feelings for a long time and had hoped that your current situation would bring some relief.

As a counsellor, I understand your brother has older siblings who spoiled him, and consider how this might have shaped his behavior and personality. It is important to remember that everyone's upbringing is different, and the way we are raised can play a significant role in our adult lives. Please feel free to share more about your brother's situation and whether there are any particular concerns or problems you would like to discuss.
As a counsellor, I can see that you are very proud of your two older sons and their achievements. It's great to know that they are doing well in their respective fields. It must bring you a lot of joy and satisfaction to see your children thriving. Keep on supporting and encouraging them on their journeys.
As a counsellor, I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's important to recognize that each child may require a unique approach to parenting, based on their individual needs and personality. Can you please give me some examples of how your approach differs between your sons and Nadia, and the challenges you are facing with this?
I understand your concern for your daughter's well-being and the importance you place on family honor. However, it's important to recognize that every individual needs some room for personal growth and learning experiences. Maybe you could consider giving her some space to develop her own resilience while still offering support and guidance. What are some specific behaviors or situations that worry you about your daughter?
It sounds like you prioritize your family and children above all else, which is understandable. It must be difficult to balance your career and personal life. Have you considered discussing this with your employer to explore alternative opportunities that don't require extended travel or other ways to maintain both aspects of your life?
I understand that the constant arguments and tension at home can be overwhelming. It's important to address these issues, both with your daughter and other family members. Have you considered trying family therapy or having open conversations about your feelings? This may help in addressing these underlying issues and finding a way to ease the tension in your household.
I understand your concerns and I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me. My plan is to meet with your daughter, Nadia, next week to understand her perspective on the situation. I'll also speak with your husband separately. After gathering information from all parties, we'll come together as a family to discuss potential solutions and help Nadia get back on track. You have a wonderful family and your dedication as a mother and wife is commendable. We'll work together to achieve that stability and peace you desire in your home.
It seems like you did the best you could in that difficult situation, and you're being strong by acknowledging the harsh reality that the child could've died without your intervention. As a counsellor, what do you think could help you to stop questioning yourself and develop more self-confidence in your decisions?
Acknowledging your struggle to overcome self-blame and improving your confidence in decision-making is an important first step. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and we cannot control everything. In order to address your negative thoughts, it's crucial to challenge them when they arise and practice self-compassion. Additionally, seeking therapy or support from a professional will help you develop healthier psychological patterns to prevent the chances of backsliding into self-blame and doubt. Also, bear in mind that change takes time, so be patient with yourself and the process.
It's important to recognize your own strengths and achievements, especially in difficult circumstances like raising your kids on your own. You've demonstrated competence in your professional life, but it's crucial to work on personal integrity and self-belief. Try identifying areas in which you feel you've succeeded and practice self-affirmations. Remember, your self-worth isn't defined by others, but by how you see yourself. Would you like to discuss any specific experiences you've had when feeling bullied or lacking confidence?
As a counsellor, it's important to acknowledge that doing your best under certain circumstances is commendable, and adopting a different perspective can make a significant difference. It's a great idea to reflect on your actions and decisions at the end of the day. This will not only help you build self-confidence but also ensure you've provided the best care possible. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. Practice is essential, and it's perfectly normal for this kind of mindset shift to take time to become ingrained.
It's great that you're reflecting on your decisions and care provided to patients. Building confidence takes time, so remember not to be too hard on yourself. At the end of the day, it's important to acknowledge your successes and learn from any mistakes made. As you continue to reflect and gain more experience, your confidence should naturally grow. If you still have concerns, is there a specific aspect of your care that you feel less confident about?
It's important to recognize that your relationship with yourself is what we're focusing on right now, even though it was influenced by your relationship with your mom. It's not uncommon for people to unintentionally develop certain traits or behaviors due to past experiences. Acknowledge what you've discovered about yourself and try to gain a better understanding of the factors that contributed to it. Also, reflect on how to improve your relationship with yourself going forward. Have you considered any specific strategies or steps to improve your self-treatment?
It's important to acknowledge that this voice, whether it's a bully or your mom, has become a part of you. It might not go away easily, but recognizing its presence is a big step. Why don't you try to give this voice a name, and we can work on addressing it and reducing its influence on your wellbeing?
As a counsellor, I appreciate your willingness to work on a compromise. To become a happier and healthier person, try acknowledging your accomplishments and focus on your strengths. As you start to act stronger and take ownership of your achievements, allow yourself to be kinder to yourself. Remember, it's a process and we're here to support you on this journey.
It's great that you're working on giving yourself credit and reducing self-blame. Remember, we can't control everything, and you should focus on what's in your control. As for the recent incident, it sounds like you made the right decision by attending to the post-op surgery patient first. How can you remind yourself that your actions were appropriate in that situation when faced with similar scenarios in the future?
It sounds like you made a difficult decision under pressure and ultimately, it had a positive outcome. You were able to save a child's life by catching the mistake. That shows strength and a keen sense of responsibility on your part. It's natural to feel uncertain about your actions, but it's important to recognize that your decision had a significant impact on that child's life. How do you feel about your choice now, knowing that you were able to save their life?
I'm glad to hear that you benefitted from the relaxation skills. However, it's important to give yourself credit for applying those skills and meeting your goal. It seems like this has been a recurring theme in our sessions. We can continue to work on building your confidence and self-acknowledgment. You mentioned something that went on at work; do you want to discuss that further?
It's understandable that you're feeling guilty, but it's important to remember that you acted quickly and managed to get the child the help they needed. The responsibility for the medication error lies with the previous nurse, not you. It's impossible to predict everything that could happen in a shift, and your actions ultimately led to the child's survival. Try to acknowledge your role in saving the child's life and learn from this experience.
It sounds like you were faced with a difficult decision and prioritized based on the information available to you at the time. It's important to remember that you can't predict everything, and you were doing your best in that moment. How do you feel about the outcome now?
I'm glad to hear that the relaxation techniques were helping you initially. It's normal for unexpected events to disrupt our progress. Let's first discuss how the relaxation has been working for you so far, and then we can address the challenging day at the hospital, and explore strategies to help you cope with such situations in the future.
It's great to hear that you were able to use the relaxation skills effectively and achieve a state of relaxation that allowed you to fall asleep. It's important to recognize your own role in implementing these techniques and give yourself credit for making progress. Did you find any particular muscle group or part of the process especially helpful in reaching that relaxed state?
It's great to hear that the structured relaxation techniques are helping you sleep better. It's quite unusual for someone who's just starting to be able to apply it effectively in real situations, so you seem to be particularly adept at that. Your conscientiousness and dedication can be both a challenge and an asset in this process. Just remember to focus on your own well-being and finding balance, instead of solely pleasing others.
The exercise we will try involves visualizing your alter-ego in another chair, to help you examine and challenge the negative thoughts in your head by externalizing them. By focusing on the recent incident, we can delve into how you feel about it and understand what's going on inside you. Remember, it might feel strange, but this exercise has helped others in the past.
Thank you for sharing this experience. It sounds like your therapist was using a technique called chair work, which is designed to help you explore different aspects of yourself and become more aware of your self-criticism. It can be challenging, but it's a useful way to understand your thoughts and feelings. You might want to ask your therapist for more guidance on how to work on your self-criticism and better understand why you feel this way.
It seems like the situation triggered your sensitivity and made you feel blamed, which can be quite distressing. It's important to remember that it's not always possible to foresee everything that can happen. Could you tell me more about what happened in that situation to better understand the context?
I understand that you feel criticized and accused, even when you're aware that you can't control everything. You mentioned that this situation triggers deeper issues you've been working on. Can you provide more details about those issues and how criticism affects you personally? It's important to understand the root cause to better handle such situations and improve your emotional response.
It seems like you're sensitive to feeling blamed for the situation, and the mother's shock and worry may have come across as blame directed at you. It's important to recognize that the chaotic environment could have contributed to this perception, and not to dwell on it too much. Is there any specific part of the situation that worries you the most?
It seems like you're struggling with intrusive thoughts and self-blame. It's helpful to recognize that these thoughts have been present for a while, and they're not just related to the recent situation at work. You mentioned that you're constantly trying to please others because of your upbringing. Can you tell me more about your childhood experiences that could have contributed to this mindset?
I understand that feeling frustrated and the need to defend yourself can be exhausting. Could you provide more information about the situation and the person who is picking on you? This will help us work on potential solutions to address the issue and reduce your frustration.
It's understandable that you feel frustrated when someone questions your competence, especially when it comes to raising your children. Try to remember that you're doing the best you can given your circumstances, and it's important to acknowledge the positive aspects of your parenting. As for the person causing you frustration, consider having an open and honest conversation with them to express your feelings and address their concerns. Can you think of a way to approach this conversation in a constructive manner?
It must be quite frustrating to feel like your efforts are never acknowledged or appreciated. It's important to remember that no one is perfect, and we all have our strengths and weaknesses. As long as you are doing your best, taking care of yourself and your children, you should be proud of your accomplishments. It might be helpful to have a conversation with those who are critical of you and set boundaries, letting them know how their comments affect you. Is there a specific person with whom you find it difficult to communicate or whose criticism is particularly hurtful?
It seems like you believe you have a responsibility to support and protect others. While it's great to offer help, it's important to remember that people are capable of handling their own problems, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs sometimes as well. Can you think of any specific instance where you felt too responsible for someone else and it affected your well-being?
I understand your concern with setting high expectations and feeling like they're unreachable. It's important to recognize that making your standards more realistic doesn't mean lowering the bar, but rather adjusting it to reflect your true capabilities and the constraints of your situation. By making your standards more attainable, you can start focusing on your progress and eventually feel satisfied with your achievements. Can you identify any specific situations where you feel your expectations are too high?
It sounds like you've been dealing with feelings of inadequacy and constantly striving for your mother's acceptance. It's important to recognize that your worth is not determined by her opinions. What is one thing you value about yourself that gives you a sense of self-worth, independent of your mother's judgement?
I understand that you wanted to break the cycle of pressure you experienced from your mother. It's commendable that you've made an effort to build a healthier relationship with your children. However, it's natural for your mother to have had some influence, especially during challenging times. It's important to recognize and appreciate her assistance while continuing to maintain your parenting style. Have you talked to your children about how they feel about their relationship with your mother and if they've experienced any pressure?
It's great that you recognize the need to build confidence and believe in yourself. One way to start appreciating your achievements and giving yourself credit is to maintain a daily journal. Reflect on your day, note down your accomplishments, and take time to acknowledge them. Additionally, it might help if you surround yourself with positive influences and seek their encouragement. Remember, it is a learning process and it will take time and practice. I am here to support and guide you through it.
It's important to recognize the good that you've done, like saving the child, while also accepting that you can't always achieve perfection. It's good to strive for improvement, but keep in mind that a perfect score isn't a realistic goal for anyone. Give yourself credit for your accomplishments and have compassion for yourself when things don't go as planned. If you could, what would be one thing you think might help you get closer to a five while still understanding that perfection is not the ultimate goal?
It's important to recognize that nobody is perfect, and striving for perfection can be exhausting and detrimental to your mental health. Instead of focusing on achieving perfection, try to shift your mindset to being more self-accepting. In situations where you feel you're not doing the best possible thing, ask yourself if you have done your best given the circumstances and resources you have. If the answer is yes, then allow yourself to consider it a five, not a four. Remember, self-acceptance comes from within; you need to be more compassionate and patient with yourself.
I understand that you feel defensive about the situation, and it's natural to feel the need to clarify your actions. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's not necessarily your fault that the other nurse made an error. It's crucial that you focus on the work you did and recognize that you prioritized the patients based on their needs. Given that you often feel like a failure, do you usually find it hard to stand up for yourself in situations like this?
It's natural to feel responsible in such situations, but constantly blaming yourself isn't helpful. Acceptance is the key to healing. Let's try to reframe these thoughts and focus on what you can learn from the situation. What positive actions could you take moving forward to ensure something similar doesn't happen again? This might help you regain a sense of control and start accepting the past.
I understand your frustration in this situation, as you took necessary action to save the child's life while your coworker seems to be shifting blame. It's important to focus on the fact that you did what any trained nurse would do, and your actions were in the best interest of the patient. To address the issue with your coworker, consider discussing the situation further with them or with a supervisor to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that proper procedures are followed in the future.
It sounds like you've made a strong connection with your child and you're trying your best to protect them from potentially harmful influences. It's great that you are focusing on being present and mindful of your child's experiences. Spontaneity and being in the moment can really enhance your bond with your child and help them develop a more balanced understanding of the world. It's also important to trust your instincts as a parent and not be swayed by others' opinions. Keep nurturing this connection and continue to be present with your child.
There's that shame and criticalness again. It gets in the way of your relationships, and being present in the way you want for your loved ones. You said these things like being scatterbrained and stressed out impact your life negatively. It’s important to distinguish between helpful and unhelpful thoughts. What's the helpful part of not feeling good about being stressed out easily and saying things to yourself? Try to use these realizations to motivate change and let go of the unhelpful thoughts that make it hard to bounce back.
It seems like you value having meaningful relationships in your life and you're not satisfied with your current situation. Have you tried exploring new ways of connecting with people or joining groups that share similar interests to help build these relationships?
It seems like you've done a great job creating a nurturing environment for your child. He appears to be a happy and wonderful kid, thanks to your attentive and engaged parenting style. I'm curious to know how you managed to create such a fun and magical space during the homeschooling process, and if you think your own ADHD played a role in helping you tune in to your child's needs so well?
I understand that you're going through a challenging time with these forgetful incidents happening frequently. What I'm noticing is that there's a significant improvement from our last session, as the critical inner voice seems to be less present. I'm curious to know if you can identify any specific changes or coping strategies you're applying to improve your memory or handle these situations better.
It's important to be present in the moment and acknowledge one's imperfections. It's a healthy way to process emotions and experiences. It's great that you find relief in sharing your thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or hiding. Remember, it's okay to be vulnerable and open up in a safe space like this. I encourage you to continue to do so.
As your counsellor, on Wednesday, the three of us will meet together initially. Then, I will have you step out briefly while I check in with the other person. After that, I'll bring you back into the session, and the other person will talk to you about some concerns or topics we feel are important for our discussion.
It's great to hear that you opened up to your mom about your struggles. As a counsellor, I understand that dealing with depression can be really challenging. It's important to remind yourself that you're working hard to overcome these challenges. Acknowledging and sharing your feelings with your support system like your mom is a crucial step towards healing. Remember, you're not alone, and there are people around you who care and want to help.
I'm so impressed with your efforts to strengthen your relationships. It's important to work towards the values that matter to you, like building and maintaining meaningful connections with others. Keep up the good work and continue to take steps in this positive direction. If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to share them.
It's understandable that you're feeling this way, as you've been through a lot recently. Emotional fluctuations can be quite common in times of stress. It's great that you're feeling better now, but it's essential to remember to take care of yourself and give yourself some time to cope with all the changes. Is there a specific event or situation that has contributed to this emotional rollercoaster?
It's okay to not have a straight answer right away, and it's normal to experience vague thoughts at times. If you're unsure about your feelings or intentions, perhaps you could try exploring them more. You can start by asking yourself: What emotions am I experiencing right now and what might be causing them? It might be helpful to discuss this further with someone you trust if you're comfortable doing so.
It's great to hear that you took a responsible approach to deal with the issue about the stolen library books and card. It's normal to not have a direct answer to how you feel at times. In order to feel a sense of wellness, it's important to continue facing challenges and handling situations with a positive attitude, much like you did today. I encourage you to keep taking small steps towards improvement and you'll eventually see an overall change in how you feel.
I can see that you're doing a really good job, as the love and care you have for your loved one is evident. In our next session, I will help your loved one begin to talk about what's going on for them, and I'll assist you in listening and supporting them better. It's important to remember that your presence and efforts are valuable in this situation.
It sounds like you both care about each other's feelings, and it's important to remember that everyone can unintentionally cause stress or misunderstandings in a relationship. Consider having an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and how you both can work on expressing yourselves better. Remember, communication is key to resolving any conflicts and preventing resentment from building up.
It seems like you're experiencing negative thoughts about yourself due to your ADHD, especially in regards to your parenting abilities. Remember, having ADHD doesn't make you a bad parent, and it's important to focus on your strengths and the love you provide for your child. Are there any strategies or tools you've tried to help manage your ADHD symptoms and improve family organization?
It sounds like you're comparing yourself to others and experiencing self-doubt when alone. Instead of focusing on the negative emotions, try to practice self-compassion in those moments, acknowledging that everyone has their struggles, and you are not alone. Is there something you do to cope with these feelings when you're alone?
It's understandable that you had a hard time having compassion for yourself in that situation. Experiencing something like a car break-in can be very distressing and overwhelming. It's important to acknowledge your feelings and be gentle with yourself during these times. As for your conversation with Noah, you might want to reflect on why you reacted that way and consider having an open and honest discussion with him about it. Can you identify any factors that led to your cynical reaction?
As a counsellor, I understand your concerns about building trust with your son. It's important to help him feel comfortable opening up to you and foster connections with his friends. On Wednesday, let's try to focus on some strategies to gently encourage communication and connection, while being mindful of not pushing him too hard or too fast, as this could create more distance. Remember, it's normal for parents to have doubts, but working together on this issue will improve your relationship with your son.
It's important to create a comfortable environment for your child to open up. One approach is to use reflective listening techniques. For example, if your child shares a story about running in the hall to tell a friend something, try to gently reflect back their experience by saying, 'Oh, so you were running down the hall to talk to Johnny?'. This can encourage them to elaborate further. After they've shared more of their story, you can later address other issues like running in the hall. Give this strategy a try and use it multiple times to help your child feel more comfortable talking about their feelings with you.
It's important to understand that validating your child's feelings is not the same as agreeing with him. By acknowledging his emotions and saying something like, 'I can see how that really stresses you out, I understand how it feels when I get stressed out,' you show that you care about his experience. This can help build a stronger connection and improve communication between both of you. Is there a specific situation you would like to discuss?
That's great to hear that you've been practicing the breathing exercise. It can definitely be helpful in managing your stress. The key is to practice regularly so that it becomes a reflex, particularly when you're not triggered. This will help you catch yourself in the moment and manage your stress effectively. Keep up the good work!
That's wonderful that you want to be there for Noah and take care of him. When a kid can turn to their parent and talk about their problems, they tend to get less depressed or anxious. Just remember to practice active listening by giving him your full attention and empathy, and asking open-ended questions. It's also important to be patient with the process, as it takes time for both of you to build trust and communication. We can continue working on this in our next session, and I will provide you with additional tips and tools to help you support Noah.
It's possible that other parents also feel stressed and disorganized at times and that you might not be alone in this experience. It would be interesting to ask other moms, especially single moms, about their experiences. Have you ever heard the term 'mommy-brain?' People often use this term to describe the feeling of being scattered and forgetful that can come with the demands of parenting. Instead of focusing only on the negatives, consider the evidence that you are a good mom, like your dedication to staying home with your child.
It seems like that critical voice is your depression trying to bring you down and make you doubt your abilities as a mother. You mentioned you used to have confidence, and you've started taking steps towards feeling better, like going to the library despite usually avoiding it. It's important to recognize the progress you're making and know that we can't completely get rid of negative thoughts, but we can work on noticing when they arise and not letting them take over. Keep taking steps towards your values, as that will help build your confidence back up.
It's normal for parents to experience ups and downs in their confidence levels. It's important to recognize that nobody is perfect, and parenting is a learning experience. Instead of focusing on whether you're good enough, try to focus on the positive aspects of your parenting and learn from any mistakes. Remember that it's okay to ask for help when needed and that seeking support can also positively impact your skills as a parent.
It's normal for parents to have doubts about their parenting skills, and no parent is perfect. The fact that you care about your child's well-being and nutrition shows that you are invested in being a good parent. A helpful strategy for improving your child's eating habits could be to try introducing healthy foods in fun, creative ways or considering family meals that include a variety of nutritious foods. Remember, it's important to be patient and not to be too hard on yourself.
It's understandable that you are concerned about your child's eating habits. It is essential to build healthy eating patterns in children early on. Instead of being too strict, you can try to gradually incorporate more vegetables and fruits into his meals. You can also try adding vegetables into his favorite dishes, like mixing them in with the noodles or cheese. Encouraging him to be involved in meal planning and cooking can also make him more open to trying new foods. Remember, it takes time and consistent effort, so it's crucial to be patient and keep trying.
I understand that losing keys and running late can be stressful. It's great that your son's comment helped you realize that you usually find what you're looking for. In moments of stress, try to remember that and take a deep breath to calm yourself down. This might help you think more clearly and find the item faster. Sometimes, stepping back for a moment, even when we feel rushed, can actually save us time in the end.
It seems that you are struggling with feeling unheard and uncared for by those around you, which must be disheartening. It's important to remember that people may not always have the answers we need or they may not understand how we feel. Have you tried having an open conversation with these people, expressing your concerns and feelings directly, so they become more aware of your needs?
It sounds like you are concerned about the depth and sincerity of communication with your loved ones, feeling that they might be holding back their true feelings to protect you from being hurt. It's important to create a safe environment for open conversations and let them know that you value their honesty and that it's alright to share their true thoughts and emotions even if they may be hard to hear. Would you consider trying to address this concern openly with them and see if it leads to more authentic communication?
I understand that you want people to be upfront and honest with you, even if it's hurtful. It's important to remember that people's intentions might be to protect you from pain. However, if you feel like it's affecting your relationships, try having a conversation with them and emphasize the importance of honesty and that you're willing to accept the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.
It sounds like you feel dismissed and invalidated by others when you try to express your feelings and experiences. It's important to remember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to seek support and understanding. Perhaps you could try discussing your thoughts and experiences with a trusted friend or family member who might be more empathetic and understanding, or consider speaking with a mental health professional.
It's wonderful to hear that you have formed a strong bond with this child and were able to make him happy while his parents were away. It shows that love goes beyond physical appearance and how relationships can develop with individuals who are not biologically related to us. Keep nurturing that connection and cherish the time you have together.
It's great to hear that you felt useful and appreciated, and that things were easier than you expected. It's not uncommon for first-time parents to feel anxious, but it's important to recognize and celebrate moments where you feel competent and at ease. Do you have any specific strategies that have helped you manage your anxiety?
It's understandable that you're feeling sad about not being able to see your friend as often as you would like. Long-distance relationships can be challenging. The good thing is that you're making an effort to stay connected through Skype. Perhaps you could try to plan occasional visits or meet halfway to spend some quality time together in person. Are there any specific challenges that come up due to this distance besides not being able to see each other as often?
It's great that you want to spend quality time with your son and show him your love. It's important for both of you to strengthen your relationship. As for your tiredness, it's essential to take care of yourself as well. If you're feeling overwhelmed, perhaps we can explore ways to manage your energy and time effectively so that both you and your son can truly enjoy your moments together.
I understand your concerns about expectations and the pressure that can come with them. It's normal to feel conflicted between wanting to connect with others and fearing disappointment. It might be helpful to start by setting boundaries and expressing your concerns to others. Remember that no one is perfect, and it's alright not to meet all expectations all the time. Part of building relationships is learning to navigate these challenges together. Can you pinpoint any specific expectations that overwhelm you the most?
I understand that it can feel like a struggle, but it's important to know that there can be benefits to spending time alone, as it allows you to become an observer and develop a sense of inner peace. It might also feel less painful than constantly fighting with yourself about it. Do you find any comfort in being alone at all?
It seems like you've built a protective barrier around yourself to avoid disappointment, but the arrival of your grandchildren has stirred up some new emotions. It's natural to question your feelings, especially when it comes to such important relationships. Have you tried spending more time with your grandchildren to see if your feelings towards them grow stronger and more positive?
It's important to know that communication is key in any relationship, including between parents and children. Instead of waiting for your son to start expressing his feelings, you could initiate the conversation and model openness so your children are more likely to follow. Share your thoughts about the relationship, let them know how much they mean to you, and mention that you'd love to hear their thoughts as well. By starting the dialogue, you might find it easier to break the spell and strengthen your relationship.
It can be frustrating when people are upset with us and we don't know why. As a counsellor, I suggest trying to initiate an open and honest conversation with your family members to understand their feelings and clear up any misunderstandings. It's important to express your own feelings and concerns as well, and try to be receptive to their perspective. Do you have any specific concerns you'd like to discuss regarding your relationship with your family?
It's completely normal to feel upset when you perceive an imbalance in the way your children show love and care. Have you tried discussing your feelings with them? It's important to communicate openly and honestly so they can understand your perspective and feelings. Remember, they might not be aware that their actions are causing you to feel this way.
It sounds like you're contemplating whether to engage with others or not to avoid exerting too much energy, both physically and emotionally. It's important to consider your mental and emotional well-being. Can you identify specific reasons or situations that make you feel this way?
I understand how avoiding emotional involvement can seem like a way to protect yourself from being hurt. However, it might also be limiting your ability to experience meaningful connections and relationships with others. What do you think could be some potential benefits of opening up more and taking the risk of getting emotionally involved with people?
It sounds like you really care about your grandkids and want to be an important part of their lives. It's natural to be worried about putting yourself out there and possibly facing rejection. Can you identify any specific experiences or situations that have contributed to this fear? Remember that building strong relationships takes time and effort, and your love for them will likely shine through in the end.
It's normal to feel nervous when discussing important topics, and it's understandable how your new role as a grandmother and career choices can lead to uncertainty. Let us focus on addressing your concerns about the future and find a way to navigate through the changes you're experiencing. Can you share any specific thoughts or emotions that have been weighing on you lately regarding these significant life events?
It's understandable that you're concerned about your tiredness, especially since it seems to be affecting your daily tasks and your ability to do things with your grandchildren. It's important to consider if anything has changed in your life recently that could be causing this level of exhaustion. It might be helpful to see a healthcare professional to discuss this tiredness further and rule out any underlying issues that could be contributing to it.
It's natural to reflect on your past experiences and energy levels, especially when comparing it to your abilities now. As a counsellor, I would suggest focusing on the activities you can still do with your grandchildren and finding new ways to connect with them.

It's great that you're taking the initiative to discuss the work with your coworker.

First, it is essential to understand that it's alright to embrace your unique qualities and interests. You have every right to enjoy the sports and activities you like.

This step could be helpful for you to build connections and gain insights.
It's understandable to feel isolated and overwhelmed, and I'm glad you reached out for support.

Have you thought about the steps you'd like to take during your transition, such as talking to your family, friends, or school administrators?
As a counsellor, I understand your concern for confidentiality. I wouldn't want to break that trust by talking to the administrators without your consent. But, let's discuss the possibility of preparing administrators to handle the situation. Can you share a specific incident or concern that you have with your classmates?
It's great to hear that you have supportive parents, and it is understandable that you feel nervous about coming out to your peers. Discussing the situation with your parents and school personnel is a good idea as they can help provide a supportive environment.

Thank you for sharing that. It's completely normal to feel scared about opening up to someone. However, it's crucial for your emotional well-being to express your feelings. Try reaching out to someone you trust and start sharing something small. This way, you can gradually build trust and feel more comfortable discussing deeper emotions. How does that sound?
The fear of rejection can certainly be challenging to deal with. It sounds like you modify your behavior to avoid this feeling, which in turn makes you feel alone and frustrated. Consider working towards being more genuine with yourself and your relationships. Can you think of any specific situations where you can be more open with your parents or friends?
It's important to have an open conversation with your parents about your feelings and the desire to be liked and accepted by them.

Remember, your feelings and identity are valid, and there are people who will accept and support you for who you are.
It's good that you are able to express your feelings of anger, frustration, and fear. Many people struggle to articulate their emotions. Recognizing and naming these emotions are important resources that we can work with. However, it is essential to find healthier ways to cope with these feelings instead of resorting to destructive behaviors like breaking things or hurting others.
As a counsellor, I would reassure you that nobody would know I am there specifically for you. I would explain that I visit many classrooms and would only notify your teacher of a routine check. No one would have any reason to assume that I am there because of you.
I'm glad you're feeling a little bit better. It's important to have someone to talk to about your experiences and to get support with any bullying you may face. I'll arrange a group for you to join where you can share your experiences, and I'll talk to your teacher first. If you have any concerns or additional questions, feel free to reach out to me.
As a counsellor, I understand your feelings of isolation, and it's entirely possible that there are other students from different ethnic backgrounds at your school who are also gay and facing similar challenges.

Have you tried joining any support groups or clubs that could help you connect with others who share your identity?
I understand that you're going through a tough time dealing with bullying due to your sexual orientation. It's normal to feel sad and angry about it. It is important to know that you're not alone in this, and there are others who share similar experiences.

This could be a safe space where you can discuss your feelings and concerns without the fear of being exposed or judged. Let me know if this is something you would be interested in.
I understand that you've been struggling with unhappiness, lack of sleep, and self-esteem issues for the past three months, and it seems to be related to not having many friends and feeling disconnected from your peers.

It's unfortunate that you've had to deal with hurtful remarks or assumptions about your sexuality. People's judgments can be hard to deal with, especially when it comes to our personal identity.

Yes, all medications do have side-effects and potential risks.

It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load with your emotions, feeling tired, frustrated, down, and sad. It's important to recognize these feelings and understand how they're affecting you. Can you share more about what might be causing this emotional exhaustion and lack of happiness in your life?
It's normal to feel like you don't have the power to lift your own spirits sometimes. However, it's important to remember that you do have the ability to overcome challenges and improve your mood. You might need to try different strategies or seek support from friends, family, or professionals, but ultimately, you have the power within you. Is there anything specific that has been affecting your mood or making you feel powerless?
It's important that you came to talk to me, as it shows that you are willing to seek help. It certainly sounds like you have been experiencing depression because of your current situation at school. The good news is that depression is treatable, and engaging in therapy can be highly beneficial. Would you like to know more about what therapy might involve?
Yes, the symptoms you're experiencing - feeling bad about yourself, difficulty sleeping, and trouble concentrating - are related to low levels of certain brain chemicals, particularly serotonin. This can cause depression. Medications can help increase the levels of these chemicals, making you feel better relatively quickly, usually within a few weeks. I recommend considering medication as a part of your treatment, alongside therapy.
I understand that you are feeling very sad and isolated right now. It's tough to deal with people making fun of you and not having the support you need.

Can you share one example of a situation where you felt particularly hurt or rejected because of your identity?
It can be very tough to not have a place and feel like you don't belong. Now, let me clarify: you believe that if you weren't gay, your life would be different and you would have friends, correct? On a scale of 1 to 100, how much do you believe that statement? Keep in mind that 100 means you strongly believe it and are willing to take action, and 1 means you don't believe it at all.
It's a bit sad to hear that you're feeling this way, but it's important for you to recognize your feelings. You're carrying a load, but you're also aware of your experiences, which can be considered strengths. If we continue to work together, we can focus on discussing your feelings, thoughts, and body sensations to help you have new experiences. I'd enjoy working with you if you'd like to proceed.
It's great that you're reaching out for support during this difficult time. Feeling down and not having friends can be really challenging.

Can you think of any specific events or situations that triggered these feelings of loneliness and lack of energy?
It must be really tough feeling so isolated and not having anyone to talk to. It can be hard to find the motivation when you're feeling low. Maybe, consider joining an art or music group at school, since you mentioned you're passionate about them? It might help you connect with others who share similar interests, and remember, I'm here to support you as you try to make these changes in your life.
As a counsellor, I truly appreciate your trust in sharing these experiences with me. It's vital to understand that feeling hopeless, alone, and overwhelmed can be a normal response to unhealthy or hateful environments. I hope that in our continued work together, we can build a foundation of trust and mutual understanding to help you find a space where you can be accepted and celebrated for who you are.

Building your self-confidence may help you overcome these feelings of insecurity during tough times.
It's important to recognize that feelings of worthlessness and not being good enough are common, but they don't define your true value. Rather than resorting to reckless behavior for a quick fix, try to find healthier coping mechanisms, such as talking to friends or engaging in activities that make you happy. Could you identify any positive aspects or accomplishments in your life that can help you build a more balanced self-image?
It's a positive step that you've recognized the need to work on yourself and that you're seeking help.

You deserve understanding and support from those around you, and you are a good person who deserves happiness.
It sounds like you're struggling with the fear of being misunderstood and judged by others. Instead of bottling up your emotions, have you considered confiding in someone you trust?

While we can't change what happened, we can work together to help process these emotions so they don't continue to hold you back.
It seems that you are carrying unresolved feelings that manifest as triggers related to endings in relationships or arguments. It is natural for a child to feel responsible for a parent's departure, but it's important to understand that it wasn't your fault. Let's explore these feelings further to identify their root causes and work on developing healthy coping mechanisms. Do you see any patterns in your current relationships that might be connected to your past experiences?
It sounds like you're seeking a better understanding of your mother's departure and trying to avoid repeating her mistakes. It's helpful to gain more insight, but it's essential to remember that you are your own person and can make different choices.

As for dealing with disappointment, it's a normal emotion to experience when receiving criticism, but remember that constructive criticism is meant to help you grow. Focus on learning from it and see it as an opportunity for personal growth. Can you let me know how you’ve used the criticism to improve?
It seems like you are looking for a balance between positive reinforcement and improvement suggestions. You can try expressing it like this: 'I appreciate receiving positive feedback and praises, along with constructive criticism that can help me grow and improve.'
Yes, it's completely normal to feel disappointed when you don't get the praise you hoped for. It's important to recognize that disappointment is a natural reaction and learn to cope with it. Keep in mind that everyone has areas they need to work on, and it's alright to feel disappointed as long as you don't let it negatively impact your self-worth or drive to continue improving.
It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when there are many things to work on. Instead of thinking that something is wrong with you, try to focus on breaking down each task and prioritizing them. For your paper, communicate with your instructor about your situation and request an extension if possible. Remember, it's okay to seek help and ask for support during challenging times.
I understand that receiving mixed feedback can be overwhelming, especially when you've worked hard on your draft. It's normal to feel a bit overwhelmed. Remember that feedback is an opportunity for growth and improvement. Can you identify one or two specific areas from the feedback that you can focus on improving right now?

It's great to remind yourself of their supportiveness in the past, as it can help alleviate any stress or worry you might have about their reaction. Would you like any guidance on how to approach this conversation?
It seems like you are facing anxiety due to the fear of overburdening your supervisor with your requests for feedback. It's important to remember that seeking feedback is a normal part of the learning and growth process.

However, if you're still worried, you can consider discussing your concerns with your supervisor to clarify your doubts and find ways to alleviate this anxiety.
It sounds like you are in a one-on-one meeting with your coach in her office. Can you describe what you are feeling in this situation and if there's any specific concern or topic you'd like to discuss with her?
It's natural to feel disappointed when receiving a lot of feedback, but it's important to remember that feedback is meant for growth and improvement. I encourage you to reach out to your teacher and have a conversation about the feedback. It might help you understand her perspective better and clarify any doubts you have. Is there something specific in the feedback that you're struggling with?
It sounds like you have a fear of being perceived as not good enough, even though your mentor has been receptive and understanding. It's important to remind yourself that her feedback is not necessarily reflective of your self-worth. Having an open conversation about your fears and concerns with your mentor might help in reducing your anxiety and gaining a clearer understanding of her intentions behind the feedback.
It's great that you're open to discussing your concerns with your advisor even though you're feeling nervous. This week, try closing your eyes and visualizing what it would be like to have that conversation, answering any questions that come up along the way. This may help prepare you for the actual discussion.
It's normal to feel nervous when discussing feedback with someone in a higher position. I recommend taking a deep breath and considering the specific points you want to address. Prepare yourself by practicing the conversation and focusing on the constructive feedback you've received. Remember, your advisor's main objective is to help you improve, so view this as an opportunity for growth. If you'd like, I can guide you through some techniques to help you feel more confident during the conversation.

Focus on your strengths and abilities, and try not to let the pressure overwhelm you.
I understand that receiving negative feedback can be difficult, especially when it feels harsh. It's important to remember that feedback is meant to help you grow and improve. Were there any specific suggestions they provided on how you could improve your writing and editing skills?
It's understandable that you want positive feedback, but it's important to remember that no one can meet such high standards all the time. Instead of focusing on praise, try to concentrate on learning and improving, and recognize that constructive criticism can also be helpful for your growth. Is there a specific reason why you feel you need to receive praise constantly?
You are right that receiving only praises wouldn't be conducive to personal and academic growth. It's important to have a balance of praise and constructive feedback in order to recognize your strengths and work on areas that need improvement. Remember that no one's work is perfect, and it's okay to have areas that need refinement in your thesis.
It sounds like getting praise for your work is important to you, but it can be tough to come by. How about rephrasing the way you think about it? Instead of feeling like you must get praise, focus on wanting praise, while acknowledging the challenges you encounter in achieving that recognition.
It sounds like you're worried that not doing well in the program would mean that you're not meant to be there, and it's important to you because it's connected to your future goals. It's understandable to have concerns, but it's important to remember that everyone has ups and downs in their journey. Can you think of any instances or experiences that show you are indeed meant to be here?
It's natural to have self-doubts, but remember that this paper is just one aspect of your journey in your chosen profession. Instead of seeing it as validation that you're not good enough, try to view it as a learning experience that can help you grow and improve. What specific aspects of the paper do you feel you're struggling with?
It seems that you have a conflicting belief about your abilities in the program. You've worked hard and achieved well in the program, which shows you're good enough. Yet, you still struggle with a feeling of inadequacy. If you weren't good enough, you probably wouldn't have made it this far. Try to focus on the evidence of your success and let it reinforce your belief in your abilities.
It's important to recognize your achievements and the fact that you've come this far in the program. You mentioned that you've done well in many parts of the program, and that's great! It's normal to have some areas you feel you could improve on, but remember that progress takes time and consistent effort. If there are specific areas that worry you, could you please share more details?
It's great that you were able to see the silver lining in the situation. While it's disappointing to spend money on food that isn't very good, it's important to focus on the positive aspects like quality time with friends and having new experiences. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes in choosing restaurants, and you shouldn't blame yourself for not reading the reviews better before going.
It seems like you are able to be more flexible and accepting in situations where the outcome isn't as serious or doesn't affect your self-worth. In academic situations, you might be putting too much pressure on yourself to succeed, leading to self-blame. It's important to recognize that you can only control so much and that it's okay to accept when things don't go perfectly. Try applying the same mindset you have in fun situations to your academic life, focusing on the process rather than the outcome.
It sounds like you enjoy spending quality time with friends when exploring new places, and you value those experiences. On the other hand, your academic goals may feel different because they are more focused on personal achievements rather than social connections. It's okay to have such differences in your goals; you can try to find a balance and identify ways to incorporate social elements into your academic pursuits if that helps you feel more motivated.
It sounds like you're experiencing changes in your ability to handle certain situations that used to feel easier for you. It's quite normal for our tolerance levels and reactions to change over time.

It's great to hear that you have many positive aspects in your life, like supportive friends and family, and the joy of exploring new places. Your academic accomplishments are also a testament to your hard work and dedication. Remember to cherish these positive experiences and use them as a source of motivation and strength during challenging moments.
It's great to hear that you have hobbies that you enjoy, such as hiking and trying out new restaurants. Engaging in activities you like with friends can contribute positively to your mental well-being. Keep exploring and enjoying these activities, and remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed or need to talk, I'm here to help.
As a counsellor, I'd suggest that it's great that you're open to trying new restaurants and exploring different types of food. To enhance your experience, you could consider looking up reviews or asking for recommendations from friends before going to a new place. Also, you could try to keep track of the restaurants you've enjoyed to revisit them in the future.
I understand that reviews may not always accurately represent your preferences and this can lead to some unfavorable experiences. If you could share what specifically made your last displeasing dining experience bad, I could suggest some ways to avoid such situations in the future or help you cope with the disappointment.
It sounds like you're experiencing significant anxiety regarding your thesis draft deadline.

It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of anxiety, which is causing your body to tense up and flood you with negative thoughts about your work and how your advisor might perceive it. One strategy to help manage these thoughts is to acknowledge them, but then try to push through and continue working. Over time, it may become easier for you to overcome this initial wave of anxiety and negative thoughts.
It seems like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to create a perfect draft and this may be causing you anxiety. It's normal to feel this way, but remember, no paper is perfect from the first draft. It's a work in progress. Can you identify specific areas that you think might be the root cause of this fear of not being good enough?
It's normal to feel some pressure when completing a significant assignment like your final Masters paper. Remember that you've reached this point because of your hard work and abilities. Focus on breaking the task into smaller steps, and try to remind yourself of your past successes. Don't hesitate to reach out for support if needed, like a professor or peer. Is there any specific part of the papermaking you feel more overwhelmed?
It's a good idea to start with the other assignment, as it can help you get into the right mindset for working on your thesis project. Once you're feeling more comfortable and focused, you can transition to revising your thesis project. Just make sure to allocate enough time for both tasks, like aiming for 11 to 12 hours in total.
I understand that starting a thesis can be overwhelming. However, I would really encourage you to just go for it, especially if it's going to be an interesting and fun topic. If you still feel the need to start with something else, that's okay, but I would strongly recommend getting started on the thesis.
Remember, the goal is not just to finish the draft or other assignments, but to enjoy the process. Try incorporating things you love into the process, like going to a new coffee shop and enjoying the atmosphere, music, and good coffee while working on your thesis. Pay attention to the thoughts and feelings that pop up, and take the pressure off yourself a bit. It's okay if you don't finish the draft right away, focus on enjoying the experience.

It's great that you find joy in the process when you're not feeling anxious. To help cope with the anxiety, you can try exploring new places, such as restaurants, coffee shops, or hiking trails, to take breaks and give yourself a change of scenery. This might help alleviate some of the stress and keep you motivated in your writing process.
It's great that you enjoy trying new coffee shops. It might be fun for you to explore new ones that you haven't been to before. Since you like to study in them, consider setting a goal of staying focused on your tasks for the two hours you spend there. This way, you can make the most out of your time and enjoy the atmosphere of the coffee shop.
That's great to hear that you become less anxious once you start focusing. How about we make a plan for you to visit that coffee shop in downtown Fullerton tomorrow? Sometimes trying new places can help you build confidence and overcome anxiety.
Sure, I can help you with that. Based on our conversation, you mentioned 11 AM as the time you want to meet. Does that work for you?
Yes, it's important to continue paying attention to your feelings and thoughts, even if you feel overwhelmed by anxiety. By writing them down, you're providing valuable insights into your emotional reactions that can be further discussed with your counselor. Remember, the goal is to observe these thoughts and feelings as they happen, even if you don't act on them. It's okay to feel anxious, but tracking your emotions will help both you and your counselor navigate through your fears and worries together.

Identifying aspects that bring you joy can help create a more balanced view of yourself.
It's normal to feel that there's always room for growth, but it's important not to let these thoughts overshadow your achievements.

Can you recall any specific situations when this feeling affected your overall perception of yourself?
It sounds like you put a lot of pressure on yourself to meet very high expectations. Can you tell me more about why you feel the need to achieve perfection, and if there are any specific situations or influences that lead to these feelings?
It's interesting that you've had these standards and rules for yourself for such a long time. The source of these rules could be coming from various factors such as upbringing, societal expectations or personal beliefs. It's important to remember that it is okay to be aware of these rules and standards, but also to recognize that it's not necessary to always meet them. Self-compassion and self-understanding is essential for personal growth. Can you think of any specific instances or events that may have contributed to the creation of these standards?
I understand that you have been setting high standards for yourself since middle school, and not achieving near perfection leads to feelings of disappointment and failure. It's important to recognize that it's healthy to want a balanced life in grad school and that working all the time may not be sustainable. Maybe it's time to reevaluate your expectations and find a middle ground where you can still strive for excellence without being too harsh on yourself.
It sounds like you're experiencing imposter syndrome, where you sometimes doubt your achievements and worry about being exposed as a 'fraud'. It's great that you have moments of recognizing your hard work and worthiness. Which areas of your life or accomplishments do you feel most confident in?

If you find that your anxiety persists despite these strategies, consider seeking additional support from a mental health professional.
It's normal to sometimes feel that way, especially if we put a lot of effort into something. It's important to acknowledge the good feedback you received and trust the opinions of those who reviewed it. However, if you still feel there's room for improvement, take this as an opportunity to learn and grow for future projects. What specific aspects do you think could have been better?
It's possible for your paper to be good and still have room for improvement. A good paper doesn't mean it cannot be improved further. It's great that you are open to making it better, so believe in the quality of your work while also working on enhancements.
It's great that you're taking proactive steps to manage your anxiety. As you go through this process, remember to focus on the instances where the person has shown you that they appreciate your company. Writing down a few of these incidents on your reminder cards can be helpful. Try using these cards and positive strategies while you approach them, and observe how that affects your anxiety.
It's great to hear that the visualization exercise has helped you feel a bit less scared. It's natural to feel fear of disappointment or losing someone's support, but discussing potential responses can be helpful in easing those worries. As your counsellor, I'm curious to know if there's anything else you'd like to explore or any additional support you would need from me in this process?

It's great that you're recognizing the need to shift your goal from perfection to learning and focusing on the things that truly matter, like spending time with friends. It's important to remember that nobody is perfect and to be more kind to yourself during this process. Whenever you find yourself having negative thoughts, take a step back and put it into perspective - is the goal of perfection worth jeopardizing your mental wellbeing and relationships with others?
Yes, it makes sense that your focus on getting praises or being perfect may be overshadowing the actual learning process and enjoyment of writing. It's important to remember that your main goal is to learn and grow, not just to receive positive feedback. Try to shift your focus towards the experience and the lessons you can gain from it, rather than just the end result. This way, you can appreciate the process and become a better writer over time. Does this perspective help alleviate some of your worries?
I'm glad you're able to see the value of that perspective now. We can work together to find ways to apply it effectively in managing the stress you're experiencing. Please feel free to share any concerns about implementing this perspective.
I understand that working on a thesis can be stressful. Since you have regular meetings with your advisor and communicate through email, let's focus on transferring some of the perspectives and skills you've learned in other areas of your life to help you through this process. Try setting mini deadlines and milestones to help you stay on track and build confidence. When is your next meeting?
It's understandable that you're concerned about your relationship with your boss. Instead of constantly questioning her emotions, you may want to have an open conversation with her about how you can improve your collaboration.

It's great to hear about the positive qualities you've noticed in your colleague. Reflecting on these positive aspects can help you maintain a strong and supportive relationship with her. Is there a specific situation or concern you're facing with this colleague that's making you worried or uneasy?

If you find it helps with less intense situations, perhaps you could explore other coping techniques to support you during more challenging times, such as deep breathing exercises or seeking support from friends or loved ones.
It seems like you're experiencing some anxiety about your therapist's reactions to working with you. Remember that therapists are there to help and support you throughout your journey. Can you try using the note cards you mentioned to write down your feelings and thoughts as they come up? This might help you recognize and address any negative automatic thoughts you're having and discuss them more easily with your therapist.
It's important to shift your mindset from 'I have to do well' to 'I want to do well'. Remember, it's okay to feel disappointed if you don't do well, but don't view it as a failure. Disappointment is a natural emotion and accepting it can help you grow and learn from the experience.
It's good that you're aware of your stress levels. Since going back to the old way of thinking increases your stress, try focusing on more positive, self-compassionate thoughts instead. Remember, it's important to acknowledge your feelings and take steps to mitigate stress. Can you think of any strategies to cope with this heightened stress in a healthier way?
You can feel it, right? So it seems like changing your language a little bit helps in lowering your distress level. Do you want to try applying this technique to different situations, and see if it helps you feel better in other circumstances as well?

Have you tried discussing your feelings with your parents and expressing why you felt the need to hide your grades from your dad?

Remember, your mother's philosophy still applies in this situation - do the best you can and be honest about your feelings with your advisor. It might help to open up a conversation about your concerns and seek their guidance. They might be more understanding than you expect and can help you find a solution. Is there any specific incident or issue that makes you feel this way?
It's understandable that you'd want positive feedback on your work, as it boosts your confidence and validates your abilities. However, it's important to remember that striving for perfection can be stressful and hinder your growth. Consider focusing on progress and learning from constructive criticism, rather than seeking perfection at all times. What aspects of your work do you feel need improvement to help you grow further?
It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the amount of feedback you received on your draft. It's important to remember that feedback is meant to help you improve your work and can be valuable in the writing process.

Have you considered setting more realistic expectations and giving yourself permission to take breaks without feeling guilty?
It seems that your father's expectations have a strong influence on your self-view and drive to constantly improve. It's important to recognize that it's okay to have areas where we can improve; nobody is perfect in every aspect. Give yourself credit for your achievements, and don't let a single area of improvement overshadow your accomplishments. Additionally, ask yourself if living up to others' expectations is truly what you want or if it's just internalized pressure.
It sounds like you're recognizing the need to change from a mindset of pressure and obligation to a more positive and self-motivated perspective.

As a counsellor, I understand that it can be frustrating dealing with people who seem dismissive or impatient. It's important to remember that everyone has their own way of communicating, and sometimes misinterpretations can happen. Instead of assuming that the person is annoyed with you, try opening up a conversation to clarify any misunderstandings and ensure there is a healthy communication between both parties.
I understand that you're concerned about your friend's feelings and don't want to potentially make the situation worse by asking her directly. It's important to consider other ways to understand your friend's emotions, such as observing her behavior or trying to have open and honest conversations about your relationship. If you still feel unsure, is there someone else in your friend group who you trust and could talk to about your concerns?
It's natural to worry about how others perceive us, especially when we care about their feelings. However, it's important to trust their honesty if they say that they're not annoyed. If you still feel concerned, try asking them if there's anything you can do to be more considerate in conversations or if they need some space.

It might help Iceman to become more self-aware of his behavior and potentially improve their interactions with others. Can you think of a specific situation where Iceman can practice embracing Marshmallow's mellowness and apply it in his life?
It's important to acknowledge both aspects of your personality. Sometimes, we may suppress our softer side to cope with certain situations. Try reflecting on times when you exhibit your marshmallow side and focus on balancing both aspects of your personality.

You can also consider picking a time when everyone is calm and in a good mood to discuss these issues. Remember, it might take time for them to adapt and change their reactions, so be patient and persistent with your efforts.
It seems like you're dealing with a challenging situation with your parents, and you're concerned about their reactions when you express yourself. Since you can't control their response, it could be helpful to focus on your intentions for communication. Remember, expressing your thoughts and feelings is more about you than about their reaction. What if sharing your thoughts was for your benefit rather than aiming for a specific response from them? That way, you can shift the focus away from the pressure and take back control over your emotions.
It sounds like you are experiencing a challenging transition between being dependent on your parents and gaining your own independence.

Even though it may seem overwhelming to write everything down, it might be helpful to focus on writing just a few thoughts or feelings each day.

Give yourself some time after work to release those emotions and see how it works for you.

Between now and our next session, try focusing on something you can do to help yourself feel better, because ultimately, you're the one who has control over your feelings and well-being.
It's important to remember that only you have the power to make decisions for yourself. While others can be persuasive, ultimately you are the one who decides whether to give in to their suggestions or not. Take some time to reflect on your own values and boundaries, and try to stay assertive when faced with persuasions.

It's understandable that you feel upset when people don't respect your boundaries. It's important to set and maintain healthy boundaries to prevent being overwhelmed or feeling disrespected. Remember, it's okay to firmly stand your ground and say no without feeling guilty. Could you give me a specific instance where someone took advantage of you so I can better understand your situation?
Ralph, we've been together for a long time and I can tell when I'm being manipulated. But let's leave this one. It's very important that we understand your rage and your anger. Can you please share more about those feelings?

It's important to recognize and reflect on the choices you've made and the degree of influence others have on those choices. Think about instances where you felt pressured or influenced by others, and identify ways to set boundaries for yourself. Remember, you have the power to decide your actions and control your life. Is there a specific situation where you feel you've been overly influenced by someone else?
I appreciate that you've been respectful during our sessions. It's normal to feel angry when standing up for yourself, but remember that being assertive doesn't mean being aggressive. When you find yourself getting angry, try to take a step back and ask yourself, 'Why am I allowing this situation or person to control my emotions?' Developing that self-awareness can help you respond calmly and assertively, without letting anger take over.
It's understandable that you're feeling unhappy about having to come here once a week for six months. It can be frustrating to not know why we feel or act certain ways.

Can you tell me about a specific situation where this behavior didn't have the payoff you wanted?
It seems like the judge wanted you to reflect on your behavior and make positive changes, which is why he suggested avoiding barrooms. Based on what happened, it's possible that barrooms are triggering environments for you.

As your counsellor, I would suggest you to evaluate the impact of barrooms on your life and whether it's beneficial for you to continue visiting them.
It's important to recognize that your behavior changes in certain situations like going to a bar. It's not necessarily the bar itself causing the trouble, but your behavior in that environment. It might be helpful to ask yourself why you're drawn to these situations, and evaluate if it's worth the potential negative consequences. Also, finding alternative social activities or environments where you can connect with others without compromising your well-being is crucial.
It's great that you focused on asking questions and attended behavior during the initial interview with the patient. In the next phase, it's essential to build trust and rapport with the patient while maintaining your role as an authority figure.

You mentioned not letting things go by, and that can contribute to escalating conflicts. It's great that you are trying to cooperate and help yourself, and I apologize if my questions seem repetitive. Can you think of any specific situations where you could have responded differently to avoid conflicts?
It's important to acknowledge that while you can't control how others behave, you can control your own reactions to their behavior. It's not about taking crap from others, but learning healthy ways to manage your anger and respond to situations without resorting to violence or aggression.

It seems that you are doing your best to attend to the things that are important to you, but there is some struggle in managing the priorities effectively. It might be helpful to discuss more about the concept of balance, and I can provide some guidance in addressing those challenges more effectively. Would you like to explore this area further together?
It is a tough call, but let's just imagine you approach the parents and express your sympathy and concern. How do you think the parents might react? If you're concerned about their response or potentially placing blame on a colleague, consider an alternative way to communicate your feelings without directly addressing the situation. Remember, it's important to maintain a professional relationship with both the parents and your colleagues.
It sounds like setting a dedicated time for thought management could be helpful for you. Try doing a thought record during this time, identify any cognitive distortions, and remind yourself that you don't need to address every thought as it comes. When the thoughts feel urgent, remember that you'll be giving them consideration during your scheduled time. This approach can help you gain more control over your thoughts and reduce their impact on your day-to-day life.
It sounds like you may be experiencing something similar to the 'pink elephants' phenomenon. Instead of trying to forcefully push your worry thoughts away, consider gently postponing them or allowing them to stay in the background. This approach can help prevent the thoughts from intruding more forcefully, and gradually you may find that their presence becomes less disruptive to your daily life.
It seems like you're having difficulties with sleep due to constant worrying and overthinking. One possible approach could be to create a bedtime routine that helps you relax before sleep, such as deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation. Additionally, it might be helpful to set aside a specific time during the day, earlier in the evening, to address and process your worries so they don't interfere with your sleep. Could you think of any specific worries or thoughts that are bothering you the most?
It's good that you're trying different strategies to cope with worry thoughts before sleep. You could also try incorporating exercise into your daily routine, but not too close to sleep time as it could give you too much energy. It might help you relax and sleep better. Do you have any preferred time to exercise during the day?
You might find it helpful to set aside a specific time earlier in the day to work on your thoughts using thought records. This way, when they come up later on, especially while trying to sleep, you may be better equipped to let go of them and postpone further rumination. I recommend trying this strategy to see if it benefits you.
It sounds like you've been through a difficult experience at work with the child's parents, and the lack of closure appears to be contributing to your distress. It's understandable that you would feel anxious about the possibility of seeing them again, since it seems as though they were critical of your actions. As a counsellor, it's important to reflect on the situation and consider how you can best handle any future interactions with the parents. You might also want to explore ways to cope with the anxiety surrounding this situation or seek support from colleagues. Do you believe the event has impacted your confidence in your abilities as a professional?
It's great that you're considering closure as a way to move forward and repair the relationship.

Address any misunderstandings and be open to listening to their perspective as well. Remember, understanding each other is crucial in resolving conflicts and fostering healthier relationships.
It sounds like a very distressing and disturbing experience, and anyone in your situation would feel that way.

May I know if you have tried any coping mechanisms to help with your sleep and thoughts?

It sounds like you are struggling with worry and finding it difficult to focus on yourself. I understand it's tough when you're trying to mask your emotions and pretend to be happy when you're not.

You didn't finish all the forms and had a difficult day yesterday, which is why you almost called me. I understand that you want to talk about that episode and get through it. Let's move right into discussing it so we can address the issue and help you feel better. Tell me what happened.
First, I want to acknowledge that it must have been an incredibly distressing situation for you. However, remember that you were able to catch the issue as it was happening and took the necessary steps to save the child's life. It's natural to feel guilty, but it's important to recognize that the fault lies with the previous nurse, and you were not responsible for their mistake. You cannot predict the outcomes of every situation, and as a healthcare professional, the best you can do is learn from this experience and use it to maintain vigilance in your future practice. It's important to remember that you reacted quickly and professionally, and ultimately did your best to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient.
It sounds like you're experiencing self-doubt and it's affecting various areas of your life, such as work and parenting. When you have the thought of making mistakes or not living up to your standards, it's natural to feel confused and worried. Can you identify any specific situations or triggers that cause these feelings of doubt, so we can explore them further and address the root cause?
It sounds like you're experiencing self-doubt and it's affecting your confidence. I understand how these thoughts can make you feel overwhelmed. Let's focus on the specific mistake you believe you made, as it might be triggering other doubts and reducing your confidence. That way, we can identify the root cause of this issue and work on building up your confidence and helping you handle the doubts.
It's normal to feel guilty and overwhelmed in such situations. Remember that everyone makes mistakes and it's important to learn from them. In what sense did you choose the wrong patient? Identifying the specific issue can help you find ways to prevent it from happening again and cope with your emotions.
I understand that the situation has been overwhelming for you. It's important to acknowledge your efforts in carrying on with your everyday responsibilities. Since you've been reading Dr. Burns' book and learning about distorted thinking, let's try doing a thought record together right now to identify and reframe your thoughts. This can help you feel more in control of your emotions and gain some energy to cope better. Are you willing to try this exercise with me?
It's understandable that you feel sad about the situation, but remember that you made your decision based on the information available to you at that time and prioritized the more critical patient. It's not your fault that the wrong medication was hung. As a professional, it's essential to learn from such experiences but also avoid self-blame. Is there anything you feel could have been done differently in your assessment process or communication with your team to prevent such incidents in future?
It's completely understandable to seek external validation, especially when it's hard to believe in yourself at the moment. You mentioned that you made the right decision, which is a positive step. Remember that trusting your own judgment is essential, but it's also okay to seek reassurance from others when needed. Keep working on building your self-confidence, and with time, you'll be able to trust yourself more.
It's normal to have a bit of doubt, but let's set the goal of reducing the doubt by reminding yourself that you made the right decision. When something like this happens, it's natural to revisit our decisions. You've mentioned that you feel you performed fine, which indicates you're on track. Keep focusing on the positive aspects of your performance, and the doubt will subside over time.
It's great to see that you're aware of your self-criticism and how it can affect your actions. Taking the approach of treating it like a homework assignment is a creative way to manage your self-criticism. In order to maintain this progress, it would be beneficial to work on your self-compassion and confidence as well. Can you identify any specific triggers or situations that increase your self-criticism?
It's great that you recognize and are working to remind yourself of your good judgement in the past and handling your distress by approaching your parents in a professional and compassionate way. Sleep deprivation may improve once you resolve the issue with your family. However, if it persists, you could consider other factors that might be affecting your sleep and explore strategies like creating a relaxing bedtime routine or seeking further professional help.
I understand that your sleep issues have been a long-standing concern and have recently worsened. Can you tell me more about what specifically has changed and if there have been any new stressors or factors contributing to this exacerbation?
I appreciate your thoughtfulness in wanting to have this conversation without causing blame. As a counsellor, I would recommend approaching the situation by expressing your concern and caring, rather than focusing on avoidance. Ensure your conversation is open-ended, allowing the other person to share their thoughts freely. Ultimately, the focus should be on moving forward, especially since the child is doing fine now.
It's important to consider that being compassionate and empathetic towards the family in these situations is vital. You've given great advice to your colleague. Remember to listen, validate their feelings, and show that you genuinely care about their child's well-being. Communication is key, and sometimes just being present and attentive can make a huge difference. It's not always about assigning blame, but rather, offering support and understanding during a difficult time.
It's understandable that you're worried about your decision-making, but it's important to remember that you can't predict the future. You made the best decision you could at the time based on the information you had. It's natural to feel pain and guilt when things don't go as planned, but it doesn't mean you are a bad nurse. Keep in mind that you're expecting yourself to be a reader of the future, which is an unrealistic expectation. Focus on learning from this experience and continue to do your best in your nursing role.
It's important to recognize that feeling the pain of the consequences doesn't necessarily mean you made the wrong decision. It's natural to feel those emotions, but it doesn't negate the fact that you made the right choice. Maintain the distinction between your emotions and your judgement. Remember, it's okay to feel pain or sadness, but don't let it overshadow the logical conclusion that you made the right decision. It may take some practice and time, but believing in your own judgement is key to maintaining confidence.
It's great to hear that you find the approach of gently putting the thoughts on the back burner more manageable. Remember, the goal is not to completely avoid these thoughts but to manage them in a healthier way. Do keep practicing these strategies and let me know how it goes during our next session.

By challenging your assumptions, you'll have a better understanding of how your choices affect both your mental health and your relationship. So, go ahead and give it a try!
It's true that doing things alone may not change Sharon's actions, but it can start to change your perception of doing things alone. Trying this can be a step towards a positive change in your life. Are you willing to give it a try?

It's understandable that doing activities alone for the first time can feel daunting, but it's important to challenge yourself and step out of your comfort zone. If you feel too depressed to go, remember that it's okay to take small steps and perhaps reschedule for another time. However, I would like to know if there's any particular reason why you feel so bothered about doing these activities alone?
I understand your concerns about the time commitment. Let's start with a plan of 10 therapy sessions. We'll evaluate our progress during the 5th and 9th sessions, and if needed, we can make adjustments to the course of therapy. This approach allows us to work on your problems and break them into smaller pieces without the expectation of a lifetime commitment to therapy.
Thank you for sharing your feelings and being open to therapy. We'll focus on breaking your problems into smaller pieces to make them more manageable.

It's great that you're seeking help through therapy. Cognitive therapy is a type of psychotherapy that aims to help individuals identify and change their unhealthy thinking patterns, emotional responses, and behaviors. As you correctly mentioned, cognitive is related to thinking, and that's the focus of this therapy - to help you develop healthier thought processes which can ultimately lead to improved mental wellbeing.
I understand how you feel - it's natural to feel sad, angry, and depressed in this situation. Let's try to look at this systematically, and examine your emotional reactions. Aside from feeling abandoned, are there any other feelings or thoughts that you're experiencing? We can work through this together and explore different perspectives.
It's important to distinguish between the situation and your feelings about it. Your partner going to a conference is a situation, while your feelings of abandonment and thoughts about fairness are separate issues. Let's try to examine each part of this issue separately to better understand your emotions and thoughts around it. Do you have any other thoughts or feelings regarding this situation?
It's understandable that the thought of being left alone can lead to feelings of sadness and depression. Let's try to understand where this thought - 'I'll be left alone' fits in your life.

It's understandable that you're feeling upset, as this is a significant change in your routine and relationship. It's important to recognize that it's okay to feel this way, but also to consider this as an opportunity for growth and independence for both you and your wife. Have you thought about ways to keep yourself busy and engaged during her absence?
It's natural to feel concerned about your wife being away for the first time. It's important to communicate with her and share your feelings. Ask her how she feels about attending conferences and whether she plans to attend more in the future. Open communication can help alleviate concerns and ensure that both of you are on the same page.
It's common for spouses to feel left out when their partner attends events without them. It's great that you came up with the idea to join her at the conference, which can strengthen your connection and give you a chance to spend time together. Have you discussed this with her and how did she respond to the idea?
It sounds like you were looking forward to spending quality time with your wife during the conference but were disappointed by her response. It's important to consider that she might have her own reasons for making separate plans. Perhaps you could discuss your feelings with her, and also ask her about her thoughts and reasons for making those plans?
It's important to recognize the connection between your thoughts and feelings. When you feel down and depressed, try to identify the thoughts behind those feelings. Ask yourself if those thoughts are based on facts or assumptions. If needed, discuss with the person involved to clarify the situation to avoid misunderstandings and improve your emotional well-being.
This seems like a time of pressure and crisis for you. It's important to acknowledge your feelings of abandonment and examine the changes in your relationships. Have you tried discussing your concerns with your family members? Sharing your thoughts and feelings may help them understand your perspective and work together to maintain a healthy connection despite the changes.
It's important to address all the issues you've mentioned, and while 10 sessions might sound like a lot, it's not an indefinite commitment. Remember, therapy is a process, and it takes time to address and understand your concerns properly. It's great that you've already made progress in identifying these problems. Are there any specific worries you have about attending 10 therapy sessions?
It seems that you've stopped engaging in activities you used to enjoy due to your partner's preferences, and this might be affecting your well-being.

Thank you for sharing your feelings about sitting alone in a restaurant and the thoughts you have during those moments. It's normal to feel self-conscious in situations like these. Let's take a step back and look at your thought process, which seems to be causing your depression. We need to replace those negative thoughts with healthier and more rational thoughts. Don't worry, the therapeutic process can take time, but I am confident we can work together to create positive changes in your thought patterns.

Can you tell me more about the situation that has been bothering you?
I understand why you are feeling hurt and frustrated by your husband's and brother's actions. It's not fair for them to hide important information and make disrespectful comments. However, it's essential to remember that you cannot control their actions, only how you react to them. Focus on discussing your feelings with them and asserting your need for honesty and respect. It may also be helpful to explore why they behaved this way and if they're willing to change. Remember, we're here to support you through this process.
It's understandable that you feel hurt by their actions. However, it's important to recognize that you have control over your own feelings and reactions. Instead of allowing their behavior to make you feel depressed and betrayed, try to focus on how you can communicate your concerns with them and establish healthier boundaries in your relationships.
It's great that you are engaging in personal growth through workshops like the one by Albert Ellis. It's common for people to take time to fully integrate new concepts emotionally. I suggest writing down the coping statements that resonate with you, and practice applying them in smaller, manageable situations first. Gradually, you'll build confidence and be able to use them effectively in more triggering situations. Remember, change takes time and effort, so be gentle with yourself as you progress.
It sounds like your mother has a healthy way of handling anger. In order to cope with your anger in a similar way, consider observing her reactions and behaviors during situations that involve anger. Additionally, you may work on practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help manage your ruminative thoughts. Think about what specific qualities your mother has that support her anger management, and work on incorporating those traits into your own responses.
It seems like your mother has developed a way to cope with anger by taking a break when she feels overwhelmed and returning to the situation when both parties are calmer. This strategy prevents her from using her anger to confront your father immediately, leading to a more adaptive way of handling conflicts. Do you have any concerns or questions about her coping mechanism?
It's great that you recognize the difference in your anger compared to your parents and desire change. Our goal can be for you to learn how to manage your anger similar to how your mom does. Does that sound acceptable to you?
It's important to identify the thoughts that cause your anger to escalate into rumination. In order to effectively manage your anger and have a productive conversation with Robert, try to recognize these thoughts when they arise. When you notice this shift, take a step back and refocus on the situation at hand. Ask yourself, what would your mom say in this situation? This can help you keep your anger at a lower level, allowing you to communicate more effectively with Robert.
It's understandable that you would want an apology, but it's important to manage your expectations based on Robert's past actions. Instead of focusing on the need for an apology and getting upset when he doesn't provide one, try to accept the situation and focus on your own well-being. Keep in mind that you cannot control other people's actions, and it's healthier in the long run to let go of the expectation and instead focus on how you can move forward.
It's good to recognize that even though you don't expect an apology, it's still okay to want one. Focusing on the conversation and viewing him as a potential acquaintance might help shift your emotions. It could be a helpful strategy for moving from feeling intensely angry like your dad to being annoyed or irritated, like your mom's model, and deciding how to handle the situation. Would this approach work for you?
It's great that you recognize the need to change your way of thinking. To start, try focusing on your interactions with Robert and identify areas where you can let go of the need to be perfect. As you practice this, you may find it useful to apply the same approach to other situations in your life. Remember, progress is more important than perfection.
I understand that it might be frustrating when people don't apologize for their mistakes, especially when it's significant to you. Lowering your standards is not necessarily the answer, but it's important to acknowledge that you cannot control others' actions or reactions. Focus on finding a balance between your expectations and reality, and practice accepting situations where you might not receive an apology. Remember, it's more about how you cope with the situation rather than changing others.
It seems like you have a strong sense of your standards and values, which is important for maintaining your sense of self. However, it's also important to recognize that not everyone will meet those standards all the time. Instead of trying to change your standards, it might be more realistic to adjust your expectations, accepting that people may not always meet them. This approach can help reduce disappointments and frustrations while still maintaining your core values.
It's important to remember that our upbringing can influence our preferences and desires, but it doesn't mean we're stuck with them. To understand and change your desires, you can try reflecting on why you want certain things and whether they align with your values and goals. Is there a specific aspect of your upbringing that you believe is causing you to struggle with change?
I understand that you feel hurt by your ex-boyfriend's behavior and that you believe an apology could help bring closure. However, it's important to consider that we cannot control other people's actions or feelings. Perhaps focusing on your own healing and growth can provide a sense of peace regardless of whether or not he apologizes. What have you done so far to work on moving forward from this situation?
It seems like the encounter with your ex has significantly impacted your mood and ability to concentrate. It's important to acknowledge your feelings, but also try to limit the time you spend ruminating on the past. Instead, focus on the present moment, and engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax. Remember, healing takes time and it's okay to set boundaries with your ex if needed. If you continue to struggle, consider seeking professional support.
I understand that you're finding it difficult to focus and you're feeling angry without wanting to be. It's important to recognize that emotions can be complicated, and it's not always a conscious choice to feel a certain way. So, tell me more about the situations or triggers that lead to this anger, so we can explore them and work on managing them.
It's great to hear that expressing yourself in a controlled manner felt freeing. It's important to communicate your feelings and set boundaries with others. Do you feel you still have unresolved emotions regarding the past situation?
As a counsellor, I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more in control of your emotions and have noticed a positive change in your interactions with others. It's important to continue practicing healthy communication skills and self-awareness, as it will help you maintain this improved emotional state. Keep focusing on controlling your anger and handling such situations calmly. If you face any difficulty in the future, feel free to reach out for guidance.
It's good that you're considering ways to handle your anger towards Robert and avoid getting riled up. Practicing in a mirror and using imagery are helpful strategies to prepare yourself for the situation. Remember to stay focused on your goal of staying calm and not engaging in a heated conversation. Keep practicing these techniques and feel free to share your progress or any concerns in our next session.
It's normal to feel unresolved with certain relationships, and it's important to find closure. Since anger hasn't been helpful in communicating your wants, try choosing a different approach. You mentioned writing letters – that can be a great way to organize and express your thoughts. Remember to stay honest and open in your communication and focus on a constructive outcome.
It's great that you are thorough and dedicated in your communication. However, it might be more effective to find a balance between being detailed and being concise. Instead of spending a day or two on each letter, consider finding ways to express your thoughts more efficiently. You could also directly discuss the matter with the person if it's feasible, as face-to-face communication can also deliver the intended message effectively. Do you find it challenging to speak your mind directly?
So, what would you want to say to Robert? Just sort of imagine that, sort of, being angry like your mom, you know, that sort of more controlled, you know, you're, you're annoyed, you don't like what's going on, you're not gonna be steamrollered over, so you, you have some feeling there. What would you wanna say in that emotion? Let's suppose I'm Robert. And we meet in the supermarket. And, you've done this imagery piece that we've talked about, and, you know, you've got your anger under control. And I wanna talk. How's work? What's going on? You know, how is so-and-so, and people we know in common? What are you gonna say?
I can see that you're really angry and upset about your ex-boyfriend's actions. Let's focus on this issue and work through your emotions regarding him. Is there a specific event or situation that has triggered this anger in you recently?
It seems like you feel frustrated with your ex-boyfriend for not apologizing for his past actions and for engaging in conversation with you at the supermarket. It's important to remember that you have the right to decide what conversations you engage in, and you can set boundaries with your ex. What are some ways you think you could handle this situation if it happens again?
I understand how feeling condescended upon can negatively impact a relationship. It seems that your ex's attitude and communication style made you feel disrespected and lower in status. Is this the main reason why you decided to break up with him?
It's important to recognize that dwelling on the past isn't helpful for your healing process. Instead of focusing on your ex-partner's wrongdoings, try to consciously tell yourself to stop when those thoughts arise, reminding yourself that it's not beneficial in moving forward. Focus on positive aspects of your life and practice a healthier way of thinking about your past relationship.
It's understandable that you may feel frustrated when things don't seem to work as expected. Instead of trying to change all your bad deeds at once, consider focusing on one small step each day through practice. This week, let's try that approach and see if it helps improve your situation. Remember, change takes time and patience.
You seem to have been practicing a maladaptive response quite frequently, which is affecting your emotional well-being. Instead of focusing on your negative thoughts, try incorporating some positive imagery into your daily routine. Just like you practiced ruminating, practice replacing those negative thoughts with positive ones, and it may help you feel better over time. How do you feel about trying this approach?
It's great that you're open to trying new strategies to manage your anger. As a counsellor, I fully support your decision to practice these new responses during our sessions and daily. Yes, the same strategy could potentially help you with other people you get angry at. It's important to remember that practice can help you get better at implementing new strategies. Just be patient and give yourself time to learn and adapt to new ways of dealing with anger.
Okay. So, let's not work on them next, just, sort of, we'll realize that we're gonna see if we can transfer this to these, other situations. Does this make sense to you as a way of dealing with your anger? You mentioned that you noticed a difference between the first and the last time, which is great progress! What's going to throw you off so you don't do the practicing?
It's interesting that sometimes anger can lead us to engage in activities or conversations we don't want to participate in. In changing the intensity of your anger response, you might be able to think and act more effectively. Next time, consider trying to limit ruminative anger and explore possible actions like setting boundaries and excuses like needing to do something else to avoid a situation that may worsen. How often do you find yourself in such situations and what could be possible triggers?
It seems like you might be passively waiting for others to realize their mistakes and apologize. Although it's understandable to expect others to recognize their mistakes, it's also important to communicate your feelings and boundaries clearly when necessary. Have you considered actively addressing the issue or politely excusing yourself from the situation if it continues to make you uncomfortable?
It's important to express your feelings and let the person know how their actions have affected you. If you feel ready, try addressing the situation and let them know you've been waiting for an apology. This will allow both of you to move forward and can possibly lead to resolution and healing.
It sounds like the cultural differences and your expectations of politeness are causing you frustration and anger. I understand this dynamic can be challenging. We can work on this issue together to help you handle your anger and use it as a model for dealing with other events that trigger your emotions. Additionally, we can explore why you might be attracting low-quality friends and work on improving your choices in relationships.
It's important to recognize the sources of your anger and learn how to cope with those feelings. Since deep breathing hasn't helped, let's focus on other strategies to solve your anger problem. Additionally, setting boundaries and being more selective with who you let into your life can assist in screening out 'low-quality' individuals. What specific situations tend to trigger your anger?
It seems like you're being held prisoner by your anger, because you can't make this person apologize and neither can I. Instead of focusing on their apology, how about we explore different ways for you to cope and find closure, like writing them a letter to express your feelings?
It seems like this incident really impacted you and you believe that an apology is necessary for closure. It's understandable that you didn't address it on the spot if you felt it was inappropriate. However, people sometimes don't realize they've upset someone unless it's brought to their attention. Since you feel so strongly about this, have you considered reaching out to the person to express your feelings and provide them an opportunity to apologize?
It seems like you had expectations for the conversation, and you were disappointed when they weren't met. It's natural for you to feel that way, but it's also important to remember that we can't control other people's actions. In the future, you might want to consider setting boundaries for yourself and leaving the conversation if it doesn't serve your well-being. Is there anything specific you would like advice on?
It sounds like you're struggling with managing your anger when encountering certain people, and it's affecting your daily life. Have you tried any strategies to cope with your anger when you run into them, or are you searching for new ways to better handle these situations?
It sounds like you've been struggling with setting boundaries with Robert and his rude behavior. It's normal to feel angry but remember, you don't have control over other people's actions, only your own reactions. Since you don't want him in your life, consider focusing on yourself and finding healthier ways to handle this situation. Do you have any thoughts on how you can effectively distance yourself from Robert?
It's great to hear that you are working on controlling your emotions and shifting your focus from controlling Robert to controlling yourself. It's normal for the anger to still be present, but it's important to use that anger as a cue to remind yourself that you cannot control him. With more practice and reflection, you will continue to see improvement in managing your anger. How do you feel when you think about the progress you've made?
It's good to hear that rehearsing thoughts has helped you feel calmer. Letting go of the need for an apology can be challenging, but it's a great step toward healing. However, I'm wondering, during those moments when you are with him, how do you manage and deal with your feelings? This can give more insights on how to continue your progress.
It's helpful to recognize that you're getting angry at him for not apologizing and then getting angry at yourself for being angry. By being aware of this and looking at the situation differently, you were able to relax and manage your emotions. Keep practicing this visualization technique to improve your emotional control in similar situations.
It's great to see that you're making progress in managing your anger and adopting a calmer attitude, similar to your mom's. I want you to keep practicing this strategy of accepting situations that are out of your control, instead of getting tense and demanding apologies. Remember, focusing on what you can control will give you a greater sense of control and relieve some of the tension you feel in your shoulders.
It's good that you've shifted your focus on controlling yourself rather than trying to control your partner. Remember, we cannot change others, but we can control how we respond to their behavior. It's natural to worry about your partner's manners, but try to communicate your concerns with him in a healthy and respectful way. If you still feel uncomfortable, consider seeking therapy together or getting support from friends and family.
It sounds like your social anxiety and sleep issues are affecting your personal and professional life. Social withdrawal and decreased productivity can have a snowball effect, contributing to irritability and further reduced effectiveness. Have you considered seeking professional help to address these problems and improve your overall well-being?
It's important to acknowledge that anger isn't improving your situation. Instead of focusing on the wrongdoings of others, consider if it's worth investing your time and effort in being the 'manners police.' Redirect your energy towards more productive and positive aspects of your life, and question whether holding onto this anger is truly beneficial to you.
It's understandable that you might find it difficult to feel neutral around someone who has caused you anger in the past. Try to focus on how you would like to feel the next time you encounter him, perhaps by replacing your current emotions with a more balanced reaction. Remember, it's in your control how you choose to react to situations and people.
It seems like there were unmet expectations in the relationship, possibly due to a communication gap. Instead of projecting your own desires onto your partner's actions, try to understand their perspective and communicate your feelings openly. In future relationships, consider discussing expectations and ways to resolve conflicts in order to avoid similar issues.
I understand you feel hurt by Robert's actions and his lack of apology. It's okay to want an apology and believe you deserve it. However, expecting an apology when he hasn't given one in the past might not be realistic. It's crucial to recognize this pattern and manage your expectations accordingly, so you can better cope with the situation.
It's important to distinguish between your wants and the reality of the situation. It's okay for you to want an apology, but you should also understand that it may not happen. Focus on acknowledging your feelings without letting the expectation of an apology consume you. Now, can you think of any ways you might handle the situation differently if the person doesn't apologize?
It sounds like you're experiencing a buildup of anger based on previous negative experiences. When you encounter a similar situation, it may trigger your memory of past events, leading to an escalation of your anger. To help with this, you could try focusing on the present situation and addressing the issue calmly. Also, practice letting go of past anger by recognizing that holding onto it doesn't help the current situation. Is there anything else that contributes to your anger in these situations?
It sounds like you get yourself stuck in situations where you expect people to behave a certain way and they don't. It is important to acknowledge your feelings but also consider whether it's realistic to expect others to fulfill your desires for apologies or rectification. Try focusing on your own healing and growth rather than expecting them to change. If you could let go of the idea of receiving an apology, how do you think that would change the situation?
It seems like you are expecting an apology from Robert every time you interact with him, which can create disappointment when it doesn't happen. Instead of focusing on the apology, it may help to shift your focus on healing and moving forward from the breakup. What do you think you need, besides an apology, to move forward?
As a counsellor, I understand that unmet expectations can lead to disappointment and hurt. It's essential to communicate your feelings with the person you're having issues with. You may want to consider discussing why their actions have upset you and if an apology would help you feel better. Remember, try to keep an open mind and remember that others may have different perspectives. How has this unmet expectation affected your relationship with them?
You could try talking to them and ask for an apology as it might make you feel better. However, keep in mind that there's no guarantee they will apologize. In case they don't, you need to think about how to cope with that outcome and find other ways to let go of your anger.
It's understandable that you feel upset, but it's important to focus on how you can cope with the situation rather than trying to change his behavior. Instead of waiting for an apology that might not come, let's work together on strategies to help you move on and not spend so much time ruminating over his actions.
It's true that we can't control other people's behaviors, and it's normal to feel frustrated when someone doesn't act the way we expect. However, it's important to consider whether the amount of energy and emotions you've invested in this situation is worth it. Would you rather hold onto this anger or try to let go and focus on more important aspects of your life and well-being?
So maybe we could try some imagery exercises to help you with this. In these exercises, you'd imagine situations where you feel wronged, which may lead to anger. When you start feeling angry, you can then explore what that feeling of anger means to you and how to deal with it. Don't worry, it's quite common for people to feel angry in certain situations, so it's not impossible to work on.
It's great that you are trying to develop new coping mechanisms for dealing with your anger. The clenching of your hand on the chair when you heard the voice indicates that you might still have some work to do in managing your emotional response. What can you do in the future, when you experience similar situations or triggers, to help yourself let go of the anger and find a better way to react?
I understand that you've been busy, but it's important to make some time to read the book as it's going to be a part of the therapy process. I encourage you to at least skim through the forms and main content, as it will help you understand and participate in our sessions more effectively.
Thank you for completing the form. It's important to focus on your own thoughts and feelings during this process. We'll have a chance to discuss and compare the information from both of you later on, but for now, let's stay focused on your individual experience and progress.
As a counsellor, I appreciate your honesty in filling out the questionnaire. It's essential to understand that in any relationship, it takes effort from both partners to create a healthy and balanced dynamic. It's not just about your partner's attitude, but also about what you both can do together to foster a positive environment. Next time, we can discuss this topic in more depth and explore ways you can work together with your partner to create a better understanding and improve your relationship.
No, you know, what right now, umm… I would… it would be best if you didn't do that, we'll… we'll be talking more specifically about that. But I tell you what I would like you to do and reading the book will help tie some of this together too. I'll do an overview of what I mean with the two of you next time.
That's a valid concern, but as a counsellor, I won't be telling you what to do. My goal is to provide you and your partner with a toolset to help you both address these issues and work through them effectively. I'm here to guide and facilitate, but the work will ultimately come from both of you.
It's great that you have a hopeful mindset. Remember, it's important to take it one step at a time and focus on small achievements. I encourage you to talk about your concerns or challenges with someone you trust, and let's work together to find strategies to support your well-being. If there are specific issues that are bothering you, please feel free to share more.
I think it's a good plan to work on gaining independence, and I understand how the conflicting advice you're receiving can be overwhelming. The key here is to think about what you personally want and need, and then prioritize those steps. Consider looking for a mentor or taking time for self-reflection to better understand your own goals and desires for independence.
It can be really confusing when you have multiple opinions on what you should do. It's important to remember that ultimately, the decision is yours. Take some time to evaluate your personal goals and values before you make a decision. What are some steps you can take towards each of these paths, and which one aligns best with your priorities?
Thank you for sharing your feelings. It's great that you've already ruled out moving out of state, which narrows down the decision to either getting a car or a place first. Consider the pros and cons of each option and how they align with your priorities and financial situation. Remember, 'don't move' goes along with getting a car first. Ultimately, the choice is yours, and making the best decision for yourself is a step towards independence.
As a counsellor, I would provide reassurance and ask for more clarification by saying, 'It seems like you're feeling uncertain about something. Could you please explain a bit more about the situation or what's bothering you, so I can better understand and offer some guidance?'
It's normal for thoughts like these to cause anxiety and sadness. You can't stop these thoughts from coming into your head, but once they do, you can question their validity by asking yourself, 'How do I know that's really true? Maybe it's not.' This can help you challenge and manage those thoughts in a healthier way.
I'm glad to hear that you found the technique of listing advantages and disadvantages helpful in making decisions. It's a great tool to use when facing choices, as it provides a clearer perspective on the consequences of each option. Keep practicing this method and let me know if you have any questions or run into any challenges.
Sure, I can help. A helpful strategy could be to put your thoughts down on paper rather than trying to sort them out in your head. That way, you can have a visual representation of the advantages and disadvantages of each option, making it easier to decide. It was a pleasure talking to you, and I hope this advice helps you in your decision-making process.
We don't know for certain whether you'll end up in that room again or not. However, it's likely that someone else lives there now, so it's not very probable that you will end up in that room again.

It's understandable that you feel scared in such situations due to your upbringing. Next time you encounter this kind of situation, try to remind yourself that you can improve the situation. Consider adding elements to your surroundings to make it feel more comfortable and familiar, like bringing some personal items or images that remind you of your family.
It's understandable that the thought of losing your mom is distressing, given her importance in your life and your previous experiences with loss. It's possible that, although you would be devastated at first, you would be able to continue with your life and the grief might lessen over time. Can you think of any reasons why you believe you might not be able to cope or move forward without her?
It's great that you've identified this pattern of negative thoughts affecting your emotions. It's important to remember that when you're feeling depressed, your thoughts may not always be accurate or completely true. As a counsellor, I suggest you take a step back and challenge those thoughts, asking yourself if they are really accurate or just a result of depression. This can help you gain a better understanding of your emotions and feelings.
Absolutely, I can help you figure out the thoughts that are true and need to be addressed, and those that are not true, so you can let them go. First, we need to identify your thoughts, and then we will analyze them for their accuracy. If they turn out to be true, then there's a problem to be solved. However, if they are not true, learning to recognize and challenge these thoughts can help you reduce their impact on your emotions and behavior.
It's natural to worry about losing loved ones, especially parents. However, it's important to focus on the present and not let these thoughts overwhelm you. Instead of dwelling on the inevitability of your mom's passing, try changing your thinking to cherish the moments you have together now. You can also ask yourself, 'How likely is it that I'll lose her soon?' and reflect on her current health to gain perspective on the situation.
It's natural to feel worried about losing someone close to us. However, since you don't have any concrete evidence of this happening soon, it's essential to remind yourself that your fear might be based on your anxiety rather than reality. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship, and if you still feel worried, you can discuss your concerns with the person involved to gain a better understanding.

It's admirable that you look up to your mother and aspire to be a parent like her. However, it's important to acknowledge the differences in your situations.

Comparisons can be helpful, but it's essential to focus on your strengths and accomplishments, as well.

Trust yourself and your decisions.

I understand that losing your mom's financial support can make things more challenging. It's natural to worry about your children in this situation. Have you considered reaching out to other family members or exploring community resources to help with the financial transition?
As a counsellor, I understand how searching for a new home can be challenging, especially with kids involved. Here is a suggestion: Before you go out and look for a new place, try turning it into a game for your kids. Challenge them to find the most positive things about the next place you're going to look at. Make it a competition between the older two kids and encourage them to focus on the positives without comparing it to your grandma's place. This will make the experience more enjoyable, and it will help them adapt better to the changes.
It's understandable that you want to feel secure and independent before experiencing such a loss. One way to reframe your thoughts is to focus on building your independence step by step.

I understand that you're feeling conflicted about the advice from your sisters. It's important to weigh the pros and cons of each option and consider what would work best for your specific situation. Is there any other information or factors that you think would help you make a more informed decision?
I'm glad to hear that you were comfortable with our conversation. Since there is something specific on your mind, I would like to invite you to share it with me. It is important to address any concerns or feelings you have, so feel free to open up about that topic.
As a counsellor, I agree that writing down the advantages and disadvantages can be very helpful. Often, people have these thoughts swimming in their heads, but putting them on paper makes it much easier to process and weigh them effectively. This practice can definitely improve your decision-making process and provide a clearer perspective on your situation.
Thank you for sharing your feelings with me. It's important to recognize when we need help, and I'm glad you're reaching out. Let's work together on finding coping strategies to manage your stress. Can you please tell me a bit more about the specific situations that are causing you to feel overwhelmed?
As the counsellor, I understand that you believe being independent will make things easier for you, while the lack of it will make things harder but not impossible. It's completely normal to have doubts sometimes. Keep in mind that everyone needs help from time to time and that your support system, like your sisters, will be there for you during difficult periods like grieving.
As a counsellor, I understand your concern about losing your mom's support. It's important to recognize the strengths and support within your family and community. You mentioned your sisters, but are there any other close friends or family members who may be able to support you in a similar manner? Additionally, exploring local resources and programs for childcare might help you feel more confident about managing in your mom's absence.
It's understandable to be concerned about losing your mom's support; it's a significant change to navigate. Let's take a moment to consider the three things you rely on her for and whether it would be impossible to get these from others or if it would just be more challenging. For example, regarding babysitting, who else could potentially help you with that if your mom was not available?
It's understandable that finding a babysitter might be challenging, but as you mentioned, it's not impossible. You could consider trading off babysitting duties with friends or neighbors. Additionally, remind yourself that it's important for you to take care of yourself emotionally. Find ways to provide yourself with the emotional support you need in the absence of your mother or others.
It sounds like your mother's mood had a significant impact on your emotions. It's natural to feel sad, scared, and unsure when someone you care about is upset. Try to remember that her emotions might not be about you, but rather her own difficulties. Is there something you can do to offer support or calmly address the situation without escalating it?
It's understandable to feel upset when being criticized, especially by someone close to you like your mom. Living independently can indeed provide a certain level of control over these situations, however, it's also important to consider if there's room for improvement in the current situation, and if communicating your feelings with your mom could help in reducing conflicts. Were there any thoughts that made you feel particularly sad during this interaction?
It sounds like you've gained some new perspective on your mother's feelings and experienced sadness as you empathized with her loss and loneliness. Can you tell me more about what thoughts were connected with feeling scared and unsure in this situation?
It's understandable that you feel scared as you've experienced a significant loss in your life with your dad's passing, and now you're worried about losing someone else who seems different. It's important for you to acknowledge these feelings and understand that they're normal. Is there any specific event or situation that triggered these emotions in you, or is it general fear of losing someone close to you?
It's understandable that you'd feel burdened in your current situation. To alleviate this burden, you could consider focusing on developing the skills needed for a better role and create a plan to work towards achieving it. Do you have any ideas on which skills you'd like to improve?
It's good to hear that you're okay with the number of friends you have, but let's focus on the problems you mentioned. For the housing issue, I may not have much to offer, but we can discuss coping strategies for dealing with your mother's grief. Can you share a specific situation where you find it difficult to cope with your mother's emotions?
I understand that you're facing challenges due to family expectations and trying to balance your own life while also supporting your grieving mother. You can focus on building your own emotional resilience through self-care, exercise, and relaxation techniques. Remember that it's also okay to seek support from friends or other family members. As for dealing with your mom's grief, try to be a good listener and let her open up about her feelings if she wants to, but don't force the conversation. Encourage her to seek professional help if necessary.
I appreciate you wanting to share your concerns with me. Can you please provide more details about the incident or your thoughts, so I can better understand and offer my guidance?
It's important to prioritize your own well-being and that of your children. In regards to your sister, it may be helpful to have a candid conversation with her about your reasons for making this decision. Assert that it's a well-thought-out choice and that other family members, like your mom or siblings, can take up the slack. Ultimately, what matters is finding a balance that works best for you and your family.
It sounds like your sister has handled her responsibilities well despite the challenges she has faced. It's understandable to feel concerned about your mother's lack of effort, especially in comparison to your sister's dedication. Is there a specific area in which your mother's lack of effort has affected your sister or the family? This might help to identify possible solutions or approaches to better support your sister and address the situation.
It's great that you're ready to communicate with your sisters about your decision. Regarding your concern about losing your mom, it's important to focus on building your independence and confidence in yourself. Can you think of any skills or resources you can develop to help you feel more secure in your independence?
Another way to look at this situation could be, 'If I become independent first, it will be easier on me if I lose my mom. However, if I'm not independent first, it's going to be harder, but not necessarily impossible.' Do you agree with this perspective, and do you think it might be helpful to remember?
It's important to remember that while you can't stop thoughts from coming into your head, you can question their validity. When you have thoughts like this, try asking yourself, 'How do I know if this is really true? Maybe it's not as true as it feels right now.' Recall the moments when your mom seemed strong, like when she was criticizing you, and recognize that she might be more capable than you're giving her credit for. This can help alleviate some of your anxiety.
It's important to critically evaluate the thoughts or pictures going through your head when you're feeling anxious or depressed. Consider questioning the accuracy of those thoughts and ask yourself, 'How true are they?'. If the visualizations are bothering you, try to alter them in a positive way, similar to what we've practiced together. Analyzing and modifying your thoughts or images can help you manage your mental state better.
It's great to hear that you've identified the importance of standing firm on your decision and recognizing the advantages of moving. Becoming independent before making significant changes is indeed a wise idea. Do you have any specific concerns or challenges you foresee as you work towards this goal?
It's important not to get too scared or overwhelmed by these thoughts. When they come up, ask yourself 'How true are these thoughts?' This questioning can help you challenge and manage your thoughts in a healthier way.
As a counsellor, I can see that the core belief underlying your feelings might be that you are helpless and inadequate without your mom's support. In order to help you, I would like to know what specific thoughts went through your mind during that situation that made you feel scared and unsure. This will help us identify and address the thoughts that are directly linked to your dysphoric feelings and work on the most important ones.
It sounds like you are feeling scared and worried about losing this person, especially after having experienced the loss of your father. These feelings can be overwhelming, but it's important to remember that you have the strength to cope with them. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts or fears you have around losing this person, and what you think might help you feel more secure in your relationship?
So you have the thought, 'I might not make it.' Do you have an image or a picture in your head of not making it? It's important to explore these thoughts and feelings, as they can help us understand your fears better and find ways to cope with them effectively.
I can understand how your memory problems can be concerning. It's quite possible that your lack of sleep and depression are contributing factors. I'd recommend prioritizing self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. If your problems persist, don't hesitate to seek professional help, as addressing your depression could potentially improve your memory issues as well.
These symptoms that you're experiencing are indicative of depression. It's important for you to know that you have a real illness called depression, and that's why you're having such symptoms. As your depression begins to lift, these symptoms should also get better. Regarding your mom's criticism, try to understand it within the context of your current emotional state and look for supportive resources to help address both the depression and communication with your mom.
It's important to recognize that our thoughts can have a significant impact on our emotions. In this situation, you have the power to change how you feel by reframing your thoughts. If you try to view your mom's words from a different perspective, such as 'she's just blowing off steam', you might find that your emotions shift, and you feel less sad and scared. Consider practicing this technique when similar situations arise.
It's completely normal for people to need support, especially during times of grief. It's great that you have your sisters to lean on during this difficult period. While they might not be able to provide the same support your mom does currently, I believe you all can come together and find other ways to assist each other. Is there anyone else in your life who could potentially help you with tasks like babysitting?
It's normal to feel apprehensive about making significant decisions like moving to a new place. The fact that you want independence and are considering this change is a positive sign. Looking at apartments and gathering information on finances will help you feel better prepared for this step. Remember to take your time and weigh the pros and cons before making a final decision.
It's great that our conversation helped you gain some clarity about your next steps! Your concerns about depression and fears holding you back are valid, and working on addressing those issues can make a big difference. To help you move forward, let's focus on finding solutions to cope with your depression and fears, like building a support network, practicing self-care, and potentially seeking professional assistance if needed. Remember, progress might take time, but you've got a good head on your shoulders and you know what to do.
It's great to see that you're taking steps towards improving your life and seeking independence. It seems like you're stronger than you think you are. But it's okay to feel sad and burdened at times too. Can you share any specific events or thoughts that are making you feel this way?
When you experience thoughts in word form, it can be helpful to respond to them in word form as well, just like how you dealt with the thought of losing your mother. Consider focusing on the strengths and positives in your life to cope with these thoughts.
I understand your concern about feeling criticized and your fear of losing someone. Instead of only trying to change the negative words, you can also try to change the picture itself. For instance, imagine adding something positive, like furniture, to the picture. This could help you feel stronger, more in control, and enable you to move forward in your life. Just one thing though, can you provide an example of such a thought in picture form?
It's great that you're trying to change your mental picture by envisioning a positive environment for yourself and your family. Imagining such a space can help boost your mood and create a sense of comfort. Keep adding more details to that mental image and try to make it as vivid as possible. How do you feel when you picture this room?
It sounds like you are making progress in creating a positive visualization by including important aspects of your life, such as your children and a comforting environment. Remember to focus on these details and continue to build on this image to feel better.
It seems like you have a strong connection to your childhood home in Chicago. This place might hold significant memories and emotions for you. Can you describe how thinking about this house makes you feel and if there are any specific memories that stand out to you?
It seems like being back in that room and looking out the window brings up memories and feelings from your past. It could be a significant moment for self-reflection and identifying your goals and dreams. How do you feel about being in that room now and what does it mean to you?
It seems like your perspective has changed as you've grown older, and it's causing you distress. Can you tell me more about what prompted this change of perspective and why you now believe you might not be able to achieve those dreams?
It sounds like you are experiencing feelings of emptiness and loneliness in your life. The view outside the window might represent a source of hope or connection for you. What is it about going back to that room that you feel would be a step back? Remember, it's important to explore these feelings to better understand what you may need to improve your emotional well-being.
It's important to recognize that recovery and personal growth are not always linear processes. Sometimes, setbacks occur as a natural part of the healing journey. However, instead of viewing these setbacks as a step back, try to consider them as opportunities to learn and grow. Can you share more about the specific activity or thought process that concerns you?
It's completely normal to feel confused about your future. It's good that you can recognize that moving out of state isn't the right decision for you at this point. Now, try to focus on the other options and consider what truly aligns with your personal goals and desires. Don't hesitate to take your time and reflect on your choices as you make a decision.
It seems like you're trying to determine the best order to achieve independence, whether it's acquiring a car or moving out first. It's understandable that the thought of losing your mom before reaching independence can be concerning. Can you share more about your thought process and what you believe would help you achieve independence in the best way?
Another perspective to consider is that if you become independent first, it will be easier for you to handle the loss of your mom. While not being independent might make it harder, it doesn't necessarily mean it would be impossible. It could be helpful to remember this thought and possibly write it down as a reminder.
It's understandable that you're concerned about losing your mom and how your level of independence might impact your ability to cope. It's great that you recognize that it will be harder, but not impossible, if you're not as independent as you'd like to be. This shows resilience and adaptability. Can you identify any specific areas where you feel you need to become more independent, so you can work on them and feel more confident in your ability to handle difficult situations?
It's understandable that the thought of losing someone you care about is frightening. Losing support can be challenging, but it's important to remember that you have the ability to overcome difficulties and adapt to new situations. Try thinking about other sources of support and how you can build your resilience. Can you think of someone else who might be able to support you, or an activity that can help you feel stronger?
It's understandable that the uncertainty of your future without your loved one can be unsettling. Change may be an inevitable part of life, but that doesn't mean it's easy to accept. Let's explore what specific fears or worries you might have about your future, so we can better understand and address them. Can you tell me about any specific situations or locations you've imagined yourself in that make you feel uneasy?
I understand that you don't have a clear vision of where you are, but you feel unhappy and are struggling to cope. You're drawn towards going back to Chicago, your hometown, even though you don't want to move back there. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling this way or if there's a particular event that triggered these feelings?
It's understandable that you would feel scared if you have that kind of image from your past. When your mom criticized you, it might have triggered those feelings and made you think of being back where you grew up. It's important to recognize these thoughts and emotions and work on building your coping skills. What do you think made this specific event with your mom bring up those feelings so intensely?
It's great to hear that you felt good about yourself while reading in first grade, and that you had engaging activities like scavenger hunts and reading thick books. Your eyes kind of smile now remembering those moments, which is wonderful. It shows how important and positive that experience was for you back then.
It seems like you've been having ups and downs with your learning experience. It's great that you sometimes feel accomplished when you finally understand something. When you're feeling upset or frustrated, it might be helpful to take a break and come back to it later, as you've mentioned. This can give you a fresh perspective and may help reduce stress. It's also important to remember that learning is a process, and it's okay to experience difficulties along the way.
It's impressive that you learned to read at such an early age and were motivated by seeing your family members reading. It must have been a great sense of accomplishment when you were able to read like your older siblings. Regarding the disparity between your reading and math abilities, it's essential not to disregard any subject entirely. Instead, focus on improving the areas where you struggle, like math, which will help you become a well-rounded individual. Can you think of any specific reasons why you didn't care about math?
It sounds like that memory of reading with your Aunt Telmecida is a really special and vivid one. That must have been a significant moment for you when you realized that you could read.

Do you notice any particular situations where patience makes a significant difference in your problem-solving approach?
It's great that you can be patient in reading and helping others, as it shows your empathetic nature. Since you're already applying patience in other areas, try using the same approach in math.

It's understandable that talking about your feelings might feel weird, especially if it's something you're not used to doing. It's great that you're finding a healthier outlet like going to the gym, but remember that it's also important to address and process your emotions, rather than avoiding them altogether. If you give yourself the space to share and discuss, you may find it becomes easier and more helpful over time.
It's great that you're finding new activities and ways to keep yourself busy, but I sense some fear or concern in your actions. Can you tell me more about why you're avoiding this person and if there have been any specific incidents that caused these feelings?
I understand it can feel a bit strange to be in a counselling session where you do most of the talking.

Unlike typical conversations with friends or family members, counselling focuses on providing you with a space to openly discuss your problems, and I am here to listen and support you throughout this process.
Yes, during my training, I have been prepared to work with different groups, including women.

I understand that you feel uncertain about what will happen next, considering that you don't know much about the person's connections or potential consequences. It's natural to feel this way. The police will typically try to do their best to ensure that any criminal activity is stopped or prevented. It might not be within your control to impact the outcome directly, but you can focus on your own well-being and personal safety during this time. Trust the authorities to do their job in handling the situation.

In the future, you may want to improve your relationships, but for now, focus on meeting others where they're at and considering when to take a step back. We can continue working through this journey together in our future sessions.
As a counsellor, I understand how difficult it can be to find effective coping mechanisms. It's great that you have a strong social support system in place.

I understand that this situation can be difficult for you. It's important for your partner to acknowledge and respect your identity for a healthy relationship.

Could you please elaborate on what specific aspects of your experiences you would like me to focus on?
I understand how important trust is in a therapeutic relationship, and having a therapist who shares your queer identity can definitely help foster that trust.

Can you think of any strategies to cope with these feelings when you're outside of your comfortable social circles?

I understand that you're facing a complex decision involving your family and your own well-being. It seems like there are two sides: one is maintaining your relationship with your family while also caring for their feelings, and the other is creating a new life for yourself and your partner, distancing from the hurtful aspects of your family. Since this decision is also related to speaking with your mother about your sexual orientation, would you mind sharing how that conversation might impact your choice?

It might be beneficial to connect with those people and learn more about their experiences with you to gain a broader understanding of your situation.
As a counsellor, I appreciate you sharing the introduction to Externalizing and counter stories. Externalizing helps in separating the problem from the person, which allows exploring the issue without judgment and guilt. Counter stories can be empowering as they challenge the dominant or negative stories about yourself, enabling you to rewrite your narrative positively. It's essential to embrace these techniques and continue discussing them in our sessions. If you have any concerns or areas you want to focus on, feel free to mention them.
It's common for decisions to lead to other choices, and sometimes they can be more challenging. Can you provide a specific example of a decision you made and the subsequent, more difficult decisions that arose from it? This will help us understand and address your concerns better.
It sounds like you have taken a significant step by coming out to your mom and it might have been difficult for you. How did your mom react to the news and how are you handling her reaction?

It seems like punctuality is an important value for you, but it is causing some friction in your relationship with your family. Perhaps we could explore what punctuality means to you and your family, and how it is affecting your relationship. Can you share more about the specific incidents or situations where this difference has caused challenges for you?
It's important to recognize that it's not possible for you to be responsible for every aspect of your life or the lives of others.

Gaining a deeper understanding of the history and progression of the issue will help us determine the most effective strategies to address it.
I understand that you've started to explore the impact of the pain you've been experiencing, but it seems you haven't yet delved deep enough into the issue. As a counsellor, I would encourage you to examine the extent of the pain and its effects on your life more thoroughly.

As a counsellor, I appreciate your recognition that this journey is a process that takes time and can involve multiple decisions. It's alright if you don't want to discuss a particular issue at the moment. We can work together at your pace to address challenges and make decisions as they come along.
It's normal to feel concerned about making decisions that might affect you and your loved ones. However, difficult situations often come with an opportunity for growth and learning. Instead of focusing solely on the pain that may arise, consider the benefits of each option.

Maybe this could also help in re-establishing communication with your mom and work towards understanding and acceptance within the family.
I understand that you're going through a tough time. It's natural to feel lost or confused when our understanding of someone close, like your mom, changes unexpectedly. Can you tell me what specifically happened that made you question your understanding of your mom? This may help us explore your feelings and find a way to cope with this new information.
Externalizing is a technique used in narrative counseling, largely developed by Michael Wordsworth and David Thexton. It involves separating the problem or issue from the person, treating it as a separate entity, and shifting focus away from internal causes. This allows the individuals to explore their relationship with the problem, gain new perspectives, and ultimately, find ways to resist its influence or overcome it. Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions about how it was applied in your conversation with Donna.
It's important to recognize the distinction between you and the habit, acknowledging that the habit is an external influence rather than something residing inside you.

It sounds like you're experiencing a problem that has been impacting your life in various ways for an extended period. As a counsellor, my goal is to help you externalize this problem, so instead of believing that there's something wrong with you, we'll work together to explore the issue as an outside influence. Let's begin by discussing the main areas of your life where you feel this problem has exerted its influence and the specific situations that led you to believe something was wrong.
It sounds like you have been mentally organizing your thoughts using key words, such as length, breadth, and depth. This might be helpful in categorizing and structuring your thoughts. Can you please elaborate more on the context around these words and how they help you handle your thought process?

Let's work together to identify what brings you down and what lifts you up, so that we can find ways to manage those feelings when they arise.
It's understandable that it would be challenging to shift your perspective on your father's actions. It's possible that his decision had more to do with his own issues than with not wanting to be with you. As we work together, we'll explore ways to tackle the belief that you're not the kind of person people want to be with, and help you learn to find happiness within yourself. Remember, it's a process, and you're already showing courage by discussing this openly.

In the next session, you can reintroduce the invitation and once your client brings it up again, take the opportunity to decline the offer and explain your reasons for doing so in order to maintain the professional relationship. You could then ask your client what they hope to achieve from that dinner and try to understand the bigger picture behind their invitation. If they struggle to express themselves, you can remind them of the issues they've faced in previous relationships and how you've worked together to overcome those.
It's important to maintain ethical boundaries in a counseling relationship, and it's great that you're aware of that. One suggestion would be to discuss your concerns with a supervisor or colleague to identify any unintentional boundary crossings. Additionally, you could set clear expectations and boundaries with your client and ensure they understand the professional relationship. Let's discuss the scenarios further to help you address this issue more effectively.
From your description, it seems that you are being mindful of maintaining professional boundaries and prioritizing ethics in your work. Accepting the flowers and placing them in the waiting room for everyone to enjoy was a thoughtful way to handle the situation, as it shows that you value your client's gesture but also ensures that you're not fostering a personal relationship outside of the professional context. Continue to be aware of these ethical considerations and don't hesitate to seek guidance if you have concerns in the future.
It's good to hear that things have been going well overall.

It sounds like your patient is feeling more comfortable with you, but it's important to maintain a professional boundary in therapy sessions. The feelings of awkwardness and defensiveness you're experiencing are valid. In the next session, it's crucial to set clear boundaries and kindly remind your patient about the importance of staying focused on the therapeutic process. Make sure to address the change in their demeanor and ask if there's anything specific they would like to discuss related to their progress in therapy.
It's important to consider both ethical guidelines and cultural factors when it comes to accepting gifts from patients. Since you have already accepted the flowers, one approach to handle the situation now would be to have a conversation with the patient about the meaning behind the gift and explain to them that it's not necessary to give gifts to express gratitude. This will not only help you understand their intentions but will also establish boundaries and clarify expectations moving forward.
It seems like the situation has become uncomfortable for you. In these cases, it's important to establish professional boundaries and communicate them clearly to the client. You can explain to him that as a professional, you need to maintain a certain distance and that you cannot engage in personal relationships outside of your professional role. If he continues to cross boundaries, it might be necessary to discuss this with your supervisor or consider referring the client to another professional.
From your description, it seems like you might be projecting your desire for a new relationship onto our interactions. To better understand your intentions behind this offer, I'd like to ask you: What are you looking for when you think about inviting me out and what would you like in the bigger picture for your life, perhaps in terms of companionship or personal growth? Reflecting on this might help us stay focused on the goal of our counseling sessions.
It sounds like you maintained your professional boundaries while still being respectful and appreciative of the client's gesture. You can consider clarifying your response by stating your appreciation for the friendly gesture, but reminding them of the importance of maintaining a professional relationship in such situations.

Can you please tell me why attending a client's social event might be considered inappropriate?
It's important to set boundaries in the professional relationship between client and counselor. Your concern about maintaining the professional relationship is valid. Instead of worrying about sounding harsh, be clear and assertive about your role as a counselor. You can express your appreciation for the trust and rapport you've built, but emphasize the importance of focusing on the therapy goals and keeping the relationship professional. You might ask your client: 'How do you think our working relationship would be affected if we were to become more than client and counselor?' This can help your client understand the importance of boundaries.
It's completely normal to feel a bit uncomfortable or silly when opening up about personal matters.

It sounds like the situation of facing two reporting managers brought up feelings of insecurity and worry about doing something wrong, similar to a past experience in school.

Can you think of any specific actions or behaviors that might have triggered these feelings?
I understand that feeling targeted can be frustrating and isolating. It might be helpful to gather more information on the situation. Do you think you could find out if others in the organization have experienced similar treatment or if there's a specific reason for their actions towards you?
It's great that you're recognizing the impact of your childhood beliefs and understanding that you can change them.

I'm glad to hear that you've found value in the therapy and learned something about yourself. It's great that you see potential for growth, both in presentations and in sharing your feelings. Remember that self-improvement is a continuous process and keep building on what you've learned.

That's a valuable realization! It's important to question our perceptions and thoughts, as they can sometimes be influenced by our emotions or past experiences. This can help us develop a more balanced perspective on ourselves and the situations we encounter. Do you have any examples where you applied this understanding?
I'm glad that you're examining the evidence for your beliefs.

It's important to recognize the need for feedback in our sessions. My goal is to provide honest feedback to help you in your growth. Keep in mind that our work together will involve discussing your thoughts and feelings, and I will always try to give you genuine feedback. Is there any specific area where you'd like more feedback?
I understand your concern, but as your therapist, I'm committed to being honest with you. I've also watched the tape and genuinely believe you didn't sound silly or look weird. My role is to support you and provide honest feedback, so you can trust that I'm being sincere when I give you compliments.
It sounds like you're experiencing intrusive thoughts, which can be distressing. Is there a specific situation or thought that triggers these critical voices? Understanding the possible triggers might help in finding ways to cope with them and reduce their impact on your well-being.
It's interesting how you've developed this belief, expecting people to be antagonistic towards you. This might be a protective coping strategy which could have helped you in the past. But are there times when this expectation might hold you back from forming genuine connections with others, or seeking support?
I understand how you're feeling. It seems that you have some negative core beliefs and a history that affects your current situation. One thing we can do is develop a conceptualization to better understand these beliefs and their origins. If your history were different, maybe a few people not paying attention to you wouldn't bother you so much. Over time, we'll work on addressing these beliefs to help improve your overall well-being.
I understand that feeling ignored or dismissed can be discouraging. I'd like to help you explore why you might feel this way and work on strategies to improve communication and connection with others. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you felt people were not paying attention to what you had to say?
It's natural to feel intimidated when comparing yourself to others, especially in a work environment. However, it's important not to solely focus on negative thoughts. Keep in mind that different people have different strengths, and a boring presentation can also affect audience engagement. Remember the concept of cognitive therapy we discussed earlier? Focus on your own strengths, and try to improve your presentation skills. It might also help to ask your colleagues for feedback. Do you have any specific areas you'd like to improve?
It seems you are concerned about not being heard and the idea of others being bored with you. Can you share a specific situation where you felt this way, so we can better understand and provide guidance?
It's important to remember that intelligence is multifaceted and being a doctor doesn't make someone better at everything. Comparing ourselves to others can be detrimental to our self-esteem. Focus on your strengths and understand that everyone has different talents. If you still feel worried, could you provide a specific example of when you felt inadequate compared to your colleagues?
It's true that being clever does not automatically make someone an interesting speaker. However, it's important to recognize that effective communication and engaging others are skills that can be learned and developed. As a counsellor, I would suggest focusing on honing your speaking skills, sharing your knowledge in a relatable manner, and learning how to read your audience's cues to adjust your presentation accordingly. Remember, being both clever and engaging is not mutually exclusive – you can definitely achieve both!
It's natural to compare ourselves to others, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique set of talents and abilities. Instead of focusing on what others can do, try to focus on your own strengths and accomplishments. If you find that you are struggling in a particular area, remember that it's never too late to learn new skills or improve on existing ones. Keep in mind that self-confidence and self-acceptance play a big role in our overall well-being, so work on cultivating those qualities within yourself. Do you find that any particular event or situation triggers these feelings of inadequacy for you?
It's important to consider alternative perspectives in these situations. Instead of assuming people don't like you, maybe they are showing consideration for you by not imposing their dislikes. Let's explore more evidence that supports or contradicts this idea; we can also look for any positive indications that they do like you. Remember, our thoughts can greatly affect our emotions and well-being, so it's crucial to challenge negative beliefs.
It's great that you have a close relationship with your immediate neighbors and enjoy playing cards with them. It's completely normal to feel more comfortable around familiar faces. If you're looking to expand your social circle, it could be helpful to try participating in activities with a smaller group of people and gradually broaden your comfort zone.
It's understandable that you would prefer smaller groups, as it can be easier to connect and have better access to each other. However, it's also natural for some people to feel left out in larger groups. Can you think of any specific reasons why you might feel more left out than others, besides the assumption that people don't like you?
It's common for people to feel anxious about starting conversations, and it's important to remember that everyone is different in their approach. To make it easier, try finding common ground or interests to initiate the discussion. Also, practice and experience can help build confidence in social situations. What specific situations are you most concerned about?
It sounds like you had a challenging experience presenting, especially when you weren't feeling well and were unfamiliar with the technology. It is natural to feel embarrassed in such situations. However, it's important to remember that not every audience will be interested in every topic, and their reactions might not be a reflection of your capabilities. If you were to give a presentation in the future, would you like some guidance on ways to improve your confidence and handle distractions?
I'm sorry to hear that you were unwell during your presentation, it must have been challenging. What did you see in the room at that time? Try to focus on the surroundings and the atmosphere, as it can help lead us to a better understanding of how it impacted your experience.

It seems like you felt a sense of isolation within that group of people at school. It's normal to feel that way when it appears others have formed connections and you might not completely fit in with their interests. It's important to remember that people have a variety of interests and characteristics, and you don't need to be just like others to find your own group of friends. Did the feeling of isolation affect your interaction with these individuals or your overall experience at school?
It's natural to feel different and not fit in with certain groups, and it doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. It might be valuable to explore your interests and find like-minded people so you feel more connected. Can you think of any activities or interests that you genuinely enjoy?
It seems like you were trying to find your identity and a sense of belonging. It's normal to seek acceptance from others, but it's also important to be true to yourself. Remember, you cannot please everyone all the time. Focus on fostering genuine connections with people who appreciate you for who you are. Sometimes people may not like us, but that's okay. Learn to be comfortable with that and be proud of who you are. Is there any specific situation that made you feel this way?
It's great to hear that your therapy has been helpful thus far. As you move and face new challenges, it's important to remember that life has its ups and downs. When you encounter a difficult situation, try not to see it as a failure or setback, but rather as an opportunity to apply your newly acquired skills. Since you'll be entering a new environment, expect to be tested and be prepared to face these challenges head-on. Be proactive and think about how you're going to handle these situations, using the coping strategies you've learned in therapy.
Thank you for sharing your feelings. It's understandable that inconsistent support can be confusing and overwhelming. From what you've shared, it seems like a visual representation, such as a timeline of events, might help you gain more clarity. You can start by writing down instances where you felt supported or unsupported, and over time, you might be able to identify possible patterns or triggers. How does that idea sound to you?
As a counsellor, I would suggest you to share your experience with the people around you, let them know how your work has been affecting you lately. They might not have noticed the difference, but opening up with them can improve communication and mutual understanding. This way, you can also get support and encouragement from them.
It's completely normal to feel drained at times, especially after a busy week. It's important to listen to your body and give yourself the rest and relaxation it needs to recharge.

If you ever want to discuss your feelings or concerns further, know that I am here to listen and help.

It must have been a difficult experience for you, especially having to spend the rest of the time with them, despite their actions. It's great that the French teacher's husband noticed your absence and came to find you. How have you handled similar situations since then, if they have happened?
I understand that you feel left out and excluded during dinner parties. Sometimes, people may not realize that they're unintentionally leaving someone out. If you're comfortable, you can try to initiate conversations yourself or join in on discussions. Additionally, regarding your concern about not being greeted with an 'mma,' could you provide more context or details on what 'mma' means and why it's important to you?
It's possible that there could be various reasons for this change in your friend's behavior. One option is to reach out and initiate a conversation with Linda, asking her if everything is alright and if there's any specific reason why she hasn’t been coming for coffee lately. This way, you can have a better understanding of the situation and hopefully reconnect with your friend.
I understand that increased workloads can sometimes lead to stress and affect our well-being. It's essential to find a balance between work and personal life. Consider taking breaks during work, engaging in activities that help you relax, and maintaining open communication with your supervisor if needed. It's also a good idea to prioritize self-care during this time by maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly and ensuring adequate sleep. Remember, it's important to reach out for support when needed.
It's important to consider various factors that could be influencing your coworkers' behavior, as it might not necessarily be due to them disliking you. Have there been any changes in your work dynamics or other external factors that may have led to this observed change?
I can understand why you would feel left out in this situation. Perhaps there was a miscommunication or a different method of invitation used for you? It might be helpful to express your concerns to the event organizers and ask for any possible explanations. This way, you can gain clarity on the situation and avoid feeling excluded in the future.
It's common for people to feel pressured in this type of situation. Someone else experiencing the same thing might also feel embarrassed, nervous, or even angry. It's important to remember that these feelings are not uncommon and it's okay to feel this way. Do you want to talk about any strategies to cope with these emotions?
It's completely understandable that you're feeling angry and anxious due to your thoughts. It's true that our thoughts have a significant impact on our emotions. It's important to remember that everyone's experience and threshold for feeling good or safe is different. It may be helpful to focus on your behavior and actions that you can control to cope with these feelings. Can you tell me about any coping strategies that you've tried so far?
It's normal to feel exposed and want to escape from uncomfortable situations. The fact that you hurried up might make people notice, but most of them will not judge you for it. To cope with this anxiety, you can practice deep breathing exercises and focus on the present moment. Try not to overthink about how others may perceive you. Is there a specific reason why you feel so exposed and concerned about people's opinions?
It sounds like you felt uncomfortable when you noticed people shifting in their seats during your presentation and that you were rushing it. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind at that moment and how it affected your performance?
It's understandable to have concerns about how we compare to others, but it's important to remember that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, whether or not you're perceived as 'clever' doesn't necessarily determine your ability to engage others. Can you think of any specific instances where you felt this way, and what happened during those situations? This information can help us better understand and address your concerns.
Firstly, it's important to remember that during presentations, not everyone will always be fully attentive. People can get easily distracted for various reasons. However, it's essential to focus on the majority of the audience who were engaged and listening to you. It's natural to feel anxious when presenting, but try not to let the few inattentive people affect your confidence. Would you like to discuss any specific concerns regarding your presentation?
As a counsellor, I understand that you're feeling concerned about those few important people who didn't seem to be engaged. It's quite natural to seek validation from others, especially key individuals. However, try to focus on the fact that a majority of the people in the room were indeed paying attention to you. You might also want to explore why you perceive these particular individuals as important and how that impacts your self-worth.
It seems like the trigger for your anxiety is people's disengagement during your presentation, leading to negative thoughts about yourself. One approach we could take to cope with this anxiety is to explore and challenge these negative thoughts. Additionally, developing strategies for maintaining focus and confidence in your presentation could also be helpful. Is there any specific instance or presentation that this anxiety impacts more than others or do you feel it is a general concern in all kinds of presentations?
It's normal to sometimes compare ourselves to others and feel inadequate. However, it's essential to recognize that everyone has unique strengths, and comparing ourselves to others isn't always helpful. You shouldn't feel like a fool for not being 'as clever' as you perceive others to be. Instead, try to focus on your own skills and accomplishments, and be compassionate to yourself. If this is an ongoing issue for you, can you share any specific situations or triggers that make you feel this way?
As a counsellor, I understand your concerns about feeling nervous during presentations. It's completely natural to compare ourselves to others, like your coworker Sheila, but we need to focus on improving our skill set and finding ways to grow. You can learn and practice techniques to manage your nerves and boost your confidence during presentations. Remember, it's not about trying to be exactly like someone else but improving yourself and your abilities. Let's explore some strategies to help you become more comfortable in front of groups. Can you share a specific situation where you felt most nervous while presenting?
As a counsellor, I understand why you might feel that way. Let's consider the evidence supporting your negative thoughts about your friends not liking you. Could there be an alternative explanation for them meeting without inviting you? Maybe it was an oversight, or the gathering was related to a specific topic you're not involved in. It's important to remember that there could be other reasons outside of them not liking you.
It's understandable that you might feel left out and concerned about these events. It's good that you're recognizing your feelings as you write things down. It might be helpful to talk to those people and ask them about their intentions, but also remember to be open to their perspective. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or add before we proceed?
I understand that timing in conversations can be challenging, especially when trying to make a meaningful contribution. It's important not to put too much pressure on yourself to be entertaining or funny. Instead, try focusing on being present and engaged in the conversation, and allow your natural responses to flow without overthinking them. Remember that people appreciate genuine connection more than a perfect comment. If you still struggle, you could practice your conversational skills in a low-stakes environment or even consider joining a group or workshop specifically designed to help you improve your communication skills.
It seems that your work has had a significant impact on how you participate in conversations, especially when they're fast-paced. It's natural to feel worried and tired, but it's important to acknowledge these feelings and find ways to manage them. Can you think of any strategies you can apply to improve your communication and cope with the stress from work?

Do you feel comfortable sharing any other details about this situation or how it has affected you?
It's quite possible that your past experiences with your parents' help might have shaped your current mindset. Sometimes, even with good intentions, the help we receive could feel unhelpful or intrusive, which may lead to a reluctance to accept help in the future. It's important to recognize this pattern and work on building trust in others' ability to provide support. Would you like to explore more examples from your past or discuss strategies for addressing this issue moving forward?
It's natural to feel concerned about maintaining your progress after therapy. In Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), we emphasize the importance of developing 'takeaway materials' that you can use during and after therapy. These materials are designed to help you integrate the lessons and techniques you've learned into your daily life and maintain your gains in the long term. I encourage you to utilize these tools and continue practicing the skills that have helped you make progress so far.
It's great that you're recognizing that some people have indeed helped you in the past. It is important to remember that not everyone will be able or willing to help, but there will always be others who are willing to support and assist you when needed. Try to focus on the positive experiences and interactions, and remind yourself that you are deserving of help and support, just like anyone else.
It's great to hear that you're recognizing your own self-worth and the potential you have to help others. Remember, no one is perfect and everyone has their unique strengths and weaknesses. Embrace your individuality and continue to focus on the positive aspects of yourself. This mindset will not only benefit you, but also those you help. Keep this perspective in mind as you continue your journey of self-growth.
It's great to hear that you are considering starting a positive log. This can be an effective tool in combating negative thoughts and reinforcing the belief that there are people who care about you.

Remember, you can always reach out to your support network when you need help, and reviewing your log regularly will remind you of the people in your life who are there for you.
It's important to recognize double standards and work towards resolving them. However, it's also essential not to be too hard on yourself. Remember that growth is a process, and it's okay to feel self-critical, but try not to dwell on it for too long. Allow yourself space to improve and learn from these experiences. Is there a specific incident that made you feel this way?
It's great that you're aware of your empathy towards others. My suggestion would be to try extending that empathy towards yourself as well. This might help you find a balance between being understanding with others and also being kinder to yourself, which could lead to better overall wellbeing.
It's important to remember that these sessions are meant to help you, and sharing your struggles is a crucial part of the process. As for not looking good in the video, remember that our self-perception can often be critical and may not reflect how others see us. Is there a specific reason why you feel sharing more about yourself might prevent you from coming to the sessions?
It's natural to feel that our loved ones' opinions might be biased, especially if it involves a situation concerning us. It's important to consider multiple perspectives and communicate openly with your husband about your concerns. You can also seek advice from a third party, like a trusted friend or a professional, to gain more insights and make informed decisions.
It sounds like you might feel undeserving of kindness or have some self-confidence issues, causing you to feel embarrassed when people are nice to you.

It's interesting that you hold yourself to different standards than others when it comes to seeking help. Remember, it's okay to ask for support when needed.

It's important to acknowledge and appreciate the support that you have received from others in your life. While it's true that you can't expect everyone to help you all the time, it's great that you've had some positive influences. It's crucial to focus on those positive experiences and not let negative thoughts overshadow them. Have there been any strategies or tools that helped you cope during the more challenging times, such as the Paris incident you mentioned?
It's understandable that you want to anticipate future problems to some extent, as it can be helpful in certain situations. However, excessive worrying can hinder your ability to enjoy the present and focus on other aspects of your life. It's important to recognize when your worry goes beyond its usefulness, and learn to switch it off when necessary. Consider finding a balance between addressing potential issues and allowing yourself to live in the present moment. Do you have any strategies for managing your worries?
It seems like you feel that your parents didn't provide you with the same level of support and encouragement as they did for your siblings. It might be helpful for us to explore how this lack of support has affected you and if there are any ways you could communicate your feelings to your parents or find alternative sources of support. Do you think the differences in the way your parents treated you and your siblings have had long-term effects on your self-esteem or relationships?
It seems like your parents made the decision based on your sister's experience and what they thought would be best for you. Remember that we cannot control the past, and it's important to focus on the relationship you have with your parents now. How do you feel about your parents' decision now, and have you talked to them about how it has impacted your life?
I can understand how that could have made you feel neglected or overlooked as a child. It sounds like your parents were dealing with significant challenges with your siblings, and it may have been difficult for them to provide adequate attention and care to everyone. How do you think this has affected your relationships and self-esteem in your current life?
It sounds like this unexpected situation made you feel vulnerable and pressured to perform, stirring up your core belief that people aren't supportive. It's natural for certain situations to trigger these feelings, but it's important to remind ourselves that not all people are the same, and some might be genuinely interested in helping you. If you encounter similar situations in the future, would differently knowing about the other person's presence beforehand make you feel more at ease?
It sounds like you experienced anxiety and some physical symptoms related to that. Since these feelings are similar to when you do a presentation, it could be a sign of performance anxiety. In order to help you manage these emotions, can you share any strategies you've used before to deal with your anxiety during presentations?
As the counsellor, I understand that the issue you're experiencing seems to be quite significant and pervasive. It's not uncommon for therapists to recognize such concerns as well. Can you please elaborate on the specific issue you're dealing with, so I can better assist you and provide appropriate guidance?
I understand that you and your partner are having conflicts over small disagreements. It seems that both of you are getting into a competitive mindset where it becomes more about winning the argument rather than understanding each other's perspectives. Perhaps you could try expressing your feelings and opinions in a more constructive way, without directly challenging Bill's opinion to avoid triggering his indignation. By doing so, you might be able to deescalate the situation and have a more productive conversation.
It sounds like there's a difference in perspective between you and your husband regarding your competitiveness. While you don't see yourself as competitive, he perceives your actions differently. It's important to communicate with your husband about this issue and try to understand each other's perspectives.

Can you give me an example of a situation where your husband thought you were being competitive, but you didn't agree with him?

Have you considered discussing this with your partner and finding ways to communicate more effectively, so both of you can understand each other's viewpoints and work on resolving disagreements in a healthier manner?
So you feel unappreciated and disconnected when your husband doesn't understand your feelings or support you. It's essential to remember that communication is a two-way street. You've acknowledged similarities between your current and previous marriage. This may indicate that you might have a role to play in these conflicts. Can you identify any patterns in your behavior that might be causing this disconnect with your partners?
It's great that you're recognizing this pattern of behavior and acknowledging that change might be challenging. As your counsellor, I'd encourage you to reflect on the reasons behind this pattern and why it has become difficult for you to let go of it. Are there any specific factors or situations that trigger this behavior?
It's completely normal to have differing opinions on various topics. Engaging in healthy debates can lead to gaining new perspectives and understanding.

It's normal for people to feel anxious in situations where they perceive themselves to be under evaluation, but it's important to remember that everyone makes judgments to some extent.

Also, consider seeking professional help or joining a support group to help you manage your anxiety.
It's natural to experience anxiety before a presentation, but it's important to find ways to manage it. Based on your description, you tend to procrastinate until just a couple of days before your presentation.

This could help you feel more in control and reduce your pre-presentation stress.
I understand that you took a leap of faith and made a decision, which can be quite challenging. It's natural to feel unsure, but it's important to remember the reasons that led to your decision.

It's important to recognize that emotions can have a significant impact on our communication. Rather than suppressing your anger, try finding healthier ways to express it. You can practice deep breathing, take some time out before speaking, or engage in physical activities to reduce and cope with anger. Once you've regained your composure, calmly express your feelings and thoughts to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.
It sounds like you're able to handle your work, but the noisy environment may be affecting others. It's important to be respectful of your classmates and maintain a conducive learning atmosphere. Is there a particular reason why the class becomes loud and disruptive, or is it just a general issue?

It's not really that hard to put in extra effort for a short time. Think about it this way: the difference between a baseball player that bats 250 and one that bats 333 is just 1 hit out of 10 times. So, small improvements can make a noticeable difference. What do you think you could do to improve your grades in this limited time?
It's interesting that you're comparing your academic performance to a sports scenario. It's important to recognize that different areas of life have different expectations and standards. A 333 batting average means that the player is successful about one-third of the time, which could be outstanding in sports but not enough in academics. However, it's good to keep in mind that we should focus on setting our personal standards and not base them solely on external expectations. What do you think would be a fair comparison between your baseball analogy and grading in school?

Putting in that extra effort will not only help you pass the exam but also build your knowledge and confidence.
It's natural to feel concerned about your performance, especially when faced with unexpected challenges. Remember, it's okay not to be perfect in every situation.

It's important to focus on the learning process and grow from these experiences rather than getting overwhelmed by them. Can you think of a specific situation where you faced a curveball, and how you could have handled it differently?
As a counsellor, I can see that you're trying to prepare for this challenge by relying on your existing skills and putting in extra effort. I would just like to ask you, would you consider the possibility of dedicating more than 20 minutes to this task? Remember, it's important to find a balance between your work and personal life, so you can manage stress effectively and become better prepared for whatever the curve may bring.
As a counsellor, I understand your concerns about the results based on the time spent studying. It is evident that 30 minutes of studying contributes to better exam performance than 20 minutes.

However, don't rely solely on this time prediction; instead, focus on understanding the material well and seeking help when needed. Remember, quality of study matters more than quantity.

Yes, when I get mad, I also try to communicate my feelings. One technique I use is saying, 'I'm a little bit upset right now, I'd like to put this on hold until I calm down.'

However, could you please provide more context or specific examples to support your assessment of their performance?
As a counsellor, I can see that you're curious about the difference between a B Algebra player and a C Algebra player. It's true that a B player might have better grades and be more diligent in completing their homework.

I understand that negative experiences, especially with authority figures like teachers, can have a lasting impact on our self-esteem and self-image.

It's interesting how an encounter with a stranger pushed you to reconsider your thoughts about college. It seems that his insistence made an impact on you.

It's important to recognize and work on your self-worth to improve your overall well-being.
It's interesting that you're considering a career in a helping profession like social work, psychology, or counseling. The qualities of kindness and sensitivity that you've been teased for are actually great assets in those fields. They would enable you to empathize and connect with those you're helping, thus showing your strength and value as a professional. What do you think about that?
I'm sorry to hear that you had a negative experience in kindergarten. It's understandable that feeling less competent in a certain area, like handwriting, can affect our self-esteem.

Can you think of any positive qualities or skills that you had during that time or even now that help counterbalance those feelings?

It might be helpful to explore the reasons behind your distrust and work on rebuilding trust with your loved ones. Additionally, you may want to consider seeking professional help to discuss any deep-rooted issues that may be contributing to your behavior. Have you experienced any events in your past that could have led to these trust issues?
Your thought process is good. I want to give you a metaphoric technique. Think of having two buttons on your lap. One is for negative, self-defeating thoughts, which can prevent you from applying or going to grad school. On the other side, on your dominant hand's side, is the button for positive thoughts. Try to choose the positive thoughts button whenever you feel the negative feelings creeping in.
It's great to hear you acknowledging your positive attributes and embracing a more optimistic approach. As your counsellor, I suggest trying a technique called 'Positive Tapping'. While saying good, positive thoughts about yourself, gently tap on your body as a sensory reminder to focus on your strengths. This can help reinforce your self-belief and deter negative thoughts. Give it a try and see how it works for you.
It's completely normal to feel uncertain about your decisions and to seek support from others. However, it's important to work towards becoming more confident in making choices on your own. In regards to your dilemma with honesty, strive for balance between being truthful and respectful of your values. As for the incident with your daughter, it's not too late to have a conversation and express your regret for lying. This can be a learning experience and help you grow as a person.
I'm glad to hear that you feel relieved. As a counsellor, my role is indeed to support and believe in the decisions you want to make rather than advising or directing you. It's important for you to follow your own path and trust yourself. However, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask.

Is there a specific situation or incident that is causing you additional worry?
I understand your concern for your daughter's emotional well-being and your desire to maintain an open relationship with her. Since every child is different, it's hard for me to give you a definitive answer on whether or not to tell her the truth.

Just remember, therapists are human and can make mistakes too. Do you feel comfortable discussing with your therapist how this made you feel and addressing the topic they unintentionally brought up?
As the counsellor, I found your observation about your shoulder fascinating and insightful. It's wonderful that you have such a strong connection with your body, and it's amazing how our bodies can reflect our emotional state. If you don't mind me asking, has this awareness helped you in understanding or managing your emotions better?
It sounds like your shoulder might have some underlying tension or worry. As a counsellor, I suggest you try to communicate with it by asking what might be concerning it. This could help you identify any potential issues or stressors that may need to be addressed.
It's great to hear that you've been practicing and making progress. It's natural for some parts to feel worried, as they usually carry many concerns. I would suggest continuing to practice and build evidence that you can handle things. Additionally, asking yourself 'what are you worried about?' helps address and acknowledge these worries. Is there any specific technique that has been particularly helpful for you?

It's great to see that you have a good relationship with your shoulder, as it helps to keep you grounded and paced. It's important to remember that when you approach a situation with a slower and more gentle mindset, it allows your shoulder to relax and function better. Don't be afraid to express the importance of things in your life and understand that your shoulder is helping you, not hindering you.
As the counsellor, I appreciate your attempts at expressing yourself during our session. It can be difficult to talk about our emotions, and I'm here to support you through this process. It's completely normal to feel hesitant or unsure, and I want to reassure you that your feelings are valid. It's also essential to be open and honest with me, so we can work together to address your concerns. Can you share one emotion that you have been experiencing recently?
It seems like there's a struggle within you to access your emotions, which may be due to past experiences that made expressing emotions like anger unsafe. It's natural to develop coping mechanisms in response to that. When you start to feel overwhelmed by your emotions, try to slowly explore these feelings with an open mindset so you can understand and process them more effectively.
It's great that you're open to exploring these emotions and that you've experienced powerful shifts. Can you share what your shoulder has told you so far about the emotion of anger? This will help us better understand its role in your emotional process and may lead to more insights on how to effectively work through your frustrations.
It's great that you've managed to work on your sobriety and deal with significant traumas. It's understandable that you're now facing difficulties with the smaller issues. When it comes to expressing positive feelings, have you ever noticed any specific thoughts or fears that are holding you back from sharing those emotions with others?
I understand how challenging it must be for you to navigate through these intense dissociative episodes when trying to share your thoughts. It's normal for our body to react defensively and resist discussing certain topics. Let's explore some strategies and techniques that could help you manage these episodes more effectively and potentially improve your connections with others.
It makes sense that, as a trauma response, you have difficulty expressing your emotions with others, even when it comes to positive experiences. It's important to recognize that your body is still allowing you to enjoy the good moments. Regarding your struggle with anger, it is not uncommon for individuals with a history of trauma to suppress or have difficulty processing certain emotions. As a counsellor, I would like to know if you have tried any therapy or treatment to address these emotional challenges?
It sounds like your shoulder may be reacting to a past experience where anger was considered dangerous and needed to be defended against. It didn't just make it up; your shoulder is remembering a time when it was necessary for protection. Can you recall any particular instances or events that might have caused this feeling?
I understand your concern about the consequences of your anger. It's actually healthy to have an internal dialogue with ourselves, as it helps us process our emotions. Since you felt danger in expressing your emotions as a child, it's important now to learn healthier ways to manage your anger and understand its root causes. Is there any specific situation or trigger that causes your anger to escalate?

It's understandable that discussing your anger might make you feel it more intensely. However, avoiding the topic could lead to unresolved emotions. If we explore your anger together, we may find healthier ways to manage it. Can you tell me more about a specific situation that triggered this response in you?
Based on what you're describing, it seems that the tension in your jaw and shoulder is carrying a fight response. Your whole arm engaging with the tension suggests that your shoulder might be feeling the need to defend itself, possibly out of fear or perceiving danger. What do you think?
That's a great observation. It shows that you have a strong connection with your body and its responses to your emotions. By acknowledging and accepting these emotions, you are allowing yourself to process them in a healthy manner. If you were to say it's okay to feel anger, what do you think your shoulder's response would be? Acknowledging and understanding that response would be another step in managing your emotions.
It's wonderful that you have worked hard to earn the trust of your parts and body. It shows that you have proved yourself and made positive changes in your life. Keep nurturing this trust and continue the growth process, allowing your past experiences to serve as a reminder of your resilience and dedication.
As your counsellor, I understand that it's good that your parts trust you, but it seems your shoulder still carries the defenses from living in a potentially dangerous world. It's important to recognize those lingering discomforts and work towards addressing them to achieve a better sense of overall well-being.
It sounds like your shoulder is physically expressing your inner conflict about verbalizing positive feelings. This could be due to a fear of acknowledging something good or a fear of expressing it. Can you think of any specific reasons why your shoulder might be manifesting this worry or what usually triggers the biggest worry about verbalizing positive feelings for you?
This issue of not being able to integrate positive experiences after trauma can be related to the client's brain structures where different parts of the mind and body store memories. It's important to help these parts of the mind understand how things have changed, by repeatedly reinforcing positive images and experiences. For example, if you were able to say 'no' in a certain situation, show yourself that image and remind yourself that nothing bad happened as a result. This can help your mind and body to better integrate the growth and learning that has occurred since the trauma.
It's important to recognize that our brains prioritize survival over other aspects of life. This could explain why your traumatic experiences still feel disconnected from the positive developments in your life. To help you integrate these experiences, try acknowledging and validating the positive aspects of your life when they occur. You may ask yourself, 'Is anything bad happening when something good is present?' This process will allow you to notice the contrast and empower your healing process.
It's great to hear that you are making progress in reassuring yourself and being more aware of your reactions.

It's great to hear that you've made positive changes in your life and achieved stability. However, expecting others to immediately recognize these changes without any communication might not be realistic.

Perhaps you could consider sharing your experiences and progress with those close to you, allowing them to better understand and acknowledge your accomplishments.

It seems like you've gained valuable insights from working with your therapist. To further explore your strengths and resources in healing and growth, can you share which emotions were permissible for you as a child or which have become permissible over the years?
As a counsellor, I understand that it might be difficult for you to open up during our sessions. It's important for you to know that it's okay to take your time, and we can work through this together at your own pace. Your shoulder might be a way for your body to communicate its needs for stability and safety, therefore we should respect those signals, and focus on building trust and creating a safe environment for you.

Reflect on your emotions, and consider how they may influence your approach in supporting the student. If needed, seek opportunities to educate yourself further on bisexuality and the unique challenges faced by bisexual individuals.

It seems like you're using a combination of relaxation, thought-stopping, and refocusing skills to manage your anxiety about social situations. I'm glad to see you applying these techniques. Remember, practice is key to mastering these skills. How often do you find yourself using these techniques in your daily life?
It's great that you've become aware of this negative self-talk, as it's the first step towards managing your anxiety better. It's normal to experience these thoughts, but it's important to remember that they are not always true. Instead of focusing on the negative outcome, try to challenge these thoughts and replace them with more positive and realistic ones, like 'I can handle this situation,' 'It's okay to feel nervous,' and 'People are more focused on themselves than my actions.' By doing this, you may notice a decrease in your anxiety and an increase in your confidence in social situations.
It's normal to feel that way, but just understanding it isn't enough. We need to challenge the self-talk directly and prove if it's telling the truth or not. Since you're willing to try, let's focus on finding alternative predictions that don't overestimate the bad things. Remember, you're stronger than you think.
You're on the right track with practicing muscle relaxation, but managing anxiety goes beyond the physical aspects. In social situations, it's important to shift our focus away from anxiety-provoking thoughts and towards the actions we can take in those situations. Remember, relaxation techniques are just one part of managing anxiety, so try to actively redirect your attention towards positive or neutral thoughts when negative scenarios come up.
Thought-stopping is a technique used to help control anxiety by interrupting negative thoughts. When you notice yourself having an anxious thought, mentally shout 'stop' or picture a stop sign to interrupt the thought process. Once you've stopped the thought, it's important to redirect your focus to what you're supposed to be doing or thinking at the time. This helps shift your attention away from the anxiety-provoking thought and focus on the present moment. Is there any particular aspect of the technique that you'd like more clarification on?
That's great to hear that you've practiced the presentation. As we've done before, I will act as the audience and ask for your SUD rating to monitor your anxiety level.

If you feel anxious, don't hesitate to mention it. Good luck!
It's understandable that you feel nervous when meeting new people. Many people struggle with social anxiety and it can be challenging to engage in conversation when feeling anxious. One way to overcome this is by practicing your social skills in less intimidating situations and learning conversation starters that you feel comfortable using. Also, remember that it's okay to feel nervous, and try to shift your focus to the other person, showing genuine interest in them. If you need further help, consider reaching out to a therapist or a support group for social anxiety. What specific situations do you often find the most challenging?
It's great that you're practicing the guidelines for effective communication. As for your question about maintaining eye contact, there's no specific duration, but the key is to find a balance. Focus on the other person's eyes for a few seconds, then occasionally glance away before refocusing on their eyes again. This way, you won't make the other person feel uncomfortable with excessive eye contact while still showing that you're engaged in the conversation. Keep practicing and stay mindful during your interactions to find what works best for you.
It's normal to feel nervous in difficult situations. As a counsellor, I suggest continuing to test these alternative predictions directly in real-life experiences. As you encounter situations where you manage to handle things even while nervous, your belief in your abilities and the predictions will strengthen. Remember to stay focused and trust yourself.
I'm glad to hear that the practice situations have been helping you manage your anxiety and stay focused.

I understand your concern, and it's important to find a balance between being flexible and making your own choices. While it's okay to be easygoing, it's also crucial to have a voice in the decisions that affect your life. Reflect on what is truly important to you, and consider voicing your opinions and desires to your partner. Remember, it's about finding a path that works for both of you while still prioritizing your happiness and well-being.
As a counsellor, hearing about your relationship, it seems there is room for growth in the area of communication and asking for what you want or need. I would like to give you a homework assignment: try asking your partner for something small and impractical just to see how it feels and how they respond. This exercise may help to open up communication channels and improve your relationship.
It seems like your family's practicality has a strong impact on your decision-making. As a suggestion, consider trying a small experiment where you ask for something you want that might be seen as impractical, just to see how it feels. Also, try to think about the possible consequences of making decisions more focused on your desires and if there's a way for you to trust yourself enough to explain those decisions to your loved ones in a way they might understand.
It's natural to want to make practical decisions in life, especially when it involves big decisions. However, not everything needs to be practical. Some seemingly impractical decisions can also add value to your life in different ways. For example, having children may seem impractical in terms of time and money, but they can provide emotional support and care as you grow older. It's important to consider the bigger picture and not just the practical aspects when making decisions.
It seems like you're facing some difficult decisions. As a possible assignment, try questioning your own ideas in your head. For example, what would happen if you chose to make yourself happy? Consider whether there's a way to talk to your partner that might help them understand your perspective. Remember, change is a part of life, and both you and your partner will need to make adjustments as you grow. It's normal for people to learn and change a lot during certain stages of life, which can be challenging for spouses in many situations. Try exploring these thoughts further to gain more clarity.
I understand your concerns about the therapy sessions not being culturally sensitive and not addressing important aspects of your background. Can you share specific instances where you felt your cultural background was not acknowledged or incorporated into your therapy? It's important that your therapist understands your experiences fully, so that they can tailor their approach to better suit your needs.
It's important for a counselor to be patient and approach the conversation in a non-directive way, adapting to the individual's needs and perspectives. It seems like the previous counselor might have been too structured in their approach. It's great that you recognized the difference in your experience with Dr. Agnes Kwong, where you felt listened to and understood. Moving forward, it might be helpful for you to work with a counselor who focuses on pacing and creating an agenda-free environment.
It's great to hear that you felt connected with your therapist due to her body language and non-verbal cues. These subtle gestures can have a significant impact on building rapport and creating a conducive environment for therapy. As you continue with your sessions, try to maintain awareness of these positive interactions, and don't hesitate to provide feedback or ask for further clarification if needed.
As the counsellor, I understand that it can be difficult to balance peace and achieving your desires. It's important to recognize that not every situation can be entirely peaceful or satisfying. However, by focusing on your priorities, communicating effectively, and practicing self-care, you can navigate these situations more effectively.
It seems that you may be feeling overwhelmed and need some personal space. However, it's wonderful that you are passionate about learning and going to school. Your joy is important. Have you considered discussing your feelings with your partner to help them better understand your passion and possibly support you in your journey?
It's great that you and your partner are in a stable position to start a family. It's natural to have concerns about balancing family life and education. While it may be challenging, it's not necessarily impossible. Have you considered discussing with your partner about potential support and arrangements to manage both family life and your education?
It seems like you're experiencing some regrets and find it difficult to envision your dreams. If you had all the support and no pressure to start a family right now, what do you think you would want to do? Remember, it's never too late to pursue your dreams, regardless of your current age or circumstances.
It's important to recognize oneself and reflect on your values as a person, a wife, and a partner. It might be helpful to think about what qualities you appreciate in your husband, as well as what qualities you think he appreciates in you. In this process, it's also essential to communicate openly with your partner to understand their expectations and express your own. Remember that being a good wife or partner is not about meeting certain criteria but about fostering a healthy and caring relationship with your spouse.
Yes, it is normal to experience frustration during mindfulness practice, as it requires effort and is not a relaxation exercise in the classic sense. It's an exercise of attention where you focus on the present moment and bring your attention back when it wanders off. It's common to lose focus and experience difficult emotions during the process. Don't be discouraged; it's about focusing, losing focus, and returning to focus with compassion. To make it more comfortable, try sitting upright, with your eyes open or closed depending on your preference, and start with short practice sessions.
It's great that you found mindfulness beneficial. Finding the right time to establish a consistent practice is essential for lasting results. You mentioned you pray before going to bed. You may consider incorporating your mindfulness practice into this existing routine by simply adding a few minutes for mindfulness before or after your prayers.

It's great that you are trying to manage your time effectively throughout the week. I'd recommend that you find five minutes every day from Monday to Friday to practice mindfulness or any activity that helps you relax and destress.

It's great to hear that you were able to redirect your thoughts without being hard on yourself. Meditation can indeed heighten our awareness of both external and internal noises. Remember, it's completely normal for thoughts to arise during meditation. The key is to notice them and gently bring your attention back to your breath. Keep practicing and continue to be kind to yourself as you progress on your meditation journey.
Using a mantra can indeed help in focusing during meditation. Different people find different mantras or techniques useful. You can try 'peace in, peace out' or even a Christian mantra if that resonates with you. Another option is counting your breaths, counting from one to ten and then starting over. It's essential to find a technique that works best for you to anchor your attention during meditation.
It sounds like you had a moment of mental stillness during your practice, which can be a valuable experience. The key is to not judge yourself or try to forcefully recreate that state, but rather gently guide your attention back to your breathing when you notice your mind wandering.

It’s wonderful to hear that you experienced a moment of peace and calmness in your mind. However, I'd like to ask if this is something new for you or if you've had similar experiences before? Knowing the context can help me better understand your feelings and provide appropriate guidance.
It's essential to understand that losing focus is a natural part of mindfulness meditation. The process involves focus, losing focus, and refocusing. Don't be hard on yourself when your mind wanders. To refocus, you can try different techniques like labeling thoughts or gently acknowledging them and returning your attention to your breath. Practicing this regularly can rewire your brain and help you develop a more compassionate perspective on your thoughts.
Yes, it's because every time you practice mindfulness and refocus your attention, new neuro-firings occur. The more your neurons fire together, the stronger their connections become, which eventually leads to a thicker prefrontal cortex. This is due to how our brain's structure adapts to the way we use it. In the case of consistent mindfulness practitioners, the prefrontal cortex is strengthened, typically resulting in improved cognitive control and emotional regulation.
Yes, with regular mindfulness practice, you'll find that you can manage your stress response more effectively. Mindfulness has been shown to help people shut off their stress response more quickly and gain more conscious control over it. As a result, you will be able to calm yourself down after a stressful situation and not stay agitated.
Yes, it's normal for certain situations to require more effort in managing stress, such as dealing with your boss or with close relationships.

It's great to hear that you're feeling much better. As for mindfulness, it's a useful skill to develop to help enhance your overall well-being. It involves paying attention to the present moment non-judgmentally, which can help manage stress, anxiety, and improve focus. Let's explore some specific techniques you can practice to develop your mindfulness skills. How do you usually cope with stress or difficult situations?
It's not strange to use the term 'relapse' with depression as it can be an ongoing struggle for some people. I understand your concern though. Can you tell me more about your experience with depression and what specific aspects of relapse worry you?
Yes, mindfulness is an effective way to tackle depression relapses. It is a type of meditation that you would practice regularly to help you stay more present and aware of your thoughts and emotions. Research has shown that incorporating mindfulness in your daily routine can significantly reduce the relapse rate for depression. It has gained a lot of attention in recent times, and there are various resources available online to help you get started with mindfulness practice.
Yes, there is a practice called contemplative prayer in Christian tradition, particularly in Catholicism. St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa are known to have started the contemplative approach. It has gained popularity, especially in the last half of the 20th century with the rise in mindfulness research. When practicing mindfulness, remember to be non-judgmental and simply observe the present moment, which can be incorporated into your contemplative prayer.
It's understandable to feel overwhelmed with information. But don't worry, all the information you need is available on our website. You can take your time to review it and better understand the differences between Buddhism and Christianity mindfulness practices. Remember, the goal is to help you achieve a quiet mind and foster your connection with the divine.
You've got a good understanding of mindfulness; it is indeed about being present and aware of the current moment. A key aspect we'll focus on is your breath, which can help anchor you in the present. It's essential to practice mindfulness without judgment and with compassion, as this promotes self-acceptance and growth. Is there a particular area in your life that you'd like to implement mindfulness?
Yes, we can definitely incorporate this into our sessions. We can spend as much or as little time as you would like. For instance, we can start with just two minutes to help clear your mind when you arrive after facing traffic. Let's try it in our next session and see how it works for you.
It's wonderful to hear that you're excited and grateful for our sessions. I'm also looking forward to our progress together. In the meantime, please remember the strategies and tools we've discussed to help you cope with any challenges you may face.
It's completely normal for your mind to wander during mindfulness meditation. The key is to respond with compassion and understanding when you catch your mind wandering. Gently bring your focus back to your breath and continue observing your breathing without judgment. Remember that the goal is not to eliminate all thoughts, but to practice being present and non-judgmental with your thoughts and experiences.
It's great that you've practiced relaxation before. As we meditate together, remember to focus on your breath, knowing that your mind will naturally wander off at times. When it does, feel free to use the 'yes, and that too' approach, or you may also try visualizing clouds or labeling your thoughts. Just gently bring your attention back to your breath and continue the practice. Enjoy the experience, and be patient with yourself.
As a counsellor, I commend you for your efforts to manage your negative thoughts by combining different techniques and focusing on your breath. The most important aspect is not to be hard on yourself throughout this process. Remember, it might be challenging for you initially, but with consistency, you will eventually improve.
It's great that you gave meditation a try! It's normal to feel like 60 seconds is too short, especially when you're starting out. Your brain might just be getting used to the idea of meditation. With practice, you'll be able to determine the ideal duration for your sessions. Do you have any questions or concerns about the meditation practice itself?
That's a good sign! It indicates that you should practice meditation for longer durations as it's proving to be beneficial for you. I recommend gradually increasing the meditation time to help maintain focus and reap its benefits.
It's common for people to face challenges in incorporating meditation into their daily routine. I recommend starting with shorter sessions, like 5 minutes, which most of my clients find beneficial. To alleviate your anxiety about the duration, use a pleasant-sounding timer, like your watch or an MP3 timer from a meditation website. This helps you stay relaxed, knowing that it'll notify you when the session is complete. It's all about easing into the practice and finding what works best for you.
It's great that you're exploring different meditation practices and understanding their similarities and differences. Remember, meditation is a personal journey, and the key is to be patient with yourself as you learn and grow. As you begin your meditation practice, try focusing on your breath and staying present in the moment. Over time, you'll see improvements and gain new insights. Don't be too hard on yourself if you find it challenging initially, as it's a lifelong process. Let me know if you have specific concerns or need guidance along the way.
As a counsellor, I suggest that you could try incorporating the mindfulness practice either before or after your praying routine at night, since you're consistent with it. You may experiment to see which option feels better for you – meditating first to clear your mind before prayer, or praying first and then practicing mindfulness. It's important to choose a time when you have a fair amount of control over your schedule and you're not too tired.
It's great that you're disciplined and making time for spiritual practice. I recommend creating a dedicated space or having a special chair for this activity. Having a cross, Bible, or other spiritual items might help as well. A dedicated space can serve as a visual reminder, making it easier to maintain consistency. Additionally, you can keep a log to track your progress and stay motivated.

Also, make sure to give yourself enough time to think about your decisions, rather than rushing into any choices.

As a counsellor, I appreciate your reflection on your parenting role. It's interesting that you feel like secondary parents, but I don't see any relevance in the even versus odd number of kids. It's most likely a coincidence, and your parenting roles might depend on various factors, such as individual personalities, parenting style, and family dynamic. Can you elaborate more on why you feel like secondary parents?
It's possible that the difference in your situation may be contributing to feelings of independence and accomplishment since you've managed to create a unique career path for yourself through freelancing and working in community health and theater.

If you're still concerned, you can ask your son how he thinks this career choice will benefit him in the long run.

It sounds like you've experienced prejudice due to people making incorrect assumptions about your identity based on your physical appearance. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Can you share more about how this incident affected you or your feelings at the time?
It's understandable that you might feel uncertain about how to identify yourself on forms, especially if you've had conflicts over it in the past. It's important to remember that your own identity and experiences are valid, regardless of how you choose to label yourself. If you're comfortable with it, you could continue checking 'Other,' or you could explore different options to see which feels most suitable for you.
I can understand how frustrating and confusing it must be for you to deal with such situations on a daily basis. It's natural to feel overwhelmed or exhausted by these experiences. It might be helpful to engage in conversations that educate others about your background and address these misconceptions. Alternatively, consider joining support groups or connecting with people who share similar experiences. Please feel free to share any specific incidents or concerns you would like to discuss.
It's quite understandable that your breakup has resulted in you feeling more private about your experiences, as your boyfriend was someone who could empathize with your unique perspective. It's important to find alternative ways to share your thoughts and emotions, such as reaching out to supportive friends or joining online communities with similar experiences. Regarding counseling being less acceptable in your community, consider exploring different forms of support to help you through this tough time.
It's understandable that opening up to someone new can be challenging, and feeling isolated during difficult times can be tough.

We'll work together to address any concerns and make sure the process is as comfortable as possible for you. If anything makes you uncomfortable during our sessions, please feel free to share it with me.
As a counsellor, I understand it might be difficult to articulate your feelings sometimes. Don't worry, we can work through this together. Can you try to describe just one situation or emotion that has been bothering you lately?
That makes a lot of sense to me. I think a lot of people, if not most, have some kind of anxiety about coming into counseling even if it’s not going against their cultural norms. Just the fact of being here and talking about important things and being a little vulnerable with someone you don’t know can be pretty intimidating. Can you tell me more about how your cultural background influences your feelings about counseling?
I appreciate your willingness to discuss this. It seems that talking about these concerns connects back to the importance of your identity. If you ever feel isolated during our conversations, please let me know, as I want to be sensitive to that.

I understand that this is a big step for you, considering your family's expectations and cultural values. It must be challenging for you to open up about your concerns to someone outside of your immediate family. My goal is to provide a safe and supportive environment where we can work together to find the resources and support you need. Remember, seeking help is a brave action, and it's okay to step beyond your comfort zone for your well-being.
As a counsellor, I appreciate your willingness to go beyond traditional cultural norms to seek help during that difficult time in your life. It's important to be open to new experiences, especially when it comes to mental health. Can you share more about the challenges you faced when you first moved to the US and how the counseling session helped you, if at all?
I'm sorry to hear that your previous therapy experience didn't work out well. It's important to have a strong relationship with your counselor for the therapy to be effective. Could you share what specifically made you feel disconnected from the previous counselors? Knowing that may help us improve our approach and create a better therapeutic relationship this time.
It's completely normal to feel hesitant and ashamed about discussing such sensitive topics, but I'm glad you decided to open up. I'll make sure to be open-minded, understanding, and ask questions rather than making assumptions. So, you mentioned having suicidal thoughts – can you share more about what's been going on that led to these thoughts, and how they've impacted your life?
I understand your concerns about confidentiality and trust. As a psychologist, I am ethically bound to keep our conversations confidential. The only exceptions are when there is a serious risk of you hurting yourself or someone else. Otherwise, everything we discuss will remain between us.
As a counsellor, I assure you that everything you say here stays here, with the exception of reporting child abuse or elder abuse. In such situations, I'm legally obligated to break confidentiality. If we approach any of those other sensitive topics during our sessions, I will inform you that we are nearing that line of confidentiality. My main goal is to support you in making decisions that you feel good about and ensuring your well-being.
I'm glad to hear that my explanation has helped you feel more comfortable with the situation. It's great to see that you have appropriate expectations and goals for therapy. As your counselor, I'll be working alongside you to help you achieve those goals. Feel free to express any concerns or questions you may have as we progress through our sessions.
It's understandable that you're feeling exhausted. Healing and dealing with these emotions can be tiring, and it's important to pace yourself during this process. I want to emphasize that you don't have to go through this alone. Since you're used to being the one who provides support, it might be challenging to ask for help. My question for you is: who else in your life can you reach out to for support and allow them to be there for you?
It's understandable that asking for help can be difficult, especially when you're used to being in control. It's great that you've recognized the need for support and have already reached out. Involving your husband could be helpful, but if it's hard for you, consider exploring why it's challenging and if there's someone else you feel more comfortable reaching out to. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and lean on others for support.
It sounds like you're experiencing challenges relating to others due to the difference in life experiences. As a counsellor, I would suggest finding ways to bridge that gap by sharing your story with others and connecting with those who have similar experiences. Also, try to be open to other perspectives while maintaining your own understanding of the world. Is there any specific event or situation where you faced difficulty in making someone understand your perspective?
Yes, I understand what you mentioned earlier. Generally, it's okay not to have a specific issue to discuss at the moment. Sometimes, just talking about general thoughts or feelings can be beneficial. If anything specific comes to mind later, feel free to bring it up in our future sessions.
It's understandable that your experiences as a woman and a black woman in the military have led you to feel the need to perform at a higher level and put up a tough exterior. This has built up layers of emotional armor that separate you from your true feelings, making it difficult to be vulnerable. Recognizing these layers and their origin is an essential step towards healing and allowing yourself to eventually let down your guard.
It's important to recognize that you have the right to experience a full range of emotions. It may help to remind yourself that you're no longer in the battle zone. Practice being gentle with yourself as there are indeed many layers to your situation. Acknowledge the complexity of your emotions and experiences. Remember that this doesn't mean you won't heal or become whole again - it's just a process that takes time and self-care. You're also allowed to be irritated about the unfairness of the situation. Stay patient with yourself and seek opportunities to process your emotions whenever possible.
I understand that it can be difficult to open up about your feelings and thoughts, especially when you feel like people around you don't understand. It's important to find a safe space where you can express yourself without fear of judgment. Sometimes that can be with a therapist, support group, or a trusted friend. Remember that it's normal to feel vulnerable when sharing personal feelings, and it may take time to get comfortable doing so. Is there any specific event or issue that is causing you the most distress?
I understand your concern, but when I say falling apart, I mean allowing yourself to express the feelings that you've been keeping inside in order to stay safe and focused. It's important to remember that you have a right to your feelings, such as sadness and fear, especially now that you're in a safer environment. The goal is to help you break the cycle of reliving the pain and suppressing your emotions.
It sounds like you're experiencing some ongoing stress that might be affecting your energy levels and mood. Let's try to unpack the irritation a bit more - can you think of any specific situations, or is it a more general feeling throughout the day?
I understand how challenging it must be to live in a constant state of irritation and feeling like you can't find peace. It seems that this might be related to the PTSD and wounding from your military service, keeping you in a state of being at war. Have you ever thought about this connection before, and how it may be influencing your daily life?
As a counsellor, I understand that it's a challenging process to make sense of your experiences, especially when you had to focus on survival. Soldiers experience unimaginable situations, and it's important to find ways to process these emotions and fears. It's great that you recognize the need for this. I'm here to provide a safe space for you to talk about your experiences, and together, we can work on finding the best way for you to cope and heal.
It seems like your irritation increases when you feel out of control or overwhelmed by a situation. It's important to recognize these triggers and practice coping strategies to manage your emotions effectively. One possible technique to explore is mindfulness, which can help you gain better control over your reactions. Additionally, you may want to consider seeking professional support to better understand these patterns and develop effective coping strategies.
It sounds like you're experiencing heightened levels of stress and anxiety due to various factors in your life. It's perfectly normal for your emotions to react this way in response to threatening situations. It might be helpful to practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation, to help calm your body and mind. Are there specific situations or factors that contribute to your emotional energy being drained, besides the traffic incident?
I understand that feeling startled can be challenging. It seems like you're on high alert due to your need for control. I'm wondering what it would be like for you to practice being gentle with yourself and try to understand the underlying reasons for this need for control. It might help you in reducing the feelings of being startled and improve your overall well-being.
It sounds like you're experiencing intense irritation and discomfort. To better understand its nature, let's try an exercise where we externalize this feeling, as if it were separate from you. This will help us figure out why your 'last nerve' has no peace. We can then explore the situations that trigger this irritation and if it's somehow related to fear or anxiety. This might be uncomfortable initially, but it's a step towards coping with your emotions.
It's completely normal for the process of externalizing emotions to feel strange at first. Your therapist is using this technique to help you gain a better understanding of your irritation and learn how to negotiate with it. Essentially, by treating it as a separate entity, you can more effectively address and manage the emotion. It's important to keep an open mind and give the process a chance. If you're still struggling with this approach, don't hesitate to express your concerns to your therapist so they can provide more guidance or adjust their approach if necessary.
It's completely normal to feel irritated in such situations. However, understanding and managing these reactions can make a big difference. Try to practice mindfulness and deep breathing techniques when you notice this irritation. This could help you be more present and remain calm during unexpected situations. Is there any specific incident in the past that has caused you to develop this aversion to surprises?
It's essential to recognize that your hyper vigilance serves a protective purpose, but it's over functioning. The key is to find ways to comfort yourself when you've been startled or scared, without judging yourself. Since your usual coping mechanisms, like reading a book, aren't applicable in some situations, try taking deep breaths and focusing on your surroundings to ground yourself in the moment. Remember that your ultimate goal is to regain control over your reactions and not to hurt yourself.
It's important to practice grounding techniques in those moments. You can take deep breaths, turn on some music, or find a distraction. When you return to a safe place, check in with yourself and remind yourself that it's safe to notice your feelings now. It may be uncomfortable, but practicing this will help you better manage those overwhelming emotions.
I understand your concern. It's important for both you and your partner to learn how to be more honest, open, and vulnerable with each other. I can help by educating him and training both of you to create a supportive and understanding environment. Keep in mind that you're still responsible for your healing, but your partner can help co-create a space for you to feel comfortable discussing your experiences.
Yes, I agree that forming a small group of women with similar experiences can be beneficial for you. They would understand things from a very visceral place and it would also serve as a reality check. That's why I'm considering putting together such a group, because it seems that there's a lack of mirrors for people like you to connect and share your experiences.
It's important to recognize that it's okay to seek support from others, including your husband. By opening up, you're not only allowing yourself to be vulnerable but also giving your relationship an opportunity to grow and become more reciprocal. Trust can take time to build, and it's normal for people to make mistakes, but communication and practicing sharing your feelings can help strengthen your bond with your husband. If needed, we can bring him into the therapy process to help both of you understand each other's needs better.
It's important to slow down, acknowledge your reaction, and understand that it's a human response. To take care of yourself, try to access your body wisdom and pay attention to how your body reacts. Think about what you would do to comfort someone else in distress, like talking to them or making them laugh, and apply that same care and support to yourself without judgment. Focus on your right to comfort and don't be too hard on yourself for having a reaction.
It's great that you recognize the need for self-compassion and are trying to find ways to support yourself, just like you do for others. Consider exploring activities that bring you joy, comfort, or relaxation, and practice engaging in them when you need to shift your focus away from judgment and self-criticism. Additionally, remember to be patient with yourself and acknowledge the progress you make in your journey towards self-compassion. Is there any specific stress-relieving activity you already have in mind or would like to try?
It's great that you want to make a positive change and carry forward your mother's legacy.

It's important to remember that everyone deals with grief differently, and there's no right or wrong way to feel or express your emotions. However, it's concerning that you're turning to alcohol as a coping mechanism. It's alright to feel sad and grieve, and it might be helpful to talk to a professional or a support group about your feelings and explore healthier ways to cope with your grief. Do you have any support system or people you feel comfortable sharing your emotions with?
It sounds like you have been through some tough times, and the concerns of your girlfriend have made you reflect on your drinking habits.

It seems that you've been using drinking to maintain a sense of control and mask your true emotions. It's understandable that you feel embarrassed about your behavior, especially when it impacts important events like weddings. I can see that being in control is important to you, but it's crucial to address the root cause of your feelings and find healthier coping mechanisms. Did anything happen recently in your life that might have triggered the increased need for control and reliance on drinking?
It sounds like you are going through a difficult time coping with the loss of your mother and using alcohol as a means to manage your emotions. It's important to remember that everyone's journey in life is different, and comparing yourself to your mother may not be helpful. Have you considered seeking therapy or support to discuss these feelings and explore healthier coping mechanisms?
It seems that drinking provides you temporary relief from your emotional struggle with your mom's legacy, but the low that follows feels even harder to handle. It is great that you recognize you feel stronger when you face your emotions and engage in healthier activities like going to the gym. Have you considered trying to find additional healthier coping mechanisms to manage your emotions in social situations and maintain your mom's legacy in a more consistent and sustainable way?

Do you think there might be other sources of strength in your life that you haven't acknowledged yet?
It's great to hear that your loved one is attending classes more frequently now. It's natural to be worried about someone we care about.

Is there any specific concern that you still have?
It's understandable to be concerned about your son's behavior and associations. It's encouraging that he is attending probation meetings and staying in touch with you daily.

Is there any specific change you would like to see in his behavior?

Additionally, I would recommend that you also seek support for yourself, be it through therapy or a support group, to help you better manage these difficult times.
I understand your concerns about your son's behavior. It can be challenging to deal with these situations, especially when it feels like past programs haven't been effective. We could explore different approaches and resources that might be more beneficial for him. Have you considered family therapy or other support services within the community to help address these issues?

It sounds like you want to improve communication and build trust with your partner, as well as sharing more responsibilities around the house. A good approach might be to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and needs. You can express your concerns about his whereabouts, the need for more transparency, and the importance of spending time together at home. During this conversation, try to stay focused on your feelings and needs, and avoid blaming or accusing him. Ask him about his thoughts and feelings as well, so you both can have a better understanding of each other's perspectives.
It's great that you want to connect with your son and show interest in his writing.

I understand that trying to avoid your fear has not been effective and may have even contributed to your fear increasing.

Instead of avoiding your fear, try to acknowledge its presence and be willing to experience it. This may help you regain control and expand your life once again.
I understand that your anxiety can be overwhelming, but it's important to remember that your nervous system is a powerful tool that can help you. It's natural to feel anxious in certain situations, but labeling it as bad or failure may only increase your distress. Try to focus on accepting your anxiety instead of fighting it, and gradually learn how to navigate social situations without being too harsh on yourself. Remember, the first step is accepting and acknowledging the anxiety, not controlling it.

I'm not saying this to make you feel better right now, but to let you know your feelings are valid. Can you give me a few examples of the feelings or thoughts you're having in this moment?
It seems that you're starting to experience some clarity after feeling confused, and you can sense a slight opening. Can you tell me more about what may have contributed to this shift?
I'm glad to hear you're feeling more hopeful. It's important to recognize that the goal of our sessions is not solely to help you feel hopeful, but to provide you with tools and strategies to address your concerns. Remember to take note of your thoughts and feelings, as this can be helpful in understanding your progress.
It's essential to find ways to manage stress, as it can negatively impact our well-being. Start by prioritizing your tasks and breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps. Focus on one task at a time instead of trying to multi-task. Set aside time for self-care, like exercise, meditation, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. Additionally, don't hesitate to ask for support from friends, family, or a mental health professional if needed. If you are open to it, can you share any specific stressors at work or home that are causing you the most distress?
Candace, it seems like you're acknowledging that your conscious, deliberate efforts haven't been working effectively and you're unsure about what to do. I understand it might feel frustrating and confusing. Can you tell me more about the specific situation or issues you've encountered during this process so that we can work together to identify a more helpful approach?
It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulties in coping with a particular issue. I would like to suggest that we take a closer look at the situation and try to understand the pattern of this struggle. Together, we can identify new strategies and approaches that may help you work through this challenge more effectively. Please feel free to share more about the issue you're facing.
It sounds like you've tried coping by staying at home and surrounding yourself with familiar people to feel safe and comfortable. While it's important to have a support system, it may also be helpful to challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone at times in order to grow. Do you think there's something specific that makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable in other situations?
It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to perform perfectly, which might be causing you to avoid taking risks or challenges. You're doing well in managing your fears, but it's important to consider stepping outside of your comfort zone and take on challenges to foster growth. What is one small challenge you could take on to start building your confidence?
It's understandable that you might feel afraid, especially if previous attempts haven't paid off. In order to overcome this fear and take on more challenges, we can work on identifying and addressing any internal barriers or limiting beliefs that might be holding you back. Additionally, I would like to know if there are any specific challenges at work that you'd like to focus on?
It seems like you've been putting in a lot of effort to overcome your fear and negative feelings, but these methods have not been working for you. Instead of trying to control your fear and emotions, let's explore ways to accept and make room for them in your life so that they no longer hold you back. It's also important to work on building your self-compassion and resilience. Have you ever tried mindfulness or self-compassion exercises in your journey to manage these feelings?
I understand that you might feel frustrated after seeing multiple therapists and not feeling any progress. It's important for us to work together to identify your specific concerns and goals, so that we can make a plan tailored to your needs. What would you like to achieve from our sessions? Let's focus on setting realistic expectations and working towards those together.
It sounds like you're struggling with self-esteem issues and comparing yourself to others. It's important to remember that everyone has unique strengths and weaknesses, and it's not fair or realistic to hold yourself to the same standard as others. Instead, focus on recognizing and acknowledging your own accomplishments and work on building your confidence through small, achievable steps.
I understand that you're experiencing feelings of disappointment and failure, and it feels like a heavy burden for you. It's essential to recognize these feelings as valid, but also remember that they don't define your worth. Can you think of a specific situation or situations where you felt this way?
It's great that you have been proactive in trying to improve your situation, but it's important to remember that just understanding the concepts in self-help books might not be enough to make significant changes in your life. Applying the knowledge and working on personal growth takes time and effort. I would recommend giving therapy another try and discussing your concerns with a professional, who can help tailor an approach suitable for your specific situation and challenges. Is there anything else that you have tried or feel could be helpful in your journey towards personal growth?
It sounds like you've tried to push yourself into social situations to become more comfortable, but haven't had success yet. Can you share what specific techniques you've tried and how they didn't work for you? I might be able to suggest some alternative approaches to help you feel more at ease in social settings.
I can understand how you feel overwhelmed and frustrated when trying to talk to people. It can be difficult to manage social situations, but it's important to remember that this is a learning process. What specific situations or interactions cause you the most distress?
It sounds like you've been experiencing challenges in overcoming your fears and struggles. Instead of continuing to use the same methods that don't seem to be working, perhaps it's time to try something entirely new – so different that it feels like a new game. Remember, growth often happens when we step out of our comfort zones and experiment with new approaches. Can you identify something you haven't tried before that might help you overcome your current challenges?
It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of being trapped, and none of the ways you've attempted to improve your situation seem to be working. I'd like to ask you, why do you think these efforts aren't successful in getting you out of this metaphorical hole?
Thank you for sharing your concerns. It's important to acknowledge your mind's efforts to solve your problems, but also be skeptical of its approach. Sometimes, our minds can become stuck in unhelpful patterns. Instead of focusing on digging differently, try to understand the root of the issue and explore alternative ways to cope or move forward. If you still feel uncertain, don't hesitate to reach out for further guidance.
It seems like you've been working really hard to find solutions, and I understand that it can be frustrating when things don't seem to be improving. It's possible that there might be another approach or perspective that could help. Could you further explain what specific methods or strategies you've tried, so I can better understand your situation and offer some suggestions?
Consider the possibility that it might be a rigged game, like a gambling deal where you can't win. I want you to look at what the data is telling you – that the more you work on this, the worse it gets. I have some thoughts on the reasons behind it, but I'd like you to reflect on your own experiences to understand why this might be happening.
It seems like this issue is consuming a significant part of your life and causing you distress. It's important to remember that focusing on the problem all the time might not always lead to a solution but could end up causing more stress. Have you considered trying new approaches or seeking support from others to help address this issue?
Thank you for sharing your situation. Let's not try to figure everything out right now. Sometimes, our efforts to come up with a solution can actually contribute to the problem. Consider the possibility that seeking an immediate solution might not be helping you in this situation. Focus on being present, in this room, with me, and let's start by addressing your concerns without expecting a magic answer.
I understand that you feel stuck, and it's important to acknowledge this feeling. Instead of digging deeper into the problem, let's try a different approach. It's possible that more of the same won't help you overcome this feeling. Let's focus on understanding and accepting your current situation and explore new ways to address it.
I apologize if it feels like I'm one-upping you; my intention is to create an even level conversation. It's natural to feel confused at first, but it's also a good sign, as it indicates a willingness to explore further. Regarding the hope you feel, it's interesting that you find it in the statement about there being no way out. As for an agenda, my primary goal is to help you address concerns and grow, not to impose a personal agenda.
It's interesting to note that comfort can have two meanings. In one sense, it means feeling strong, while in another, it refers to the actions we take to feel comfortable. Sometimes, the actions we take to feel comfortable might not lead to feeling strong or having comfort the feeling. Try to focus more on the actions that can bring you strength in the long run, rather than short-term comfort.
It's normal to feel that way sometimes. We can't always rely on our mind to figure things out instantly. Instead, we should focus on building our inner strength and resilience. In the example I gave, you were able to remember the numbers quite easily. This shows that you can indeed retain information and find strength in situations when needed. However, remember that it's a continuous process that involves practice and self-awareness. Take some time to reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, and work on improving them gradually.
It's interesting how our mind tends to hold onto information, especially when attached to a significant incentive like a million dollars. It's okay to remember those numbers even though the promise turned out to be false. Our thoughts and memories are just a part of our mental landscape; we can choose to accept their presence without giving them too much importance. Do you find it difficult to let go of thoughts or memories in other situations?
It's important to realize that sometimes, struggling against our fears can actually make them worse. Think of it like quicksand - the more you struggle, the deeper you sink. Instead, try to accept and embrace your fear so that you can fully connect with it. This may seem counterintuitive, but it's the only safe thing to do. It's a skill that can be learned, like playing a sport. What sports have you played?
It's common for our minds to focus on perfection, but in activities like swimming, it's our bodies that have the ability to perform well. You might find it helpful to treat swimming as a skill to learn and trust your body, rather than letting your mind take over. This can apply to other situations in life, like social situations where you feel stuck or anxious. Remember to give yourself some grace and focus on the process rather than perfection.
It's normal to feel that way during an anxious or stressful situation. Is this sensation causing any distress or impacting your daily life? If so, we can discuss some ways to cope with these feelings and develop strategies to manage your anxiety.
As a counsellor, I understand that hope is a good sign, but it's natural to still have questions. So please, feel free to share your concerns or doubts, and I will do my best to address them and provide you with the information and support you need to overcome your challenges.
It's interesting to hear that you're exploring alternative ways to solve your problems by going out in the field and wandering around. Although it's not a completely new thought, it's still a positive step towards change. Can you share more about your experience and how it helps you in dealing with your problems?
It's great that you've been trying to understand your problems, but sometimes focusing too much on them can make you feel stuck. Instead, let's not dwell on figuring out the issues and work on focusing on positive strategies and solutions that can help you move forward.
It's not uncommon for negative thoughts to surface, especially during stressful situations. It's crucial to acknowledge these thoughts and work towards redirecting them. Maybe you can try practicing mindfulness or journaling to help process these thoughts more effectively. Is there any specific situation or event that triggered these negative thoughts?
It seems like you're struggling with expressing yourself openly to others. My suggestion for you, as a smart and talented person with many good qualities, is to practice being more vocal about your feelings. One homework assignment I'd like you to try is to tell people you care about that you appreciate them and give them compliments. This may help you become more comfortable with expressing yourself.
It's understandable that you might feel uncomfortable expressing affection, especially if you don't receive the same response back. However, it could be an interesting experiment to try it again and see how it goes. Sometimes, it takes practice and time to feel more comfortable with expressing affection. Remember, you mentioned being willing to try new things at least once. So, don't give up on it just yet; maybe try it with different people or in different situations.
It seems like you're becoming aware of how your body language and actions are sending messages to others, whether intentional or not. One way to show people that they matter to you is by being more open and engaging in your posture and demeanor. For instance, you could try uncrossing your legs and paying more attention to them during conversations. By doing this, you'll be conveying that you genuinely care about their feelings and opinions.
I can understand how not letting people get to you helped you develop a tough exterior. It's like an exercise - the more you use that muscle, the stronger it becomes. However, it's important to remember that having emotions and allowing yourself to feel and express them is a necessary part of being human. You might want to consider finding a balance between being emotionally strong and still allowing yourself to be vulnerable at times.
It sounds like you may struggle with expressing your feelings and showing vulnerability in your relationships. This can potentially create issues, as it's important for both partners to feel emotionally supported and connected. Recognizing this pattern is a great first step towards change. Can you think of a specific situation where you found it difficult to express your feelings or care for someone, and how it affected that relationship?
I see that you're struggling with accepting compliments and recognizing positive aspects of our sessions. It's common for people to downplay their achievements or positive experiences. Remember, acknowledging and appreciating positive moments can help boost your self-esteem and overall mental well-being. What's one thing you liked about today's conversation that made it enjoyable for you?
It's great to hear that you enjoyed the experience and felt special. Being in a video could indeed be a unique opportunity for some people, and it's completely valid that you found the experience enjoyable. As for why you were chosen, it's difficult to say, but the important thing is that you were able to share your perspective and contribute to the conversation.
It sounds like you're dealing with feelings of low self-esteem. I have an assignment for you to try: Go around and compliment people a few times, without expecting anything in return. Focus on giving to others and see what happens to your own self-esteem. You can approach it as an experiment, and remember that perfection is not the goal; instead, focus on embracing the experience.
It's important to recognize that setbacks in one area of your life don't necessarily make you a complete failure. You've been able to maintain your job for two years, which suggests that you have some skills and abilities. It's natural to face challenges in friendships and other aspects, but try not to let those experiences define your entire self-worth. Focus on your strengths and achievements to maintain a more balanced view of yourself.
It's important to remember that everyone has moments of self-doubt, but it doesn't mean you're a failure. Focus on your accomplishments and positive qualities. If you still struggle with these thoughts, try talking to someone you trust or consider seeking professional help.
It's natural to have such feelings given your experiences with your father and your relationship with Patrick. Your emotional reactions, like tears and welling up, are normal and appropriate in this situation. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and work on changing thoughts that do not fit with the reality of who you truly are.
It sounds like the situation with Lizzie was quite distressing for you, causing anxiety and difficulty in breathing. Can you tell me about any actions you took in response to those feelings during or after the incident?

How has this experience affected your personal and emotional well-being, and have you been able to find support or healthy outlets for dealing with these emotions?
It's clear that your mother was a special person in your life, who offered encouragement and helped you view yourself in a more positive light. It's natural to miss her, especially during challenging times. If you're comfortable, could you share more about the qualities in her that you admired, so you can channel that resilience she saw in you?
It's quite possible that the timing of your panic attacks is connected to your unresolved grief for your mom, especially considering the age similarity between you and your daughter. It might be helpful for you to address this grief and explore how it's been affecting you over the years, which could potentially help in managing your panic attacks.
It's important for us to address these thoughts and break the cycle. There are two aspects to consider: 1) What can you do to change these negative thoughts in your head? 2) Where did these thoughts and feelings come from? Let's start by identifying ways to break the cycle and then explore the origins of these feelings.
It's important to recognize that everyone makes mistakes and nobody is perfect. However, constantly believing that you're a total failure is not accurate. Can you mention any situation where you've succeeded or done something right to challenge this negative thought?
It sounds like you've shown great determination and resilience in both taking care of your family and pursuing your education despite your father's discouraging words. How did you manage to find the strength to overcome these challenges and still find success?
It's commendable that you were able to pursue your passion in interior design despite your father's discouraging words. This shows your resilience and determination. Your child going to college is also a great achievement. It's important to recognize your strengths and accomplishments, as it will help you see that you've overcome challenges and are not a total failure.
It's great to hear that your kids are doing okay. Can you tell me more about these changes you've been noticing and how they're impacting your life?
It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, especially related to your relationship with your daughter and your own past experiences. It's natural for adolescents to challenge their parents, but it's important to remind yourself that your worth is not determined by their approval. Do you think there's a connection between your mother's passing and your current feelings?
It sounds like you have dealt with a significant amount of responsibility and stress from a young age. It's understandable that you're concerned about how your past experiences might impact your daughter. Can you share more about your current relationship with your daughter and any specific worries you have regarding her well-being?
It sounds like you had a lot of responsibilities at a young age, which may have impacted your emotional well-being. It's important to recognize the need to process emotions rather than suppressing them. What specific steps have you taken to deal with these feelings since then, and have you considered seeking some form of support, like therapy, to help you process your emotions and the impact of your father's behavior on you?
It sounds like you had a very special moment with your daughter, Lizzie. It's great that you were able to connect with her through sharing memories and stories about your mother. These conversations can be really important for strengthening family bonds and passing down family history. How has this experience affected your emotional well-being since then?
I'm glad to hear that you've noticed positive changes in yourself since we first began our sessions. It's important to acknowledge your progress, as it shows that the counselling is contributing to your growth. Keep focusing on the changes, and don't hesitate to ask for any further assistance whenever you need. How do you feel about your progress so far?
It's great to hear that you have made such progress in recognizing your triggers and managing your thoughts. These are essential skills for managing anxiety and other mental health challenges. It's also positive that you're improving your communication skills and opening up to others about your feelings. Keep practicing these strategies and continue to seek support as needed. Do you have any specific techniques that have been particularly helpful for you during this journey?
Yes, I understand your concern. To start addressing this issue, it would be helpful for you to observe when you're experiencing these emotional attacks and when you're suppressing your feelings. In our next session, we can discuss these incidents and work together on effective ways to manage your emotions, set goals for therapy, and create a plan for improvement. Does that make sense?
It sounds like you experienced an emotional moment after your family left for the day, and then managed to continue with your routine. Can you try to reflect on what could have triggered the crying episode? Did something specific happen prior to that or was it an overwhelming feeling in general? Understanding this can help us explore coping strategies.
It sounds like you experienced an intense fear or panic when you got into the car, and it was overwhelming to the point that you thought you were having a heart attack. I can imagine how scary that must be. Can you tell me if you have experienced similar situations before or if there is any specific event that triggered this episode? Understanding what may be causing these feelings can help us work on coping strategies to manage them.
It sounds like you experienced a form of emotional abuse from your partner, and as a result, you suppressed your feelings to cope with it. Suppressed emotions can have adverse effects on mental health. How has this affected your current relationships and emotional expression?
It's understandable that you feel angry when faced with criticism, even if it's presented as a joke. It's important not to suppress those feelings, as it might lead to more issues down the line. Can you think of any healthier ways to express or cope with your anger in such situations?
It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of anxiety and panic, which is understandably affecting your well-being. In our future sessions, we'll talk about ways to manage these attacks and explore the reasons for your anxiety. For now, it's important to focus on your mental health and remember that we're in this together to help you overcome this challenging time.
I'm glad you were able to apply what we discussed last week and express your feelings to your boss. It's essential to stand up for yourself and communicate your emotions in a constructive way. It seems like your boss recognized his behavior and calmed down, which is a positive outcome. How do you feel about your ability to assert yourself and handle similar situations in the future?
It's great to hear that you took control of the situation and that you're becoming more aware of your emotions. Are you saying that you could actually notice when you're starting to simmer, take it in, stuff it down? Keep practicing this self-awareness and use it to help you work through any challenging situations.
It sounds like you're making progress in finding a middle ground between bottling up your emotions and exploding or withdrawing from challenging situations. Can you think of any other instances when this has occurred?
As a counsellor, I'm glad to hear that you've found a way to change the negative internal voice into something more positive using your own voice. This shows progress in managing your thoughts and emotions. Are there specific techniques or strategies you've used to make this shift in your internal voice?
I understand that you had a strong reaction to the situation and felt the need to release your tension by yelling. Instead of letting it build up or exploding, you can try calmly expressing your feelings, concerns, and opinions. You can also practice deep breathing or relaxation techniques to help manage your emotions. What specific situations led to this feeling, and how can we work together to explore healthier ways to communicate and cope with emotions?
It's important to communicate your feelings, but it can be difficult when the other person responds with blame. It's not fair for them to make you feel guilty. You can try explaining your feelings using 'I' statements to avoid sounding accusatory, and possibly ask them open-ended questions to understand more about their behavior. Do you have any specific instances in which they ignored you that we could analyze to find better ways of communicating?
It's good to know that you tried to apply the skills we've discussed during a challenging situation. Can you please tell me more about how you handled the situation with the angry clients and what specific skills you used to navigate through the problem?
I'm sorry to hear that you had to deal with such a stressful situation at work. How did you feel when your boss yelled at you? And do you think there's room for communication to clarify the situation and ensure that everyone understands the context of the problem?
I understand the situation you're facing, and I appreciate your willingness to learn relaxation techniques. Let's take a moment now to practice some breathing exercises. Please sit back, get as comfortable as possible, and close your eyes. Follow my guidance, and this will give you a sense of how you can gain control over your breathing and break the vicious cycle.
Of course, let's dive deeper into that situation with Lizzie. I'd like you to focus on the feelings and thoughts you had at each point during that experience. As we do this, remember to take slow, deep breaths to maintain a sense of calmness. We will explore the cognitive aspect of your panic attacks and work on breaking the vicious cycle of tenseness that contributes to them.
I understand that you feel attacked and confused since you believe you didn't do anything wrong. Can you give me more context about your relationship with this person and why she might have felt her privacy was invaded? It's important to consider both sides of the situation in order to better understand each other's perspective.
I'm sorry that you're feeling this way about yourself. It sounds like the argument has triggered some strong emotions and negative thoughts about yourself. Let's try to understand which aspects of the situation might be causing these feelings. Can you tell me more about the specific situation or interaction that led to the argument and these thoughts?
It's possible that your partner might be having a hard time adjusting to your new independence. As your counsellor, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about the situation. Share your feelings about the tension, and ask him if there's anything that's bothering him about your new job. This will help both of you understand each other's perspective and find ways to support each other.
It's understandable that you feel frustrated and upset when your partner belittles your work. It's important to have a conversation and express your feelings about this situation with him. Let him know that his words are hurtful and discouraging, making your efforts feel undervalued. Ask him if there's a reason he feels the need to make such comments, and work towards resolving the issue together while promoting mutual respect.
It sounds like you've faced criticism from important figures in your life, which must be difficult to endure. Can you tell me more about how their comments have affected you emotionally? It's important to understand the impact of their actions to facilitate healing and help handle future situations more effectively.
It sounds like you have gone through a challenging experience with this person. It's important to remember that their negative behavior reflects upon them, not upon you. Don't let this person's behavior define your self-worth or limit your abilities. Consider surrounding yourself with positive, supportive people and seek advice from those who believe in you. An additional question: What steps have you taken so far to cope with this situation?
It's good to hear that you haven't had any panic attacks this week. However, it's concerning that you're feeling more depressed. Can you share more about the things you've been thinking about that are making you feel terrible? It might help us understand the situation better and explore possible solutions together.
It's great to hear that you were able to bring some relief to yourself by acknowledging that it wasn't your fault. It's important to remind ourselves that we can't control everything, and taking responsibility for what we can control can help reduce stress and anxiety. Keep practicing this self-compassion and reassurance when needed. Can you think of any other situations in which you'd like to remind yourself that you're not at fault?
It's great to hear that you are becoming more aware of your feelings and reactions. Being able to catch yourself in those moments and remind yourself that it's not your fault is a significant step towards managing your emotions. Keep practicing this technique, and see if you can apply it in other situations as well to continue improving your emotional regulation.

It's important to recognize and appreciate the instrumental actions you've taken to bring about this positive change. Keep practicing this method, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance or have any concerns.
It's important to acknowledge this change in your relationship and try to find solutions. Can you think of specific situations or causes that might have contributed to this? Discussing your concerns with Patrick might help in finding ways to improve your relationship and understand each other's needs better.
It sounds like work might be a significant source of stress for you. Could you share more information about what specifically at work is causing tension, and how it's affecting your daily life?
I can understand how that situation must have been distressing for you. It's important for us to identify these situations that trigger anxiety for you, so we can address them effectively. Would you like to share more about similar incidents that caused the same feelings of anxiety and tension? We can then work together on finding ways to break this vicious cycle and manage your anxiety better.
It sounds like you were experiencing a lot of frustration and self-doubt in that moment. It's normal to feel this way when faced with challenging situations in our family relationships. It's important to remember that you cannot control everything and it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Take a deep breath and try to focus on what you can do to improve the situation. Remember, self-compassion is vital in managing difficult emotions. What specific event or circumstance in her room led to these feelings?
It sounds like you experienced a panic attack. When people have panic attacks, they tend to breathe in quickly and exhale out, which is called hyperventilation. This can make you feel more tense and cause symptoms like hot and cold flashes, and feelings of tingling. It’s important to recognize these symptoms and try to manage your breathing in such situations. 
It's natural to feel a range of emotions during the grieving process. I noticed that you had the courage to express your emotions directly to your husband. Do you think finding a healthier way to express these feelings or finding alternative ways to grieve for your mom could help you manage your emotions better?
It can be surprising how sometimes arguments or conflicts can lead to positive outcomes. Maybe that interaction allowed both of you to express your feelings, which helped clear the air and led to a better understanding of each other. It's important to note that it might not always be the case, so being mindful of communication patterns and finding healthy ways to express emotions can help strengthen the relationship. Do you often find such situations where resolving conflicts lead to a better connection with your partner?
It sounds like you usually keep your negative emotions bottled up, but on this occasion, you expressed them towards someone else. It's normal for emotions to come out eventually, but finding healthy ways to express them is important. Can you think of a specific situation that led to this outburst, or was it a buildup of various emotions?
It's understandable to feel angry and anxious in certain situations. It's important to recognize those feelings and find healthy ways to express and deal with them. Can you recall what specifically triggered these emotions at that time?
As a counsellor, my role is to provide guidance and support, rather than promote the use of certain substances or engage in personal experiences. It's important to remember that medication should be prescribed by a healthcare professional based on individual needs. I encourage you to discuss your concerns and options with your doctor and focus on finding a treatment plan that works best for you.
It's perfectly normal to feel pressure to try new things, especially when others around you are encouraging it. However, it's important to stay true to your values and beliefs. You don't need to engage in drug use to connect with others or be creative. If you're concerned about fitting in, try engaging with people who share your interests and values. Remember, it's okay to say no and set boundaries when it comes to your personal choices.
I understand that it can be challenging to feel heard by your parent, especially when they're constantly worrying about you. Instead of trying to change your mom, consider focusing on making positive changes in yourself, or at least conveying that you are making progress. Once she sees this, she might become more receptive to listening and understanding your perspective. Remember, the key to improving communication often lies in how we present ourselves.
As a counsellor, I appreciate your sharing your thoughts about how rap music impacts you and the metaphor you used to describe its effect. It's interesting how music can evoke strong emotions and create a sense of truth for some people. I'm glad you found a way to articulate your feelings, and I will consider using your metaphor while discussing similar feelings with other clients, of course giving you credit for it. Remember, everyone's perception of truth is unique, and your opinion is just as valuable as anyone else's.
It's great to hear that you have found an activity that brings life and energy back into you. The fact that rapping makes you feel alive indicates its positive impact on your mental state. Is there any specific reason why you have been feeling lifeless lately or any particular stressor or issue that has contributed to this feeling?
I understand that your thoughts can be overwhelming at times, and it's natural to feel concerned about the world. Remember that you are the engineer of your thoughts, and it's up to you to channel them towards positive actions. It's okay to take breaks from the constant thinking and come back when you're ready. Do you engage in any activities to help quiet your mind or manage the overwhelming feelings?
I'm glad that you feel comfortable during our sessions and that the counseling is helpful. It's completely natural to find it challenging to express yourself sometimes. As your counsellor, I encourage you to take your time and not worry about saying the perfect thing. The more you engage in conversations, the easier it will become to share your thoughts and feelings. Is there anything specific you would like to discuss or focus on?
It's great to see you expressing your feelings and experiences through creative outlets like rap music. As a counsellor, I encourage you to explore this idea of creating a psychiatric rap to express your journey with mental health.

Another strategy is carrying a small notepad with you to jot down any thoughts you want to remember. This way, you'll be able to let go of the thought and return to what's currently happening.

It's important to understand that people have the right to their opinions and actions, even if they're wrong. Your self-worth should not be dependent on whether others listen to you or agree with you. Remember, your feelings are part of your cognition, but they don't necessarily prove anything. It's not about being inefficient; you cannot control others' actions. Focus on what you can control, like your own behavior and reactions to these situations, and try not to let others' actions define your worth.
It's important to understand that your 'youness' - your personality, essence, and being - has millions of aspects, with both good and bad qualities. You might be inefficient in some situations, but it doesn't mean you're totally inefficient. No one is perfect. Recognize the areas of your life where you're efficient and embrace the complexity of your being.
It sounds like you're struggling with a need to control others in your life. This can be difficult not only for you but also for those around you.

It's normal to feel frustrated when things are out of your control, but getting angry at uncontrollable people may not be helpful. Try to identify what thoughts are making you feel angry at them. It's important to recognize that we can't control others, and focus on how to manage your emotions and reactions in these situations.
It's understandable that you may feel the need to control your friends, but it's important to remember that everyone has the right to make their own choices. It's not necessarily a reflection of your self-worth if you're unable to control them. Instead of focusing on controlling others, try to work on your own emotions, such as anger. Why do you believe it's essential for you to control them? And remember, they have a right to be wrong and uncontrollable, just as you have the right to your emotions and opinions.
It's important to separate your actions from who you are as a person. It's okay to acknowledge that your behavior in certain situations may not have been the best, but that doesn't make you a bad person. You can work towards improving your reactions, but trying to control everything and everyone is not practical. It's better to focus on what you can control, like your own actions and responses. In situations where things feel out of control, remind yourself that it's okay not to have full control and try to keep a rational perspective. Practice accepting yourself, even when things don't go as planned.
It's great that you were able to shift your perspective and realize that it's not about you or your worth, but your behavior in the situation. You're doing a good job of controlling your emotional feelings. Now, try practicing this mindset daily for about 30 days to internalize this new way of thinking and feeling less angry and frustrated.
That sounds like a good plan to help you stay consistent with your daily practice of rational emotive imagery. By using rewards and consequences, you can create an external motivation to make sure you keep up with your commitment for 30 days. Just make sure to give yourself credit for the progress you make and don't be too hard on yourself if a slip-up happens occasionally.

It's interesting that you had this light-hearted thought in our session, sometimes humor can be a way for us to connect and feel more comfortable. Are there any specific reasons you thought about us switching outfits or was it just a spontaneous idea?
It's important to feel comfortable in the clothes you wear, so if you don't feel confident in that style, that's perfectly fine. You can explore other styles and find what works best for you. If, however, you're curious about trying the style, you could always give it a try in a low-pressure environment to see if it grows on you.

It's good that you've recognized the connection between your environment and your actions. While moving to a better neighborhood might be helpful, it's also important to work on your own personal development. Regarding your style, if you aren't willing to change it completely, you could consider making small, subtle changes that still express your identity but don't lead to negative assumptions. Is there any specific aspect of your life you'd like to focus on improving?
I understand your concerns about the challenges you may face in different neighborhoods. It's true that each community is unique and some issues might be present everywhere.

It's possible that your partner is simply being thoughtful during these conversations and needs time to process the information you're sharing with him.

It's understandable that you may feel unsure about your friend's intentions to think about the situation.

This might give you a better sense of his genuine engagement on the matter.
I understand your concern. One philosophy is that if something isn't broken right now, we won't fix it. However, another approach believes that there's always room for improvement.

For example, are you willing to face some temporary discomfort for potential long-term growth?
It's great to hear that you have a strong relationship with your friend. Since the issue doesn't seem significant, you may want to consider discussing the matter openly with him to avoid any potential misunderstandings.

Can you identify any specific emotions or thoughts that keep coming up for you when you think about forgiving him?

Additionally, you can try deep breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques to better manage your emotions. Is there any specific situation that you'd like more guidance on improving patience?
That does sound frustrating. You could consider trying a technique to address this issue at work.

It sounds like you're able to discuss your past experiences from a detached perspective, but you find it difficult to delve into the emotions that come with those memories.

It's understandable that letting go of control can be challenging, especially when it comes to sharing personal feelings and experiences.

It might be worthwhile to be patient and explore other ways to approach the situation, while still taking care of yourself and setting boundaries against any continued abuse.
As a counsellor, I understand that you desire an apology from your son, and it's normal to want acknowledgment and reconciliation in relationships. However, it's important to manage expectations and focus on communicating your feelings to your son. If you could have a conversation with him about how you feel, how would you approach it?
I'm glad you took the initiative to reach out and have a conversation with your son. It's normal to feel mixed emotions, especially when discussing sensitive topics such as divorce.

It might also help to give your son some time to process the conversation, and you can both revisit it later with a better understanding of each other's perspectives.
I understand that you're seeking peace of mind and you might not have found what you needed in our last session. What I hear is that you want to dive deeper into your feelings and better understand the problem regarding your father.

It's completely normal to have different expectations, and it's understandable that you might struggle with conflicting feelings about your children. It seems like you are aware of the importance of acceptance and unconditional love but find it difficult to practice in your situation. It's great that you are open to talking about it, as this can be an important step in resolving your feelings. You may want to actively work on reevaluating your expectations and try to remind yourself that everyone's path is different, and ultimately the most important thing is their happiness and well-being.
It sounds like you're disappointed that your children didn't learn the work ethic and values you hoped they would, and now you're faced with the challenge of whether to support them financially. It's important to remember that each person's path is different, and it's not necessarily a reflection on your role as a parent. You mentioned your father not supporting you financially - how did that shape your outlook on life and could it have been beneficial in some ways? Reflecting on this might help you better understand your current situation and find a balance between your expectations and the needs of your children.
I appreciate your willingness to discuss this issue, even though it might be difficult for you. It's completely normal to feel hesitant about opening up.

Perhaps consider approaching the conversation with an open mind and willingness to listen, so that it doesn't turn into a confrontation. It's important to remember that appreciation and feeling valued are essential in any relationship, and discussing your feelings might help you find a sense of mutual understanding and support.
It's understandable that you're feeling this way, but it's important to address these concerns.

It's possible that they might have positive feedback to share, so don't assume it will be only negative. Working on this together can help you find a more comfortable path forward.
It's important to find peace within yourself and recognize that your children's choices are their own. Having expectations can lead to disappointments, but it's up to you to decide how to handle those feelings. For me, not having expectations for my children helps me to not get disappointed when they don't perform. It might be helpful to have a conversation with your other children about your feelings, as it could provide a better sense of understanding and closure.
It's great that you're considering reconnecting with your oldest son. Sometimes we need to accept and live with what we can have in our relationships. Try to find common ground and develop a bond with him, keeping in mind that it may not be the ideal relationship you envisioned, but it's a step towards a stronger connection.
It seems that you have mixed feelings about how your father raised you and worry about potentially repeating certain patterns with your own children. It's important to recognize and appreciate your father's good qualities while learning from areas where he might have fallen short. Can you think of specific ways you could set higher expectations for your children while still maintaining a nurturing and supportive environment?
It seems like you have a couple of options here - either find a way to be at peace with your situation or consider discussing it with your sons. Since this is the first time you've talked about it, maybe we need some more conversations to help you think about what it would be like having this discussion with your sons. It's important to weigh the potential benefits of sharing your thoughts against any possible consequences.
It's important to recognize that substituting one addiction for another may not be the best solution, as it can bring its own set of difficulties. Instead of turning to alcohol, consider exploring alternative healthy coping mechanisms to deal with stress and challenges. If you're concerned about how these substances are affecting your work, it's crucial to address these issues and seek support or treatment to improve your well-being.
It's great that you want to engage in sports! If organizing a sports club or finding someone to participate with is challenging, you might consider activities like going for a walk with a coworker after work. This way, you can gradually improve your fitness and lung health, and it can be a more manageable starting point than jumping straight into team sports.
It sounds like you're thinking about some practical ways to improve both your physical fitness and work relationships. Joining a team sport could be a long-term goal, but starting with walking and staying late at the office can give you immediate results. Remember, you don't need to do this every night - just finding a balance that works for you and your schedule is important.
It seems like using substances has become a coping mechanism for you in certain situations. Can you share some reasons or specific triggers that lead you to get stoned before going there?

Going for coffee, dinner, or a movie can also help in distracting yourself from smoking.

Keep exploring different options to find what works best for you.
It's great that you're considering different options to address the issue. Taking time off and going away could help interrupt the pattern and shake things up. It might provide a fresh perspective and help you regain balance in your life. Remember, it's essential to explore all possible solutions and choose what seems best for your well-being.
It's important to prioritize changes that you feel confident about making and that will have a positive impact on your life. I suggest reviewing the list together with your partner, David, since it seems like you both have dynamic decision-making. From there, identify one or two items that you both feel ready to tackle and remove the ones that might not be feasible at this stage. Remember, it's better to focus on a few manageable steps rather than overwhelming yourself with too many changes at once.
It sounds like you began using substances to cope with stress and anxiety during your teenage years, and this coping mechanism continued into your university years.

It seems like you are experiencing a lot of discomfort and uncertainty in your life right now.

It's important to continue recognizing and celebrating these improvements, as they showcase your ability to make positive choices. Remember to reflect on the strategies we discussed and reach out if needed, but overall, I'm happy with the progress you've made.
I'm glad to hear that you have reached a point where you feel like you can choose and that David has been supportive of your decision.

It's great that you've been trying the breathing strategies to manage your anxiety. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to feel challenged during this process. Share your experience with your partner so that he can understand and support you better, and continue practicing the strategies we discussed. Keep believing in yourself and let's pick up from where we left next week.
That might be a bit unrealistic, but it seems like you got absorbed in something that entertained you, interested you, and distracted you from needing to smoke. Perhaps you can incorporate more engaging activities into your daily routine to prevent the urge to smoke.

As your counsellor, I can assure you that growing plants in general is not considered a serious issue. However, if you are growing something that is specifically against the law, then it's important to consider the consequences.

Just understand that if you are involved in any illegal activities, disclosing them to me might change the dynamics of our conversation.

It's important to recognize patterns and habits related to substance use. Can you tell me about any specific triggers or stressors that led to an increase in your usage over time?
It seems like you would like to gain independence and make changes on your own, which is a reasonable and valid goal. I suggest discussing with David your desire to make changes without his support and addressing your concerns about his smoking habits. It's important to also consider sharing information about your panic attacks if it would help your situation. Remember to provide reassurance that these issues are separate from your relationship and not meant to take you away from him.
It seems like a pretty big thing to be carrying on your own, with your intimate partner not knowing. This could be a huge responsibility or perhaps even a burden for you. Can you share more about the reasons that make you hesitate to open up to your partner?
It's understandable that being around your boyfriend and his friends, who are heavy smokers, might influence your own smoking habits. It can be challenging to make a change in behavior like this, especially when it's a shared activity with your partner and friends. Can you think of any strategies or alternative activities you could engage in to help reduce your smoking?
It sounds like your partner needs to be under the influence of substances to open up and communicate. It's important to consider if this pattern is healthy for your relationship and if there are alternative ways to improve communication.

Thank you for sharing that information. It seems like your marijuana use increased during your time at University and started to serve multiple purposes like helping you sleep and study. It's important to consider the impact this might be having on your overall well-being and if there are alternative ways to cope with stress or sleep issues. Have you tried exploring other coping mechanisms or considered reaching out for professional help to address any concerns related to your marijuana use?
It seems that smoking has served as a coping mechanism for relaxation and sleep for you. It's been a long-standing pattern in your life. Have you considered exploring alternative ways to unwind and manage stress that could potentially be healthier and more sustainable in the long run?
It sounds like you made some progress by smoking only one, but had a difficult conversation with David. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your loved ones. Can you tell me more about your relationship with David and how his reaction affected you?
It's understandable that you feel embarrassed about your panic attacks, and it's natural to have a mixed first week while making big changes. It's important to focus on your progress and not view yourself as a failure. To address your fear of opening up to your partner about your panic attacks, let's discuss how you could approach the conversation and feel less shy and embarrassed. Remember, you've made progress before and can do it again. Why do you think you are afraid to tell your partner about your panic attacks?
It's great to hear that you've gained insight from your past experiences and used them to improve your communication with David. It's important to remember that sometimes setbacks can teach us valuable lessons and contribute to positive change. As you continue to grow and face challenges, remember this experience and use it to learn and adapt. Keep up the good work, and remember that progress may not be linear, but you're on the right path.
I'm glad to have been part of your journey, and I wish you well. Remember, the door is always open if you need help in the future. Just keep doing what you're doing. You've been very successful. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before moving forward?
It's understandable that you're concerned about your partner's understanding. You can try explaining to them like we discussed, and if you think it's helpful, I can suggest inviting them to a session with us. Regarding work, take it one step at a time and practice implementing the coping strategies. Remember, progress may be slow but it's important to keep trying.
It's understandable that you feel apprehensive about making changes, but it's great that you're determined to address your smoking habit.

We'll look at those together and keep moving forward.
It's great to hear that you didn't smoke, even if it wasn't part of the plan. Sometimes being too tired can help with overcoming urges to indulge in unhealthy habits.

It's great to hear that you had a good time with your coworker. Going out and enjoying social interactions is important for our mental health. Can you think of any other activities you might want to do with friends or coworkers in the future to continue building connections?
As a counsellor, I would acknowledge that it's not easy to cope with anxiety every day, and it's understandable that you found relief through smoking marijuana. However, it's important to remember that relying on substances to manage anxiety can lead to dependence and other negative consequences. Have you considered exploring healthier coping strategies or talking to a professional about your anxiety?
It's interesting that you've noticed the change in the effect of cannabis on your focus and how you're comparing yourself to your coworkers who don't smoke. It's natural to question our habits and choices, especially when we see others living without them. Have you thought about discussing your concerns with your boyfriend and friends, and maybe explore other ways to find focus and humor in your life?
It's good that you're trying different strategies to cut back on smoking. Drinking alcohol might not be the healthiest option, but let's not evaluate it now. Instead, try focusing on engaging in sports or other structured activities straight after work for one or two nights a week. Remember, this process is trial and error, so if a strategy doesn't work, we can always try something else.
It sounds like staying with your sister, who doesn't smoke, could be a helpful strategy in avoiding smoking triggers at home with David. Are there any other positive habits or activities you could engage in while staying with your sister to reinforce your decision to quit smoking?
It's great that you're considering your options for cannabis use. It sounds like you're open to cutting back, especially during the week to improve your work performance. Part of our work together will be teaching you other ways to manage your anxiety, which can help you make better choices about your cannabis use. So, would you like to focus on cutting back your use during the week for now?

I suggest we explore together if the cannabis use is contributing to your concentration and punctuality issues at work and try to find healthier ways to manage and cope with your anxieties. It's important to address these concerns before they have a greater impact on your work and personal life.
As a counsellor, I understand that there haven't been any significant changes in your situation, and that's okay - we didn't expect that at this stage.

We'll work together to make a plan that feels clear and achievable for you.

It's good to see that you're taking steps to address your work situation, and trying new things to build a better work-life balance. As for discussing your panic attacks with David, it's natural to feel embarrassed or worried about sharing such information, but maintaining open communication in any relationship is crucial.

Acknowledging your feelings and opening up about your experiences is an important step towards moving forward.
It's great that you're open to working on this concern. I'd like you to do an exercise before our next session.

Also, consider discussing your concerns with your supervisors to seek possible improvements in your working relationship.
I understand that your preference is strong, but it's important to recognize that people have the right to make their own choices. It isn't necessarily written or heard anywhere that they must follow your preference. Instead, try to accept and respect others' choices, even if they differ from yours.

However, to deal with the intimidation from your supervisors, you could try assertive communication and set boundaries.

It's important to separate people's actions from their worth as individuals. It's okay to dislike their actions, but try not to label them as bad people. First, work on managing your feelings of intimidation and anger. Once you feel more in control of your emotions, consider whether there's any practical approach you can take to help them understand the situation better or improve their decision-making process. Remember, even supervisors can change, but it starts with our own responses and perspectives.
I hear your concerns about feeling rejected and how this imagined scenario affects you emotionally. Remember, it's important to separate people's actions from their value as individuals. You can disagree with their behavior, but refrain from labeling them as 'bad.' By focusing on their actions instead of their character, you may be able to help them change. Try practicing rational emotive imagery, vividly imagining the worst possible scenario, and then disputing irrational, dysfunctional beliefs you have about it. This can help you cope with your feelings of rejection and develop a healthier mindset.

Try changing your perspective and practicing empathy to better understand their actions.
It's important to acknowledge that feeling intimidated can be a natural response to certain situations. However, it becomes unhelpful when it leads to anger and frustration. Instead of focusing on the behavior of others, which you can't control, try working on your own reaction to these situations. You might still feel sorry or displeased by their behavior, but you can learn to not let it intimidate you or make you angry. Remember, it's okay to be non-intimidatable and conserve your energy for more important things.
First, accept that you're feeling intimidated and recognize that it's not a reflection of your worth. Tell yourself, 'It's bad and stupid for me to be intimidated, but right now that's the way I am and I'm not a louse, a worm, or a loser for being intimidated. But it's wrong.' Then, focus on the intimidators and realize that they should respect you and not try to intimidate you. Say to yourself, 'I refuse to be intimidated.' Consider if there is anything practical you can do to change their behavior or reduce their impact on you.

Remember that our past experiences can influence our future choices, but they don't have to define us.

It's understandable that the trauma and the consequences have affected you and your community.

Can you think of any strategies to manage your frustration in those situations?
It's interesting that you recognize your perfectionism as a factor in your anger. Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword, where it motivates us to achieve high standards but also causes emotional distress when things aren't perfect. Let's explore ways to manage your perfectionism and understand how it's impacting your anger. Can you share an example of a situation where your perfectionism led to anger?
It sounds like perfectionism is at the root of your anger. The constant pressure to be perfect can be overwhelming, making it difficult to ever feel satisfied with your achievements. To help you manage your anger, we'll need to address your perfectionism and understand why it matters so much to you. Have you noticed any specific situations or factors that intensify your need to be perfect?
It's important to realize that perfectionism can be detrimental to your overall well-being and performance. Instead, strive for progress and acknowledge your accomplishments along the way. When you catch yourself getting angry, take a step back and breathe, remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and focus on what you can learn from the situation. Why do you think you expect perfection from yourself in every game?
I understand that you have a strong drive to perform well and avoid showing any weakness.

Keep in mind, 100 percent would be a perfect day, and 0 percent would be a total failure.

Learning from our mistakes helps us improve and grow. Instead of focusing on being perfect, try setting more realistic goals for yourself and appreciate the progress you make along the way. Remember, it is not about never failing; it's about learning and growing from those experiences.

Yes, nicotine can indeed impact your mood as it is a stimulant. It's great that you're aware of the need to quit smoking. Improving your health by quitting can help your mood and overall well-being. Do you have any specific plans or strategies for quitting smoking?

It's possible that you may not immediately notice the effects of smoking on your physical performance, but it can still have long-term consequences. Have you considered trying any support resources or strategies to help you quit?
As a counsellor, I understand that quitting smoking can be a challenging process, especially when you have mixed feelings about it. It might be helpful to focus on the positive aspects of quitting, such as improved physical performance, and explore the reasons why you like smoking to better handle those cravings.

It's true that changing the way you think can be challenging, but it's also one of the main techniques that psychologists use to help people manage their anger better. Be patient with yourself and consider working with a mental health professional to learn strategies to modify your thought patterns and improve your anger management.
It seems you're experiencing difficulty with perfectionism and adjusting your mindset. It can be challenging to shift our thought patterns. Perhaps you could practice thinking that it doesn't matter, slowly integrating this perspective into your life. Remember, it's okay not to be perfect and nobody is. Do you have any specific situations where this mindset has caused you problems?
It's great that you're open to changing your thinking. However, it can be challenging to change our thoughts, especially if they've been with us for a long time.

Remember, progress is more important than perfection. Additionally, you can seek support from a mental health professional who can guide through this process.
I understand changing thought patterns can be challenging. Instead of focusing solely on the game, let's try exploring some alternative strategies, such as practicing mindfulness or identifying and reframing negative thoughts. When you're ready, we can discuss your experience with these techniques and make adjustments as needed.
It's great that you've noticed some improvement after taking breaks. Taking time off can indeed help you gain a fresh perspective and might even improve your performance. Exploring a new hobby can also be a good idea since it can provide you with a mental break and foster creativity. Remember, balance is key in life, so taking breaks or engaging in different activities can contribute to your overall well-being.

I understand that can be tough, but try to find a balance and consider talking to your stepmom or another trusted adult about the shifts you're experiencing.
It's understandable that managing school, sports, and personal life can be challenging and lead to stress. It might be helpful for you to identify the factors influencing your behaviors when you're stressed.

Does any specific situation or incident come to your mind where you faced severe stress and had difficulty handling it?
It seems like you're struggling with feelings of not being accepted or good enough, and this has caused you to feel angry, sad, and disappointed.

I understand that your feelings can vary depending on the day and situation. It's important to acknowledge that we can't change certain aspects of our life, such as your parents' divorce and moving from Utah.

This, combined with your mother's busy schedule, might have contributed to your feelings of loneliness and being less of a priority. Can you identify any specific events or situations that reinforced these beliefs about yourself?
Yes, it definitely makes sense. While I cannot take away the roots of your negative experiences, what I would like to do is help you add more positive roots to your life. A lot of the times, we tend to focus only on what's gone wrong, but by revising our thoughts and creating more balanced ones, such as replacing 'I'm not good enough' with a more positive statement, you can eventually influence your actions in a healthier way.

I'm looking forward to seeing you at our next appointment and continuing our work together. If you have any concerns or questions before then, please feel free to reach out.
It's important to recognize that our emotions can influence our behaviors, as you've mentioned.

Can you identify any specific triggers or situations that lead to you feeling this anger or sadness?
It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of anger and guilt in response to your behaviors.

Is there anything in particular that you're struggling with when trying to reach out to new people?
It seems that your obsession with this person may be preventing you from moving forward in your life. However, constantly thinking about someone doesn't necessarily mean you're still in love with them.

It's understandable that you're concerned about repeating past patterns. Taking things slower and getting to know someone better before becoming involved is a reasonable strategy. However, it's important to also analyze the underlying reasons behind these patterns, such as any unmet emotional needs or unresolved past experiences. I wonder if you have considered any strategies or support systems to ensure you maintain this new approach in your future relationships?
It's great that you're becoming more aware and cautious of red flags in relationships. It's possible that holding onto Sylvester is a way to prevent yourself from quickly entering new relationships, but it's also important to explore your pattern of trying to rescue partners. Reflect on why you tend to choose people who need saving, and work on setting boundaries and improving your own well-being before entering new relationships.
As a counsellor, it's important to understand that our role is to guide and support clients, not to fix their problems for them.

From your description, it seems that you are struggling with handling your emotions effectively and maintaining a healthy balance between being alone and seeking support from others. It's alright to want some alone time, but self-help groups can provide valuable support and help you regain your confidence. As for letting go of past relationships, it's a process that takes time and effort. In therapy, your primary focus should be your own well-being and growth, not pleasing others. Are there specific concerns or challenges you've faced while trying to seek help or express your emotions?
It's important to recognize the patterns in your relationships and learn healthier ways to handle them. As your counsellor, I can help you with psychoeducation to teach you the necessary skills for building more positive connections and recognizing when someone truly loves you.

It's great to learn about your background and beliefs. When I work with clients, I value the education and understanding I gain from their diverse cultures, which helps me adapt my approach accordingly.

I believe that every therapist should be open to learning, evolving, and adapting their methods based on the unique needs of each client.
As a counsellor, I understand your concern. But remember that those videotaped sessions usually show the best moments, and don't include any challenges or difficulties the counsellors might face.

And keep in mind, nobody is perfect, and we all have our unique strengths and areas of growth. Is there any particular skill or area that you feel you're struggling With?

If you feel unsure about any of my insights or suggestions, please feel free to voice your concerns or ask for clarification.
I appreciate your observations, and I understand that it might be difficult to label my counseling style. My approach is to use different techniques and strategies tailored to your needs and circumstances rather than strictly adhering to one specific therapy model. My ultimate goal is to support and guide you in discovering and achieving your desires. If you have any concerns, please let me know.
As a counsellor, I understand that it can be difficult for those new to therapy to grasp the complexities of the process. It's important to acknowledge that therapy doesn't always provide concrete answers and the outcomes can be different from what we expect. It's not always about the specific techniques or interventions, but more about the connection and deeper understanding developed during therapy. It's important to be patient and open to growth during the process. Can you share more about your expectations from therapy?

Can you think of any activities or hobbies that may help you meet new people and develop a sense of belonging, so you can gradually overcome the loneliness?
It seems that your thoughts about Sylvester are making it difficult for you to focus on yourself and your own goals. This could be because holding onto him provides some comfort in the face of loneliness.

Are there any specific goals you have in mind that you'd like to work on?
It's possible that you might be experiencing some fear or insecurity regarding the opportunities you're avoiding, and using your boyfriend as a safety net.

Keep embracing these qualities to continue your personal development, and thank you for sharing your gratitude.
As a counsellor, I agree that starting with a theory that your mentor or supervisor recommends is a good starting point. However, it's essential to keep in mind that it may not be the perfect fit for you and could evolve as you learn and grow in your practice. Remember, the purpose of a theory is to guide and inform your therapeutic approach, and it's normal for therapists to adapt their methods over time.

It sounds like being able to vent to her has helped you process and release some of the stress and emotions you've been experiencing. Is there something specific that's causing you the most stress lately?
It's important to recognize that breaking free from a destructive relationship is not an easy task, but your therapist is providing helpful tools such as the charts to help you see the differences between what you want and what your current situation is. The feeling of addiction could be an indication of codependency, which can be addressed in therapy. Remain diligent in your sessions and actively work on your personal growth and self-awareness. Are there any specific strategies or coping mechanisms that you've found helpful in your attempts to create distance in this relationship?
It's common for people to experience a conflict between their thoughts and emotions. Your mind might be telling you one thing, while your emotions pull you in a different direction. This can be confusing and challenging to navigate. It's important to acknowledge both your thoughts and feelings, and try to find a balance between them. Reflect on your values and long-term goals, and consider discussing your concerns with someone you trust or a professional counsellor for guidance.
It does seem sad that there was potential in your relationship with Sylvester, but both of you were not able to make it work. In some ways, he was really afraid of you and the relationship, and did what he could to sabotage it. As we have limited time left, I want you to reflect on your feelings and thoughts when you drive home today.
It's great that you're taking these insights with you. In the next session with your counselor, discuss ways to develop a positive self-image while being alone and explore other areas that might help you in personal growth.

How has the breakup impacted your daily life and what kind of support do you have around you?
It's understandable that you're feeling stressed due to your children leaving and job transition. It can be difficult to adapt to new situations and face uncertainties. But, remember that change can also bring growth and new opportunities. Try focusing on ways to manage stress, such as exercise, connecting with friends, or finding new interests.

It's understandable that you might feel overwhelmed when observing the use of multiple theories in counseling sessions. However, it's important to remember that as a beginner, you don't have to master all of these approaches at once.

It takes time to become proficient, so be patient with yourself and embrace the learning process.
It's great that you're exploring relaxation techniques but finding the right one can take time and experimentation. I would recommend focusing on one technique at a time and give it some time to see if it's effective for you.

If you're still having difficulty finding the right one, consider seeking a professional's assistance who can tailor a relaxation strategy specifically for your needs.

Have you considered seeking support or trying out any coping strategies to help with your situation?
As a counsellor, I understand that you've been struggling with feelings of low self-worth and dependence on a male partner for validation. From a feminist perspective, it's important to recognize your inherent worth as an individual, separate from any relationship.

Do you have any specific experiences that might have led you to form these beliefs?

Can you tell me more about the actions you have taken to avoid being alone?
It's important to have good communication and trust with your therapist for effective therapy. I'd like to know more about your experiences with your current therapist and how it differs from your experiences with others.

Remember, it's always an option to consider seeking help from another therapist if you feel it would be more beneficial for you.
It's important for counselors and therapists to develop not only their professional skills but also themselves as individuals. The changes we promote in others occur not just because of what we're doing, but who we are. Therefore, I encourage junior counselors and therapists to focus on personal growth and self-awareness, striving to practice what they preach in their own lives. This will help them connect with clients on a deeper level and discover the freedom and space that exists beyond traditional methods.

As a counsellor, I believe that my integrative approach shares similarities with Allen Ivey's model in terms of our thought processes. However, our methods might look different in implementation, as my approach focuses on fluidity and personalization for each client's unique needs, while Ivey emphasizes specific skills, techniques, and cultural considerations. In either approach, we aim to be culturally sensitive and respond to cultural factors that affect our clients, but the specific techniques or balance of how we integrate culture might vary from case to case.
As a counsellor, I completely agree with your observation. The culture of an individual is crucial in understanding their background, values, and experiences. It enables me to tailor my counselling approach effectively to meet your needs.

Acknowledging these feelings and trying to work on them can help you build resilience and improve your well-being. It is also important to maintain healthy emotional boundaries in your relationships, which can prevent emotional exhaustion and protect your mental health.

I understand that it can be challenging and frightening to open up and be vulnerable, especially when it involves trusting someone else with your feelings and experiences. It's indeed a big risk, but expressing your emotions and acknowledging the hurt is an essential step in healing and personal growth. Start by building trust with someone you feel comfortable with, and take small steps in sharing your emotions.

Wanting understanding from others is completely normal, and it is possible to find people who can relate to your experiences.
It sounds like you've experienced a disconnect with your family when trying to share your feelings, and that's led you to question how much to share with them or others. It's important to have a support network where you can share your thoughts and feelings openly without judgment. If you don't feel that your family can provide that, seeking support from friends or other social groups may be beneficial. You mentioned moving away from the other two, could you please elaborate on who they are and how it's affecting you?
It sounds like the relationships in your life have been quite emotionally taxing and you've experienced a lack of genuine support and understanding from those around you. You worry about opening up because you've been hurt in the past.

It may feel strange or unreal now, but it's essential to focus on the present and make the most of our last session together.
It's natural to experience mixed emotions during important events and goodbyes. The sadness is a sign of how much that person meant to you, while the happiness reflects your personal growth and self-discovery.

As a counsellor, I understand your concern about endings. Perhaps we can approach this topic without forcing an ending in our sessions. It's important to focus on completing your personal growth and addressing your emotions regarding endings. By doing so, the natural progression of our work together might provide you with a sense of completion and excitement for the future, instead of feeling like it was abruptly taken away from you.
It's great to hear that you had a positive experience during our session, even though it brought out some emotions. It seems that feelings of incompletion and lack of control are impacting your perspective on endings. In our future sessions, we can further explore this recurring pattern in your life and work on strategies to help you feel more comfortable with completions and gain a sense of fulfillment when ending things.
Slow down, let's not jump to a sudden conclusion. Ending counseling is an important part of the work and an acknowledgement of your achievements. If we decide to end the counseling, it's something we can work towards together, rather than just not coming in next week. It's essential to have a proper closure to the therapy.
I understand that you might feel dismissed, but I want you to know that ending is a crucial part of counseling. My role is to honor our relationship and the work you've done. I believe in giving proper closure after every session, and I see myself aiming to do my job in the best way possible. If you could provide more details on how you would like our sessions to conclude, I will ensure that we address this concern.
I've noticed that finding a focus for our sessions has been a common issue lately.

It sounds like you've made great progress throughout your therapy, and it's natural to want to build a connection with your therapist.

It's totally normal to feel lost and confused at times. Maybe you can try reflecting on your interests and values to help identify what truly matters to you.

We don't have to make any decisions right now, so take your time to figure out what you truly want.
It sounds like you have experienced some disruptions in your life that left you feeling unprepared and powerless. It's important to recognize that those experiences can be tough to handle, but remember that I'm here to support you, not to send you away. We can work together on developing coping strategies for dealing with such situations in the future.
It sounds like your perspective on our relationship has shifted and you see me more as an equal now rather than just a safe place for your troubles. Would you like to discuss how this change may affect our counseling sessions moving forward and how we can best support your personal growth?
It's great that our sessions have been so helpful to you and that you've been able to open up about things you haven't shared with others. The counseling relationship is unique and can feel like a friendship, but it's important to remember that it's still a professional relationship with boundaries. The progress and self-reliance you've gained in therapy is excellent, and it's natural to feel a sense of partnership and rapport in your sessions. It's important to keep focusing on the issues you came with and continue working towards your goals.
I understand how important friendships can be at any age, and it must have been difficult for you to lose that connection with Sarah.

If you could go back, what would you want them to know about the significance of your friendship, and how could that understanding have positively impacted your life growing up?

I understand your frustration, and I apologize if bringing up your siblings felt irrelevant. As a counsellor, my goal is to gain a holistic understanding of your situation, which sometimes includes family dynamics. However, let's focus on your preferences for work over school and how this relates to your relationship with your parents. We can explore the underlying reasons behind their expectations and how you can communicate your desires effectively.
I understand that you might feel uncomfortable discussing your family and personal issues. As a counselor, sometimes we explore different aspects of your life to identify potential barriers or factors impacting your job search.

Please let me know about your experiences and challenges in finding a job so I can provide the most relevant guidance.
It sounds like you're facing a difficult situation with your parents. You mentioned that they really value education, and you don't want to go to school for now.

It seems like you're trying to figure out your path in life, and you're facing some resistance from your parents.

It sounds like you were influenced by your guru's teachings about perceiving reality through a higher level of consciousness, but you haven't attained that level. This idea of a universal consciousness is quite fascinating. Can you tell me more about your experience when you felt like your mind was being read, and how that has impacted you emotionally?
As a counsellor, I believe that the universal mind has potential, but it is only capable of doing what we as individuals do. Our actions and choices shape its influence. In a sense, we are the hands that allow it to act on this planet. Is there anything specific you'd like to know about its role in our lives?

It's not uncommon for people to feel observed or watched at times, but it's important to remember that doctors, like everyone else, have their own lives and work to focus on. Could you think of any specific event or encounter that might have triggered these thoughts or feelings in you?

Instead of dwelling on the conspiracy, try to shift your focus to your life and the things you can manage. If you still find it hard to cope with your feelings, please feel free to share more details about your concerns.
I think you might be on the right track. Jesus may have been encouraging people to be independent from their parents rather than resenting them. Being happily indifferent could suggest that you should focus on your own personal growth without getting overly concerned with your parents' opinions. Keep exploring your understanding of the passage and see how it applies to your life.
It's alright to feel like you haven't gained much wisdom as you age; growth is a lifelong process. It seems your father has played a significant role in your upbringing. Can you share any specific teachings or values from your father that have influenced you?

Also, try to connect with others who have gone through a similar adjustment, as they might have valuable advice and support to offer. Finally, be kind to yourself and remember that it takes time to get used to new habits and routines.
It's great that you're being observant and learning from different sources, like advertisements and TV, to understand societal norms and behaviors.

I understand your concerns, but it's essential to consider the long-term effects of your drinking on you and your family. Your husband's threat to leave might be a wake-up call, and the wellbeing of your children should not be overlooked. I can help you with strategies to reduce your alcohol consumption. Think about what you stand to lose if you don't make a change. How do you think your drinking is impacting your relationship with your children?

If you're concerned about this, perhaps you can speak to the building management or your company's leadership about implementing gender-neutral bathrooms, or look for other solutions to accommodate all employees comfortably.

Do you have any specific situations where you felt this concern was particularly prominent?
It's normal for people to feel defensive in therapy, especially when they're starting off with a new therapist.

Also, remember that with practice and time, your ability to open up and be direct will likely improve. Hang in there!
It's great that you recognize the need to evaluate your thoughts and replace them with more realistic ones. First, identify the specific thoughts that are causing your anxiety. Then, look for any cognitive distortions, such as exaggerating the negative aspects or underestimating your ability to cope.

Writing this process down in columns might further help you in organizing your thoughts and reducing your anxiety.

It seems like you were experiencing intense guilt about not being there to help someone who needed you. You might want to explore the reasons behind your guilt and think about whether it is justified or not. It's important to remember that we can't always be there for everyone. Can you provide more context about the situation and what led to the guilt?
It seems you are concerned about your friend's well-being and your role in being a support for him. You mentioned feeling like you're his only friend, which could lead to a sense of responsibility for his happiness. How do you think his reliance on you might affect your relationship with him in the long run?
It's great that you care about your friend, and it shows how much you value your friendship. However, it's important to understand that each person has their own coping mechanisms and support systems. Be there for your friend, offer help where you can, but also realize that ultimately, their healing process is their responsibility. Is there a specific incident or situation that has you concerned?
It's not uncommon to feel guilty in situations like this, but it's important to remember that you need to prioritize your own needs as well. It sounds like you tried to assert yourself by telling your friend you were busy. Instead of focusing on the guilt, think about how you can communicate with your friend in the future and offer support when you have time. Did you get a chance to follow-up with your friend later on?
It's great that you took the initiative to express your needs and ask for what you want. It's normal to feel guilt, but it's important to recognize the feeling and the thought behind it. In this case, the thought was 'I should be there when he needs me.' Remember that it's not always possible to be available for others all the time and it's perfectly okay to prioritize yourself when needed.

It's important to remember that he has managed without you in the past and hasn't stayed miserable. To break this habit, you can practice reminding yourself of this new thought when he's not on the phone. This might help you feel better and be more reasonable in your thinking. Is there a specific situation or conversation that triggered these thoughts recently?
It sounds like you're experiencing a physical response, such as a heaviness in your chest, due to the sense of responsibility you feel. Let's try to explore different ways to reframe your thinking so that you can take care of your own needs while still supporting your loved one. It's important to find a balance between being there for them and taking care of yourself.
It's normal to feel guilt in situations where we think our actions, or lack thereof, have affected someone else. However, it's important to remember that everyone has limitations and it's impossible to be available all the time. Focus on the fact that, in the past, when you haven't been available, the person has managed okay and found resources on their own. Also, consider discussing your guilt with the person involved, which might help you both gain better understanding and find ways to manage such situations in the future.
It is understandable that you care for your friend and feel responsible for their well-being, but remember that it's not solely your responsibility to help them. Have you suggested that they reach out to any professional resources or support groups that might be able to assist them in a more effective way?
It's great that you want to help your friend, but it's also important to examine the thought distortion behind this belief. Let's look at the evidence: Are there any other sources of support for your friend? Remember that it's not solely your responsibility to help others, and sometimes, people can find their own solutions as well.
It's great to hear that your friend was able to find some resources to cope with his bad mood on his own. However, it's essential to still offer your support and be there for him when needed. As his friend, you can encourage him to seek professional help or join a support group if his mental health struggles become overwhelming or unmanageable. Remember to take care of yourself as well, and maintain a balance between being supportive and setting boundaries for your well-being.

This way, you can attempt to clear the air and maintain your friendship while still acknowledging your own feelings and needs.
It's understandable that you feel some anxiety about discussing a topic with someone who's not present. This kind of anxiety, if you're willing to stay with it and go through it, might help you learn something and grow. Let's try an experiment where we set up a hypothetical scenario, allowing you to practice discussing the subject in a safe space.
It's great that you were able to express your desire to be there for him. To minimize misunderstandings, it's important to communicate with clarity and openness. If you've already mentioned your intentions and set the context, it can help create a foundation for open communication. Keep the conversation going and seek to understand each other's perspectives better.
It's great to hear that you find the idea of controlling your thoughts encouraging. Remember, it's normal to get stuck at times while practicing this technique. If you face any difficulty or need further guidance, we can definitely address it in our next session.
It's good to hear that you'll be able to express your thoughts and feelings more freely, and anticipate being more direct to clear up misunderstandings. I'll be looking forward to hearing how it goes next week.
As the counsellor, I understand that you don't have a particular topic in mind at the moment, which is completely fine. We can use this time to get to know each other better and explore any areas you might want to discuss or focus on in the future. Feel free to share anything about your life, experiences, or general thoughts, and I'm here to listen and support you.
It's great to hear that you're feeling freer and that it's helping you to be a better friend. It seems like there's still some lingering guilt, but it's reduced considerably. Remember, it's important to take care of yourself and know that it's okay not to be there all the time for your friend. He can support himself, and you can be there for him when you're able. Focus on maintaining a healthy balance.
It's understandable that you still feel a bit concerned, but it's important to recognize that there has been a positive shift in your friend's situation. Reflecting on which thought is more accurate - the idea that he's miserable and needy without you or that he is now able to find support independently - might help you ease this lingering concern. Remember, it's normal to worry about the people we care about, but it's also crucial to acknowledge their growth and ability to adapt.
It's important to recognize that crooked thinking can lead to unnecessary distress, and examining these thoughts can help you find more sensible alternatives. It's great that you want to discuss the situation with someone. I would recommend taking a step back, examining your thoughts, and finding the courage to have an open and honest conversation with that person. This might help in understanding the situation better and bringing clarity to your thoughts.
That's great to hear! It's important to explore the different dimensions of your current situations and find various ways to cope and manage them. As we continue in future sessions, we can work together to address these issues and set clear goals for your progress.
It is possible that by engaging in a conversation with him, you may find a different dimension to the situation, similarly to how we've discovered this new perspective today. I understand that you have been proactive in addressing your own fears, and it's important to recognize and validate his feelings as well. Would you be open to having this conversation with him?
It's great to hear that you now have a better understanding of the support available to you. Remember, it's always important to utilize these resources when you're feeling overwhelmed. Are there any specific areas or concerns you'd like to explore further?
It seems like you have a complex family dynamic, but it's important to recognize the support system available to you. Your father's side of the family is willing to help and is concerned.

This way, you won't feel burdened and your brother can focus on his college years. Remember, you don't have to face this alone.
It's great that you have completed the genogram, as this will help us in addressing your feelings of loneliness and being overwhelmed. Let's look at the genogram together and explore the resources and support available within your family. This may help you feel less lonely and provide a better understanding of how to manage the challenges following your father's diagnosis. Please share your genogram with me so we can discuss it further.
I appreciate you sharing your genogram with me as it offers insight into your family background. It seems you've put thought into representing your family's history and connections. Regarding your feelings of loneliness, it's possible that the recent passing of your great grandparents may have intensified these emotions. Is there any particular incident or aspect from your genogram that you'd like to discuss further?
I understand that your father's side of the family is not very close, while your mother's side, despite having a larger number of members, seems to have a deeper connection. It's common for families to have varying levels of closeness, and it's natural to feel different attachments to each side. How does the relationship with your extended family affect you emotionally?
It's great that you recognize the need for support and are willing to take action. Let's adjourn for now, but we'll revisit these potential actions during our next session to see if you've been able to implement them and discuss the outcomes. If you need help with building those relationships, I'll be here to guide you through the process.
It seems you're struggling with a lack of support and understanding from both sides of your family. It's difficult to handle everything on your own, but it's important to find ways to cope and express your feelings. Consider finding a support network outside of your family, such as friends or a support group, and continue to communicate your emotions to your close ones while trying to maintain a balance between responsibility and self-care.
It's great to hear that you have a supportive family unit that you can lean on during tough times. Remember that sharing your diagnosis with them might not only provide you with additional support, but also bring you closer together. If you're feeling lonely or overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out to your family, particularly your relatives from Trinidad, as their help could be a valuable resource. Have you considered talking to your mom about accepting help from your aunt when she offers it?
It sounds like your family is going through a difficult time because of your father's cancer diagnosis. It's normal to feel worried about your own health and the impact this has on your family's plans. It's also important to acknowledge and validate your feelings of resentment, as it can be emotionally challenging to take on caregiving responsibilities. Have you talked to your brother about your concerns and thoughts on sharing the responsibilities equally? Opening up a conversation may help in finding a better balance and support for each other.
It's great that you're embracing your cultural background and using it as a source of strength in taking care of your father. Every family is different and it's possible that your siblings might not share that same perspective. In order to help you navigate these family dynamics, it may be useful to have open conversations with your siblings and see if there is any way they could support you. Remember that taking care of yourself is equally important, so ensure that you are seeking any support you may need.
It's great to hear that you've found mindfulness helpful in allowing yourself to take a break. It's important to find balance between work and relaxation. It's possible that you have been an overachiever, but taking breaks and practicing mindfulness can actually make you more productive in the long run. So, incorporating these exercises into your daily routine can be beneficial.
I'm glad to hear that mindfulness is helping you feel less anxious! It can be a bit difficult to learn and incorporate into your life, but you've done a great job so far. We can continue working on different exercises and ways to incorporate mindfulness into your daily life, as there are so many different methods to bring more peace and balance into your life.
As a counsellor, I would suggest you to take some time and reflect on your thoughts and feelings to identify any potential triggers for your unease and discontent. It might be helpful to keep a journal to track your emotions and see if there's a pattern. Also, consider talking to friends or family members to gain a different perspective on your feelings. If your unease and discontent persist, it might be a good idea to seek professional help.
It's understandable to have anxiety about job interviews, especially when they're important to your career. To help alleviate your anxiety, try practicing your responses to potential interview questions. Additionally, set realistic expectations and remind yourself of your strengths and past successes. During interviews, take deep breaths to help manage your anxiety. Is there a specific aspect of the interviews that you find most stressful?
It's completely normal to experience anxiety during job interviews. Our minds often tend to focus on negativity, but it's important to remember that the brain can be rewired to activate positive emotions and confidence. As a counsellor, I suggest trying a mindfulness exercise where you recall a time in your life when you felt confident and capable, like your experience in Singapore. This can help you activate those neural networks and boost your confidence again.
It's great that you can recall a time when you felt confident. Let's try a visualization exercise. I want you to close your eyes and bring that moment to your mind. Really focus on the sensation of confidence you had during that time. Now take a deep breath and try to embody that feeling again. Once you've truly grasped it, start incorporating that feeling into different aspects of your life to help boost your confidence.
It's important to find a balance between work and leisure time. If you feel that spending too much time in front of the TV is not productive, you might consider exploring alternative ways to relax and unwind after work. You could try engaging in physical activities, reading, or picking up a new hobby. Remember, it's essential to give yourself time to recharge mentally and maintain a healthy routine.
I understand that it's challenging to deal with so much information and stimulation, which could lead to increased anxiety. Have you considered practicing mindfulness? It can help you in finding some mental space and rest by focusing on the present moment and acknowledging your feelings without judgment. This might help in reducing your anxiety and providing your brain with some much-needed rest.
As a counsellor, I agree that taking a break from technology and practicing mindfulness can be very helpful for your mental health, especially in dealing with anxiety and depression. Mindfulness is about being fully present in the moment and learning to relate to our thoughts and emotions in a different way. Let's try a mindfulness exercise together during our session. First, please make sure your feet are flat on the ground for grounding. Remember that mindfulness is not about stopping your thoughts, but rather observing them without judgment.
It's important to be aware of these sensations and how they change. Since it's still persisting, can you describe any specific factors or situations that seem to trigger or worsen these sensations? This information will help in understanding your concerns better and provide appropriate guidance.
I'm glad to hear that you find it nice to take a moment to just look at the ground and breathe. It's important to take time for ourselves and engage in activities that help us relax and be present. Consider incorporating mindfulness or meditation exercises in your daily routine to continue experiencing those benefits.
It's important to acknowledge your anxiety instead of avoiding it. When we avoid anxiety, it can actually increase. By being aware of it and allowing it to be present, you can understand that this feeling isn't permanent. Emotions often rise, peak, and then decrease, so try to sit with the anxiety, observe it, and know that you can work through it.
It's important to understand that anxiety is not your entire being, it's just a part of you. Anxiety can move and shift when we stop ignoring and resisting it. Acknowledge and face your anxiety, and you might find that it becomes easier to manage and navigate through it.
It seems like you're struggling with daily anxiety that is triggered by your alarm clock and the thought of tasks ahead. Using social media as a coping mechanism might provide temporary relief, but it's not addressing the root cause of your anxiety. To better manage your anxiety, try incorporating relaxation techniques like deep breathing and mindfulness practices into your daily routine, and consider setting smaller, more achievable goals for each day. Also, think about reducing your social media use to minimize distractions and focus on addressing your anxiety.
It's understandable that anxiety can be uncomfortable due to your racing heart and restlessness. When you try to avoid anxiety, do you notice any specific activities or situations that trigger these feelings? Recognizing and addressing these triggers can help in reducing anxiety levels and make you feel more at ease.
I understand that discussing anxiety can make it feel more intense. Would you be willing to experience the anxiety just a little bit, while we are in this safe space together? Don't worry, I won't let it become overwhelming for you.
It's common for anxiety to manifest in different parts of the body. Since you mentioned feeling anxiety in your heart, stomach, and right arm, let's focus on grounding exercises to help you relax. Start by putting your feet flat on the ground and taking a few deep breaths. Is there anything specific that's causing you to feel anxious?
It's natural to feel protective of your personal space, and it's important to set boundaries with those around you. But it's also important to communicate your concerns in a respectful manner. So, instead of raising your voice or cursing, try having a calm conversation with the person to express your feelings and establish a mutual understanding. But, I'm curious, how does this person react when you raise your voice or curse?
It can be challenging to deal with a sibling who continuously upsets you. Acting like Carrie might be a way to change the dynamic and see if it influences your brother's behavior. However, you can also try calmly and assertively communicating with Jeff about how his actions make you feel and discuss boundaries. You mentioned that there might be more drastic situations where you don't think he'd change; could you provide an example to better understand the dynamics between you?
Do you think if you were calm and collected and focused and you kept doing that for a while he'd, what would he say, 'Mom, something wrong with Melissa, she's not feeling well. She's too calm. She's not yelling. She's not cursing.' Do you think they'd think there's something wrong with you? It might be interesting data for you to act differently and evaluate the result of your different action, to see how people react, your family, in particular. It's an experiment. My hunch is they wouldn't get upset. Because they're used to seeing you in a certain way and the way they use to see you is the way that, that part of you you don't like. Ah, am I hearing you right?
It seems that your anger stems from feeling disrespected and unappreciated, particularly when people don't reciprocate the actions you would do for them. It's important to recognize what triggers your anger and to communicate your feelings and expectations with others in a healthy and constructive way. Can you give me another example of a situation that makes you angry?
It's normal to experience frustration or anger when encountering a bad driver. It's essential to find healthy ways to manage these emotions and maintain a proper perspective on the situation. Try to focus on your driving and remind yourself that getting angry won't change the other driver's behavior. Would you like to discuss any other scenarios that provoke anger in you, so we can further explore strategies for managing those emotions?
It sounds like your anger may be driven by the way you interpret and process situations. While it can be frustrating when people are careless, it's important to remember that we all have different tolerances for different behaviors. One way to manage your anger could be by consciously reframing how you perceive these events and practicing mindfulness to help regulate your emotional response. Are there any specific situations that provoke your anger more intensely?
It's great that you're considering making changes for your overall wellbeing. Since you mentioned that you enjoy science, would you be interested in trying a scientific experiment to explore ways of becoming healthier and improving your relationships?
As a counsellor, I would say that it's natural to feel concerned about how others perceive us, especially those we live with. I have a hypothesis that they might have some trouble adjusting to your changes at first. However, I would like to ask you, have you talked with them about your feelings and the changes you want to make in your life?
It's important to consider alternative ways to handle such situations. Let's try an experiment - imagine coming home tonight and finding your brother's laundry in your room. Instead of yelling, try a different approach, such as calmly discussing the issue with him. This may lead to more positive outcomes and a better relationship with your brother.
I understand that you were frustrated in that situation. Since the person was surprised by your reaction, it's essential to communicate your feelings openly to help them understand the reason behind your outburst. So, next time you feel angry, try to express your thoughts calmly before taking any actions.
It seems like your anxiety and anger are triggered by situations where you feel disrespected or invaded, like in traffic or at home with your family. One technique to help manage these emotions is to practice deep breathing and grounding yourself in the moment. Also, consider keeping a journal to track when these incidents occur and reflect on any patterns or thoughts that might be contributing to your reactions. You mentioned that you're aware that you shouldn't be reacting this way, that's a positive realization and a starting point to work on developing healthier coping mechanisms.
It sounds like your anxiety and anger issues are deeply rooted in your family situation, particularly with your father during your teenage years. I would suggest exploring those emotions and experiences further, as understanding and addressing the cause can help in managing your anger and anxiety. Did you ever have a chance to discuss and resolve your feelings with your father?
Thank you for sharing your feelings. As your counsellor, it's important for me to ensure that I provide a safe environment for our discussions and do not inadvertently cause any harm or discomfort. I appreciate your feedback, and I'm glad you felt comfortable during our session. Remember, you can always bring up any concerns or discomfort in future meetings if needed.
As the counsellor, I can see that you've made progress and it's essential to recognize it. I appreciate your commitment and willingness to work with me in this process. We will continue to address your concerns and keep working together to further your growth and improvement. If there's anything you would like to focus on more in our next session, feel free to mention it.
Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It's great that you want to manage your anxiety and stress. One technique you can try is deep breathing exercises to help you stay calm and relaxed. Additionally, I suggest taking a moment to identify the triggers of your anxiety and try to address them. If you need more in-depth support, consider seeking a therapist or professional help. It's also nice to hear that you see this meeting as a valuable experience, and I am here to help you through this.
It's great that you recognize the impact of anxiety on your behavior and are seeking help to manage it. One effective approach is to practice mindfulness and deep breathing exercises during moments of high stress. This can help you become more grounded and better able to communicate your needs without losing your temper. Additionally, identifying and challenging negative thought patterns can also help in alleviating anxiety and improving communication. Remember, it takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself as you work on these techniques.
It's important to be aware of how anxiety can impact your behavior and to learn strategies to manage it effectively. First, try to identify the triggers for your anxiety and temper, and then consider practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, to help calm yourself down. Also, think about the consequences of losing your temper before reacting, which can help you respond in a more measured way. Does a particular situation or thought pattern cause your anxiety and temper flare-ups?
As a counsellor, it's great that you're trying new ways of behaving to see the results. If your family doesn't notice your changes, it doesn't necessarily mean your efforts are futile. It could just mean that they haven't had the chance to realize the changes yet. Give them some time, and don't feel discouraged. Remember, the main goal is for you to feel comfortable with your new behavior; the approval of others is secondary. If you're still concerned about their reactions, have you considered discussing these changes with them?
Yes, I can definitely help you with that. First, let's identify the situations that trigger your anger. Second, we need to find effective ways to cope with these triggers, by practicing relaxation techniques or learning alternative ways of responding. Third, try to identify the thought process that leads to your anger and work on changing your perspectives. These three tasks sound reasonable to work on during the ongoing counseling sessions. How do you feel about trying these suggestions?
I'm glad to hear that you're feeling good and excited about the goal. As you continue to work on this experiment, remember to approach it scientifically. Think about how you might tackle it, collect data, and record your observations. Then, bring those notes to your counseling sessions so we can discuss your progress together. Keep up the good work and feel free to share any other thoughts or concerns during our sessions.
That's great to hear! I'm going to give you this resource to take home with you for further assistance. Just remember to bring it back next time, and good luck with your ongoing efforts to improve your attitude, Melissa.
Thank you for sharing your feelings. It's important to recognize the need for change in the way you handle your anger. Let's try an exercise. Picture in your mind someone who handles their anger well and imagine how they would handle a situation that triggers your anger. This visualization can help you understand the kind of person you want to become and guide you towards better ways of expressing your anger.
It seems like you want to improve your communication skills and learn how to handle situations like this more effectively. Since your family has similar behaviors, it might be helpful to explore solutions outside of your family's influence. You could try reading self-help books or attending workshops on assertiveness and communication to learn new strategies. Also, you could consider observing how others handle similar situations and try to implement those techniques. Is there a specific concern about your communication that you'd like to address?
It seems that you feel your personal space has been invaded by your father's actions, which has led to feelings of anger and frustration. This feeling of intrusion can be triggered by various other events, such as someone leaving laundry in your room or cutting you off in traffic. It's important to recognize these triggers and work towards developing healthier coping strategies to manage your emotions and communicate your needs more effectively. Can you identify a recent situation where you could have handled your emotions differently?
It's important to recognize that certain situations trigger your anger and that you have the ability to control it at work. However, it's not healthy to suppress anger completely, as it may manifest in other ways. Instead, try to identify the root cause of your anger and work on healthy coping mechanisms, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation. Is there any particular reason why you feel comfortable letting out your anger towards your father, brothers, or strangers on the road?
It's natural to have different reactions with people based on our relationships with them. Since your brother is close to you, it might be easier for you to be assertive with him. However, it's important to maintain respectful communication with your brother and others as well. Are there any specific situations that you've found challenging to handle?
It's good that you're recognizing the impact of your temper and aggressiveness on various aspects of your life. Since you mentioned that it might affect your relationships at work, it's essential to find ways to manage and control your emotions. Have you considered any anger management techniques or seeking professional help to address this issue?
It's great to hear that you recognize the importance of making changes in your relationships and that you feel ready to take action. Since this is a good time for you, we can explore the reasons behind this and work together on strategies to improve your relationships. Do you have any specific goals in mind for these changes?
It's great that you're taking steps to improve yourself. Based on what you've shared, I suggest we work on your communication skills and managing your temper. We can focus on increasing your assertiveness while decreasing aggressive behavior. This way, you'll be able to foster healthy relationships with various people and create a more positive future for yourself.
It's great that you recognize this pattern in your behavior and have the desire to change. I suggest you try an experiment: practice being more mindful of your thoughts and actions before you speak. This can help you avoid impulsiveness and lead to better outcomes. Can you think of a specific situation in which you can start practicing this new approach?
It's great to hear that you're willing to work on this longstanding issue. It might be a hard job, but it's not impossible. Remember, changing something that's a part of you is a significant task, so be patient with yourself and trust in the process.

Remember, it's important to express your emotions, but the way you do it can have a significant impact on your relationships and self-esteem.
It's great to hear that you're motivated to accomplish your goal. This motivation can be a driving force for personal growth and success. Is there any specific area where you're facing challenges or need guidance to move forward?
That's a great goal, and it's important to be aware of our communication styles to improve our relationships with others. Keep in mind that people may be surprised by the change in your tone and may ask if you're feeling okay. Embrace this as an opportunity to show them the benefits of a calmer approach.
It seems like you tend to process information in a way that sometimes leads to anger. To better understand and manage your emotions, it would be helpful to identify the specific thoughts that are going through your head in situations when you get angry. Once you're aware of these thoughts, we can work on developing healthier ways to respond to them.
It sounds like you're experiencing feelings of being undervalued or not genuinely wanted at social events. It's natural to feel upset in these situations, however, it's important to remember that your worth isn't solely based on what others think. Can you recall any moments during these events where you feel you received genuine appreciation or made a meaningful connection with others?
It's important to maintain a healthy communication with those who are part of your life. As a counsellor, I encourage you to share your thoughts and feelings with them while also actively listening to their opinions. Can you provide more information about any specific issue or concern that you might be facing in this living situation?
It's great that you're open to trying new ways to communicate with your brother. For the next couple of days, try to calmly and assertively express your feelings to him, like saying 'Jeff, I don't appreciate when you leave your stuff in my room' or 'Jeff, I don't appreciate you taking things that belong to me. Please stay out of my room, thank you.' What do you predict will happen after trying this approach?
It's good that you've recognized the possible cause of your brother's defiance. Changing your approach can indeed help in improving your relationship with him. This will be like an experiment – to see how he responds when you stop yelling. The results of this experiment can be valuable information for you in understanding how to effectively communicate with not only your brother but also others in similar situations.
It's normal to experience an initial increase in provocation when you're trying to change your behavior. People might still expect you to react angrily and may try to push your buttons. However, if you continue to stay calm and act differently, they'll eventually realize that it's not fun anymore and stop provoking you. Stay persistent, and you'll likely see a de-escalation in their behavior over time.
It's okay to be unsure about what you want to be; this can be a process of self-discovery. To help you figure it out, consider what values and qualities you want to embody rather than specific roles or people. What are your passions and interests? Reflect on what brings out the best in you and start from there.
It's great that you have recognized the traits you admire in others and want to incorporate them into your own life. To be a better communicator and handle stress like your friends, you can start by practicing active listening, expressing yourself calmly, and learning ways to manage your emotions. Is there a specific situation or aspect of your life where you feel the need to improve your communication and stress handling skills?
You have identified a good ideal in 'Carrie' who handles conflicts calmly and effectively. It is important to maintain a calm and assertive tone when addressing issues with your family members. However, if they don't respond positively to your efforts, it could be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings and desires for a more harmonious living situation. You could also consider seeking support from a neutral and trustworthy person to mediate the communication between you and your family members.
It's interesting that you've noticed the connection between your family's communication style and your own anger. Family styles definitely influence the way we interact with others and handle emotions. Think about whether your family encouraged open expression, or if there was a tendency to suppress feelings which could lead to internalized anger. Reflect on how these patterns from your family might be contributing to your current emotional state, and consider if adopting a more balanced approach to expressing your feelings and managing your anger could be beneficial to you.
It's important to recognize that you can only control your own actions and reactions in this situation. While it would be ideal for everyone in the household to acknowledge and work on their communication issues together, that may not be possible. Focus on improving your communication skills and managing your reactions to the impulsive behaviors around you. Perhaps, over time, your efforts towards positive change might in turn influence those around you.
It sounds like 'nice' has a deeper meaning for you, encompassing memories and the connections with your father and children. It's great that discussing these things helps you gain a sense of continuity and growth through time. It's okay for us to explore these thoughts further, and if at any point it feels uncomfortable, please let me know. The manner in which we approach these topics should be with curiosity and respect, rather than being intrusive.
As a counsellor, I appreciate you opening up about the connections between breakfast and important values in your life.

It's understandable to feel stressed and anxious about uncertainties. To focus on what you can control, try making a list of tasks or goals that you can work on, and remind yourself that it's normal to feel this way sometimes. Is there a specific event or situation that triggered these feelings?
It's great to hear that breakfast has always been a positive and enjoyable experience for you, providing needed energy for the day. Not everyone shares the same perspective on breakfast, so it's quite special that you have such fond memories associated with it, especially with your dad. If you don't mind me asking, do you still maintain this breakfast tradition?
It's really nice to hear about those fond memories with your dad. It seems like that breakfast holds a special place in your heart, not just for the taste but also for the moments spent with him.

It's great to see that you're reflecting on how your actions and values connect to your role as a parent, and your desire to make a positive impact on society.

I recall when you first came for treatment, you were weighing yourself several times a day, which contributed to your unhappiness about your weight. We decided to experiment by weighing you only once a week, and although it was difficult at first, you eventually felt relieved not thinking about your weight all the time. How is your current relationship with tracking your weight?
You're right that many people have concerns about their appearance to some extent, but it seems that you are engaging in this behavior more frequently and intensely, which might be negatively affecting your well-being. We should work on gaining control over this behavior, and evaluating each action separately. Some of them might be worth eliminating, like measuring your thighs with a tape measure, while others can be reduced to a healthier level. Doing this will help lessen your concerns and improve your overall outlook on your body.
I'm glad that you found our conversation helpful. It's important to recognize that some behaviors might be common, but can become problematic if taken to the extreme. In terms of using mirrors, it's worth reflecting on how you utilize them and whether they contribute to negative self-perceptions. If you find that they do, consider reducing your reliance on them or altering how you engage with them. Remember, it's always important to strike a healthy balance.
It's great that you want to discuss Sunday, as it's important for us to understand setbacks to ensure your long-term well-being. Having a setback can actually help us learn more about how your eating problem works and how to maintain your progress in the future. It's common to experience ups and downs in recovery, and we can use this experience to strengthen your coping strategies. Can you provide more details about what specifically happened on Sunday that concerns you?
It's quite common for people to scrutinize their bodies, so you're not alone in this behavior. However, constantly looking for perceived flaws can lead to dissatisfaction with your body image. Instead of focusing on scrutinizing yourself, try to shift your focus towards self-acceptance and healthy habits. Have you considered limiting the time spent in front of the mirror or finding alternative methods of gauging your progress?
It's important to remember that everyone has unique experiences and ways of coping, and what might be normal for one person might be unusual for another. Can you provide me with more specific examples of the actions you are referring to, so I can better understand your situation and offer more personalized guidance?
It seems that you are quite preoccupied with your body shape and it's causing you distress. Constantly checking your body and focusing on parts you're unhappy with may actually be contributing to your unhappiness. Perhaps it would be helpful for you to shift your focus to more constructive ways of maintaining and improving your overall health and well-being. What do you think?
It's not uncommon for behavior patterns to become automatic over time, but change is possible. Begin by becoming more mindful of your actions and try to identify any triggers that may cause these automatic behaviors. Once you recognize them, you can start making conscious efforts to change. Remember, breaking old habits and forming new ones takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself.
Thank you for sharing your concerns. It is possible that your attempts to control your eating might be related to the feeling of losing control in other areas of your life. However, it is important to acknowledge that keeping your weight very low and eating very little can have significant impacts on your mood, concentration, and overall well-being. Many people in your situation have experienced improvements in their lives once they regain a healthy weight. It's essential to explore these aspects to determine if they are inherently your personality or if they are influenced by your low weight and restricted eating.
It's great to hear that you're finding relief in practicing control over your emotions. It's natural to still feel worried about emotions happening at unexpected moments. Be patient with yourself and continue practicing. With time, you'll build more confidence in your ability to manage and understand your emotions. Remember, it's a learning process, and it's okay to have setbacks.
It's great that you've started to recognize the connection between your behaviors on Saturday and the problems you experienced on Sunday. It's important to reflect on how our actions can affect our mental state. As a next step, try to identify any other patterns or triggers so we can better understand and address the issue. Can you think of any other instances where your behavior on one day led to negative consequences or feelings on a later day?
I appreciate your honesty about your initial confusion and eventual understanding of the analogy. It's important to take things one step at a time, and as we continue our sessions, I believe you'll gain more confidence in your ability to influence this mindset. Remember, progress can sometimes be slow, but together we'll work to help you better manage your thoughts and emotions.
It sounds like you are going through a difficult time with anxiety and eating habits. Eating is a social activity, and it's understandable your relationship may be affected by wanting to eat alone. Can you explain why you prefer to eat alone? Once we understand the root cause, we can work together to create a plan for improving your overall wellbeing and addressing the impact on your work and relationships.
It's great that you want to be more aware of your triggers. Being able to spot them in advance can help you avoid falling into unhealthy patterns. When you notice these early signs, try to respond in the opposite way that your unhealthy habit would dictate. With practice, you'll find that your negative behaviors are less likely to be triggered, and you'll feel more in control of your actions.
As a counsellor, I understand that your dreadful Sunday might have been a difficult experience for you. My response was meant to help you see the situation from a different perspective, rather than fueling the worry. Sometimes, approaching challenging experiences as interesting can help us cope better and find solutions. Remember, I'm here to support you in overcoming your problems, even if my approach might seem unexpected at times.
It's great that you're recognizing the need to address the underlying issues behind your eating habits. It's common to feel apprehensive about discussing these topics, but remember that the counsellor is here to help and support you. Let's focus on identifying what in your life is contributing to these feelings and work towards developing a healthier mindset around food, weight, and control.
I noticed that you felt uncomfortable discussing these issues, and I apologize if it seemed like I was pushing you off. It's important for us to understand the reasons behind your eating habits and how they're affecting your health, so let's try to approach this topic in a more comfortable and supportive manner. What is a specific aspect of your eating habits that you'd be willing to discuss without feeling too vulnerable?
As a counsellor, I understand that discussing the connection between your eating habits and your sense of control in life may feel intrusive. It takes courage to explore these uncomfortable feelings, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing that. It's good that you are here, and I encourage you to continue exploring your thoughts and emotions with me.
It's understandable that the thought of gaining weight might make you feel uncertain. Our goal is not only to change the way you eat but also to address the underlying emotional and psychological aspects of your relationship with food and your body. It's essential to explore those feelings and help you develop healthier coping mechanisms.
It's interesting that your concern about eating and exercise has increased after spending more time at the gym and talking to a friend. Can you think of anything specific during that conversation or while at the gym that might have triggered this sudden change in your mindset? It's important to explore the underlying cause behind the change in your behavior.
It's great that you're reflecting on your eating habits and seeking advice. It's important to have a balanced approach to diet and exercise. If you're worried about overdoing it on weekends, consider examining your eating patterns and be conscious of portion sizes and food choices. Additionally, you can seek guidance from a nutritionist or health professional if you feel the need to make significant changes to your eating habits.
Thank you for sharing that experience. It seems like the exercise made you aware of some habits you didn't know you had concerning your body image. You mentioned a lot about noticing your stomach and the frequent mirror-checking; this could be an opportunity for us to explore these habits further to understand why they have become such a significant part of your daily routine and what emotions are behind them. Don't worry; it's quite common for people to have self-conscious thoughts about their appearance. Our task moving forward will be to address and navigate these habits to find healthier ways of dealing with self-image concerns.
Yes, it seems like the way you focus on specific parts of your body, instead of your body as a whole, may be contributing to your dissatisfaction with your shape. Constantly checking yourself and looking for problems can lead to a negative self-image and a critical mindset, even when you may not be consciously aware of it. This repeated process can be one of the reasons behind your day-to-day dissatisfaction with your shape.
Thank you for sharing that with me, it's important to be open about your feelings. It's normal to feel awkward discussing personal habits, but recognizing your behavior is an important step towards making changes. Did you notice any patterns or triggers that might lead to your frequent shape-checking?
As a counsellor, I understand your concern about having too many mirrors, and it might be affecting your self-perception. It's essential to find a healthy balance, as mirrors should be used for practical purposes and not to constantly scrutinize ourselves. You mentioned that you might be able to manage with two mirrors, try simplifying and reducing the number of mirrors you have and observe how it affects your thoughts and feelings about your body.
It's quite common for people with eating disorders or body image issues to use mirrors in peculiar ways like you mentioned. Focusing only on the dissatisfying parts can significantly distort your perception of your own body. A similar phenomenon can be seen in people with phobias, such as spider-phobics. Let's work on strategies to help you have a healthier relationship with mirrors and develop a more balanced view of your body. Would you like to discuss specific situations where you struggle with this behavior?
I understand that you're feeling tense about issues related to eating and weight. It's completely normal to feel this way, and I'm glad you're seeking help. Let's dive deeper into these issues together. We'll work on finding the root cause and come up with strategies to manage your tension and make positive improvements. Remember, there's always hope, and we're here to support you.
I understand that discussing the connections between eating, weight, and your emotional state can be challenging. It's important to acknowledge that these are interconnected aspects of your well-being. It's great that hearing about others' experiences and their positive changes has provided you with some hope. Remember, recovery is possible, and I'm here to support you through this process. Are there any aspects of their stories that particularly resonated with you and would like to explore further?
It sounds like you enjoyed your time with your friend and had a normal experience. It's natural to have some worries after socializing, but I'm glad to hear that you've been feeling fine since then. Remember, it's important to focus on the present and not dwell too much on past events. If you'd like to talk more about your worries, please feel free to share more details.
I understand that you had a difficult Sunday after a few weeks of progress. It's interesting to note that on Saturday, your eating habits were different with diet food and a skipped snack. Sometimes, changes in our routine can affect our emotions and lead to a rough day. Would you mind sharing what happened on Sunday that has you so worried?
It seems like you have had a day that reminds you of your earlier eating habits. It is essential to recognize these changes and work on finding a balance in your eating patterns. If you missed a mid-afternoon snack due to being busy, try to incorporate healthier snacking options into your daily routine, even when you are occupied.
I understand your concerns about the dynamics of your relationship with Oz. If you feel like Oz is set in his ways and you're tired of the status quo, it's important to communicate your feelings and needs with him. Have you tried having an open conversation with him on these issues, and expressed your desire for a more equal division of responsibilities within the home?
It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and unfulfilled in your marriage due to a lack of collaboration and support from your husband. It's important to express your feelings and expectations to him in order for both of you to work on improving your relationship. In the meantime, consider seeking support from friends, family or a therapist to discuss your feelings and concerns. Can you think of any strategies or specific actions that you both can take to improve your collaboration in the marriage?

It's important to keep the lines of communication open and work together in order to make progress in your relationship.
It sounds like you're noticing some significant changes in your partner's behavior, which can be concerning. It's possible that he's going through some personal growth or experiencing stress that is affecting his behavior. I recommend talking to your partner about these changes and expressing how you feel. Be open to listening to his perspective, and remember that communication is key in relationships. If the changes are causing distress, consider seeking professional help together, such as couples counseling.
As your counsellor, I would like to explain that the dysfunctional thought record is a helpful tool to identify and analyze your negative thoughts and emotions. Please start by noting down situations and events that trigger these thoughts. If you need further clarification, you can refer to the book or feel free to ask me any questions you may have about how to use the sheet effectively.
It seems like you're hoping for some modifications in your partner's behavior, but you're not sure if the changes he's making are genuine. Do you think your expectations might be a little too high? It's also important to consider other factors that might be affecting his attempts to change.
It sounds like you're questioning your partner's love for you based on the way he expresses his feelings. Have you tried talking to him about how you feel and asking him directly about his feelings for you? Communication is key in relationships, and it's important to voice your concerns to understand each other better.
It sounds like you're facing some challenges in your relationship with Oz, particularly in terms of parenting. It's important to have a united front when it comes to disciplining children. Would you mind sharing an example of a situation where you felt your husband undermined your authority?
It sounds like you're facing challenges in your relationship due to your partner's lack of involvement and feeling like he's undoing your efforts. It's crucial to open up a line of communication with your partner and express your concerns. Have you tried discussing this issue with him and finding a possible solution together?
Thank you for sharing that with me. I understand that it may feel overwhelming at times, but working on the first three columns of the thought record is a great start. It will help you become more aware of the thoughts and emotions associated with certain situations. Remember, we will gradually introduce more concepts, like cognitive distortions and alternative thoughts, throughout our sessions. For now, focus on these initial steps and we will discuss further in our next appointment.
It's normal to feel confused at times, especially in a conversation with multiple people. Sometimes, participants might not express their thoughts clearly, or the conversation might be moving too fast. Try to focus on the main points and ask for clarification if needed.
It's great that you're willing to try new ways to manage your worries. One technique you can use is 'worry time' where you set aside a specific time and place to worry. To do this, when you notice a worrisome thought, acknowledge it and make a note of it, postponing it until your designated worry time. Meanwhile, try to focus on your present task or use relaxation techniques to calm your mind. It may take some practice, but eventually, you'll be able to better manage your worries.
Thank you for sharing your worry. Let's turn that anticipation into a prediction and assess its likelihood: How likely is it, on a scale of 0 to 100%, that you won't be able to make the lunches and the kids will go to school without them? (0 means it's not going to happen, 100 means it's definitely going to happen, and 50 means a 50-50 chance.)
It's normal to feel uncertain about decisions from time to time, but it's important to explore why you're feeling this way. Are there specific decisions that you're doubting, or is it a general feeling? Try assessing your thought patterns and if necessary, seek guidance from supportive friends or professionals to help address your concerns.
It seems like your worries are anticipations of routine events in your day, and they occur in various situations and times, repeating themselves daily. This cycle can result in certain situations triggering your worries. One important thing to understand is that by worrying in multiple settings or situations repeatedly, just returning to that situation can trigger your worries again. They get associated with each other, and repeating them keeps that setting and worry association alive.
It's natural for worries to emerge in certain situations, but it's important to distinguish between your worry reaction and your response to that reaction. Since you've been focusing on preventing the worry from happening, try shifting your focus on acknowledging the worry and then finding a healthier way to cope with it. You can prioritize tasks, set realistic goals, or even practice relaxation techniques to help manage your worries.
As a counsellor, I suggest exploring alternative responses to your worries. Instead of getting caught up, try letting the worry go by acknowledging it and then focusing on a different, more positive thought. It’s essential to practice and develop this skill, as it can greatly help in managing overwhelming thoughts and reducing worry.
I'm glad you remember the details from our last session. To help you implement the chosen solution, we can practice the conversation together in a role play here in the office. This will allow you to feel more confident when you approach your boss and have the conversation in real life. Are you willing to try this role play with me to better prepare yourself for the actual conversation?
It's great that you are practicing the conversation with a role-play to reduce your anxiety. Remember that it's normal to feel nervous about discussing something important with your supervisor. Take a deep breath, be confident, and approach Chuck when the time feels right. You mentioned that the role-play went well after a few tries, so trust your ability to handle the conversation. If you feel the need for more specific guidance, feel free to let me know the details of the question that's bothering you.
It's understandable that you're worried about your kids being well-fed and able to focus in school. However, it's important to remember that you have a high probability of successfully making their lunches. If the worst-case scenario does happen and they are hungry one day, have you considered other options like giving them money to buy lunch or asking the school for assistance? This could help alleviate some of your stress and guilt in such situations.
It seems like your worry may be overestimating the actual likelihood of the problem occurring. As you mentioned, you've always managed to make the lunches for your kids, despite believing there's a 20% chance of not getting it done. Try examining the evidence in your life to see if it supports the prediction your worry is making or if it supports something other than the worry. For instance, have your kids ever gone to school without lunch?
Considering that this worry has occurred so many times and has never been right, it seems like it might be an irrational fear. If this worry was a real person who constantly told you that your fear would come true and it never did, you'd probably tell them to be quiet. It's important to recognize the pattern and challenge the validity of the worry, as it has been proven wrong time and time again.
Thank you for letting me know about your experience. Journaling is a great way to process your thoughts and emotions. Please make a note of the details in your journal, and I look forward to discussing it with you during our next session and providing any support or advice I can offer.
I can understand how losing that pattern can be stressful for you. It's important to recognize that patterns can change over time and may need adjustments. To help regain your sense of focus and motivation, try breaking down your goals into smaller, achievable tasks, and find new routines or activities that bring a sense of purpose. Remember, it's completely normal to experience changes in our life patterns, and with some effort, you can build a new pattern that works for you. Is there any specific aspect of your previous pattern that you would like to focus on regaining?
I understand that you're struggling with your writing and feeling despair over not being able to bring your thoughts together. In our session today, we discussed gaining a clearer focus so you can get back to your work and research, and I believe your contributions will be important. As we wrap up, I'd like to ask for some feedback on our meeting. Was there anything specifically helpful or something you'd like to discuss further?
As the counsellor, I want to ensure that you feel heard, understood, and respected in our sessions. I genuinely care about addressing your goals and focusing on the topics you find important. It's crucial that we work together using an approach that suits you and helps us achieve the intended outcomes. Please let me know if you have any concerns or feel that something isn't fitting well, so we can adjust accordingly and make the therapy process as effective as possible.
I understand that work can be challenging and stressful at times. It's great that you're able to identify your stress levels. Since your stress seems to be mostly coming from work, let's discuss some strategies that can help manage your stress in that area.

Thank you for sharing the information, and I appreciate the effort you put into measuring the lines and writing the number. It's fine that you already did the work, and you can keep the paper if you'd like. However, if you prefer, I can keep it for records. It's essential to track progress, so keeping it in an organized place is important. What do you think is the best option?
It's great to see that you've made progress and your score has increased to 12. Improvement is a positive sign towards your overall well-being. Keep working on your goals and let me know if you have any concerns or need further guidance.
It's great to hear that you are experiencing some improvement in your situation. From our session two progress, it seems we are on the right track, and your progress is moving upward. Keep up the positive momentum, and let's continue working together to achieve further improvement.
It's possible that the patterns you're looking for might not be as obvious as you think. Try being more open to recognizing patterns that may come to you at unexpected moments, even while doing everyday tasks like eating dinner. Keep in mind that the pattern you eventually identify might be different than what you initially expected, but nonetheless, it is still a pattern. Does this make sense to you?
Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're going through a challenging time right now, and it's natural to feel lost and overwhelmed in such situations. To better understand your situation, may I ask: has there been any recent event or change in your life that you think might be contributing to these feelings?
Of course, I can help you with the scoring system. Low scores should be marked to the left, and high scores to the right. A score of four would be somewhere in between. Let me know if you have any other concerns, and we can work through them together.
It's important to address these concerns in your relationships. You may want to try communicating your feelings to your family and close friends, and work together to find ways to bridge the gap. Remember, it takes time and effort from both sides to maintain healthy relationships. If you'd like, I can provide some suggestions on how to improve your communication and develop deeper connections with your loved ones.
It sounds like you've been struggling with punctuality for the past two or three weeks. Before that, you were getting up on time. Can you think of any changes in your life or routines that might be contributing to this issue?
It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated with how your research is progressing.

It sounds like you were close to a breakthrough but couldn't quite reach it due to time constraints. It's natural to feel frustrated in such situations. To help you regain that pattern or clarity, try revisiting your previous thought process and the steps you took before you had to leave. It might also help to take a step back, relax, and let your mind refresh before trying to find the pattern again. Remember, sometimes solutions come to us when we least expect it.
It sounds like you're feeling stressed about missing work hours due to a recurring pattern. Can you please tell me more about this pattern and why it's causing you to stay at home? This information will help me better understand your situation and provide appropriate guidance.
As your counsellor, my primary goal is to ensure that you feel comfortable and supported during this process. If you don't want to fill out the form, that's perfectly fine. We can discuss your feelings and emotions in a way that you feel comfortable with. Remember, this is about helping you and the purpose of our sessions is to focus on your needs, be it individually or in your relationships, social life, and work.
I understand your concerns about the form's history. Let me clarify that this form is confidential and only authorized personnel will have access to it. If you are still uncomfortable, would you like us to discuss these concerns in more detail or find an alternate way to record your information?
I understand your concerns about the paper and its potential contact with other people. How about we try a different approach? Instead of you handling the paper, I can ask you the questions and mark the answers for you. Does that sound alright to you?

Take some time to think about the improvements you've made and how close they are to your overall goal.

You're in the right place, and I'm glad your friend directed you to us. We have been operating as a free clinic here in this neighborhood for almost 17 years. We work mainly with people from the area, providing help using an approach that is different from some other places. If there's anything you would like to discuss or need support with, feel free to share, and I'm here to help.
I understand your concern about anonymity in therapy. The form that Scott mentioned is for tracking your progress in different areas of your life. This helps customize therapy to best suit your needs. You don't have to put your name on it and be assured that therapists handle client information with confidentiality. The form would be kept in a secure manner, either in locked filing cabinets or password-protected computer files. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask.
It's okay, we all have moments when we struggle to find the right words. Take your time and try to rephrase it if you feel more comfortable doing so. I am here to listen and understand your thoughts and feelings.
As a counsellor, I understand your concern about the progress. It's important for us to regularly track the scores and see the improvement over time. If the scores don't go up as expected, we'll have a discussion to figure out what else I need to do or which additional ideas I can provide to help you improve further.
Of course! The lines represent different aspects of the therapeutic process, and they're designed to help both of us monitor our progress. The big, thick dashed line is a key component, showing certain milestones. However, remember that you're in control, and you can decide the direction of our sessions. If you want to bring in colleagues for consultation or adjust the pace, just let me know.
It's great that you've recognized the need for change and taken the initiative to do a self-assessment.

It's great that you're focused on personal growth and learning through your research. Working alone can sometimes be isolating, so it's important to find balance and ensure you maintain your emotional well-being. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need support, don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or seek professional help.

However, I understand your concern if neither of you gets hired at Home Depot. Can you think of any alternative options for transportation or discuss with Jacob to find a solution together?
It's common for some people not to share every aspect of their lives. However, if you feel concerned about Jacob's work or would like to know more, it may be helpful to open up a conversation with him about it. Remember, good communication is key to building trust and understanding in any relationship.

Give yourself the space and time to explore different angles instead of stressing out too much.

As your counsellor, I apologize if my previous approach didn't work well for you. I was trying to connect with you by resonating with your presumed attitude, but it's clear that it didn't have the desired effect.

Your feedback is important to make this a productive experience for both of us.

It's understandable that you wanted to have a more engaging conversation, but it's okay that it didn't turn out as you expected.

Instead of focusing on this one experience, consider it a learning opportunity and think about ways to improve future interactions. If you're comfortable sharing, can you let me know more about why you felt the need to say something witty?
It's understandable that you might be feeling uncertain about her response. It's possible that she was genuinely busy on Friday, or she might not be interested in going out with you.

This way, you can gauge her interest while being respectful of her time.

It's normal for people to feel like they have different aspects of their personality.

It's interesting that you mention the trouble you had with the principal when you were eleven, and then the poor treatment you received from the therapists. But, you also say it doesn't matter. There seems to be a contradiction in how you perceive these events. On one hand, you describe them as 'terrible,' yet on the other, you downplay their significance. Can you help me understand why you feel this way about these experiences?
I understand why you might feel betrayed by your friend for telling the principal. It's important to differentiate between the two issues: the smoking itself, and your friend's choice to share that information. As an analytical person, you might want to consider why your friend felt the need to tell your principal and how it affects your relationship. Remember that no one's self-insight is perfect, so it's essential to remain open to new perspectives and growth. Is there any particular reason you wanted to share this incident with me?

That's completely normal. In therapy, we do focus on you. So, let's begin by discussing your habits of mind, what influences your thoughts, actions, and how you perceive situations.

As a counsellor, I understand that you're interpreting her response in a very absolute manner. However, it's important to consider that people's feelings and thoughts can change over time.

Is there any specific situation or incident that triggered this feeling of rejection?
As the counsellor, I acknowledge your awareness of the issue and understand the reason for your suggestion. I appreciate your honesty and the growth you've made in recognizing your thought patterns. Instead of focusing on mistrust, let's work together on improving your judgment-making abilities and develop a stronger trust in yourself and your perceptions.
It's great that you've accepted the recognition of your positive qualities, and your concern about implementing change is understandable. Change may not be instant, but insight can be a starting point. You can take one step at a time; reflect on your thoughts and actions, and gradually integrate your unique qualities into daily life in a balanced and effective manner. Don't be too hard on yourself; change takes time and patience.
Ah, the reason I think it is, is because, you're not going to like this but I'm gonna tell you the answer to your question anyway. It's likely that you have issues with self-esteem or self-worth, which make it difficult for you to accept compliments. You might feel that you don't deserve the praise, or you might be uncomfortable with the attention it brings. It's important to work on building your self-confidence and accepting compliments as a healthy part of social interactions.
It's great that you are making an effort to get out of the house daily, as it can indeed be beneficial for your mental health. How do you typically spend your time when you're outdoors?
I believe it's important not to view therapy as an on or off situation, but I understand if you want it to be like that. I would like to remind you of your power to work through barriers and not completely disregard therapy if a problem arises in the future. Leaving the option open-ended might be beneficial.
As a counsellor, I believe that therapy isn't an on or off thing, but rather an availability when you need it. We could consider tapering off and scheduling sessions less frequently, such as once a month. That way, you'll still have access to help whenever needed while adjusting to a less frequent schedule.
That sounds like a reasonable plan. We can schedule monthly sessions to help in your transition, monitor your progress, and address any concerns you might have. Ensuring that you feel comfortable and confident in managing on your own is our main priority. Let's move forward with this plan and assess its effectiveness as we go.
It sounds like you're experiencing a change in your ability to interact and navigate social situations comfortably. Could there be something specific that happened recently that triggered this change in you? Remember, it's completely normal to have ups and downs, and finding the root cause can help you address and work through this situation.
I understand how distressing and immobilizing this can be for you. I would like to help you address this issue if you're willing to share more information. Could you please explain the situation or task that you're struggling with?
It seems like you expressed your disagreement with Bob's campaign idea and offered an alternative viewpoint, aiming at a better outcome.

How has your working relationship with Bob been before this interaction?
It's understandable to feel worried about feeling left out of important conversations at work. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions about what they were discussing without any concrete information. Instead, try to focus on your own tasks and keep an open line of communication with your boss and coworkers. If there's something you need to be aware of or involved in, trust that they will include you when necessary.
I understand that being caught in a lie can be uncomfortable. It's important to acknowledge when we make mistakes or feel vulnerable. It's a learning experience for both of us.

It's great to hear that you had an interesting experience at the party! Remember, it's essential to enjoy yourself and maintain a balance in your social life. However, don't forget your progress and personal growth during these experiences. Is there anything, in particular, you'd like to share about your party experience?
It's great that you can empathize with the girl and understand the feeling of being an outsider. Keep in mind that putting yourself in someone else's shoes can help you better navigate social situations. Try to be more genuine and consistent with your cues when engaging in conversations to make the experience more enjoyable for both parties.
I understand that you want to protect yourself by not confronting your boss. It's true that it can be a practical decision, but it's important to evaluate the situation and determine if not addressing the issue could lead to feelings of defeat or resentment. You may want to consider alternative ways to address the issue without risking your job. Can you think of any other approach that might work?
It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of powerlessness and difficulty in differentiating between the people in your life.

It sounds like you're frustrated with your sister's decision to return to her husband during a difficult time. Can you help me understand your concerns about her choice, and what specifically is bothering you about her decision?
So, she feels she can't handle the situation, does she love him too much? Does she feel insecure without him? Maybe she needs the routines, feeling secure in the familiarity of the relationship, despite the challenges. It's important for her to understand her own needs and consider alternative ways to find stability and security in her life.
It's important to communicate with people when you have concerns. As a counsellor, I suggest you express your feelings and thoughts in a calm and respectful manner, focusing on the issue rather than the person. However, if this person responds negatively, remember that it's your apartment, and you have the right to stand up for yourself. (laughs) Your sense of humor can also help in easing the tension.
As a counsellor, I appreciate your effort in trying to communicate humor to others, but it might not be the most effective way. Instead, consider working on your delivery and observing how others use tone, facial expressions, and timing to convey humor. Practice, and over time, you'll feel more comfortable expressing humor without relying on gestures.
It's important to maintain a good working relationship with your boss, but it's also essential to express your thoughts and opinions in a constructive manner. You can try to find ways to communicate your ideas without being confrontational. It might be helpful to practice assertive communication techniques so you can share your views without compromising your professional relationships. Do you have any specific situations where you feel particularly uncomfortable expressing yourself?
It seems that you are trying to avoid conflict by withholding your thoughts and feelings from others.

Let's explore the other side of you, the one that cares for others deeply, and try to identify ways in which you can express your thoughts without causing harm to your relationships.
As the counsellor, I understand your concern about the exercises, and it's okay to find them silly. These exercises are designed to help you express your thoughts and emotions in a safe and open environment. They also help us to establish trust between us and understand each other better.

Please tell me more about your thoughts and feelings, as it will help me understand your perspective and provide better assistance. Let's work together to figure out what's going on.
It's common for people to feel uncertain or uncomfortable about sharing their thoughts and feelings, and sometimes that leads to lying. The fact that you recognize this behavior in yourself is a positive step towards addressing it. To better understand why you choose to lie in certain situations, try reflecting on the emotions or fears that might be driving this behavior. If you'd like, you can share more about a specific situation where this has occurred, and we can discuss it further.
It seems like you might be experiencing some resistance or fear towards going out, even though you're capable of doing so. Can you tell me what is the main reason that's holding you back from going out with Suzanne?

Since you are aware of your know-it-all tendencies, I'd like to ask if you feel that it has affected your relationships with others or other areas in your life?
It's never too early to ask questions. I'm here to help you, so please feel free to share any concerns or doubts you might have about therapy. What specifically would you like to know?
I understand that change may seem difficult, especially after a long time. As a counsellor, I won't just give you a simple statement and expect everything to change immediately. We will work together, explore your thoughts and feelings, and develop a plan to help you make gradual and lasting changes in your life. It's a process that requires patience and commitment, but I am here to support and guide you throughout your journey.
It's okay if you don't know exactly what the dork would say. Let's try to work through it together. Put yourself in the dork's shoes for a moment and think: if you were the dork, how would you handle this situation? Would you try to respond with humor, ignore the hipster's comment, or come up with a clever retort to prove you're not easily intimidated?
It seems that you might be feeling vulnerable and fearful in the dork's role. It could be that you're emphasizing with the dork's feelings of rejection and insecurity as the hipster's words could be hurtful. How do you feel about playing the dork and being rejected by the hipster?

It seems like you have a tendency to get very attached and connected quickly in relationships, which can ultimately lead to hurt feelings when things end.

Have you thought about any specific reasons why you tend to jump into relationships so quickly?

If you feel comfortable, can you share more about what you think might have led to this change in her behavior?

Weighing the pros and cons might help you make a more informed decision that's right for both of you.
As a counsellor, I appreciate your honesty in recognizing this pattern. It's important to maintain a balance between excitement and awareness in a relationship. Setting boundaries and keeping an open line of communication with your partner can help you address any concerns before they escalate. Can you think of any specific red flags you may have missed in past relationships?

This process will help you develop a healthier approach to relationships and learn to be more comfortable with yourself.

If it works, continuing the experiment could improve your relationship with your mom and overall home and school life. As for joining Dr. Murphy's helper club, think about the benefits of sharing your experiences and helping others before making a decision. Do you have any specific concerns about joining the helper club?
I understand that it can be challenging to discuss financial issues with a partner. It's important to focus on timing and receptiveness when bringing up such discussions. You could try talking to your partner tonight but also consider alternative options in case the conversation doesn't go well. When approaching him, be mindful of his mood and try to engage in a respectful and calm manner. Remember, it's crucial to express your concerns and feelings while acknowledging his perspective. Are there any particular topics that you feel most worried about discussing with him?
It's completely understandable to feel hesitant about discussing certain topics with your partner, especially if you're not ready for that conversation yet. It's great that you're willing to talk about spending, though. Perhaps you can start by addressing the spending topic and set healthy boundaries for further discussions, ensuring that you only engage in conversations you feel comfortable with at this time.
It sounds like you've identified some key indicators that show when your partner is more open to discussing any financial concerns. When you notice these signs, it could be a good time to approach the conversation in a gentle and supportive manner. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss with your partner regarding finances that might help you both feel more at ease in these conversations?
It seems like you are gradually getting accustomed to the group and finding it helpful to visually see the skills discussed. It's natural to still be learning at this stage. Observing the newcomers can offer you valuable perspective and a sense of progress. As you continue attending the sessions, try to focus on your own growth and apply the skills you learn to your personal situation. Is there any particular skill that you have found most helpful so far or want to learn more about?
It's great to hear that you applied the opposite to emotion skill this week. By going to the group, even though you didn't feel like it at first, you were able to honor your commitments and showed great progress. Do you feel like this way of coping with emotions has been helpful for you during the week?
I'm glad to hear that the opposite to emotion technique is helping you with honoring your commitments. This skill can be applied to many areas of your life, such as managing negative emotions in relationships, overcoming procrastination, or facing challenging situations. To better understand how you can benefit, can you think of a specific situation where your emotions were interfering with your decision making or actions?
I'm glad you found the mindfulness and deep breathing exercise relaxing, Laura. It's important to remember that practicing mindfulness and taking breaks like this can be an essential tool to anchor ourselves in the present moment. I encourage you to make an effort to incorporate these practices in your daily life, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. Can you think of a specific time during the day when you could practice mindfulness?
It's interesting that this particular breathing technique felt more helpful in relaxation rather than causing anxiety. It might be because the process of stopping and exhaling provides a sense of control in the exercise. However, it's essential to remember that the feeling of it taking a longer time can act as a reminder of how a short moment can have a significant impact on our well-being. Would you like to explore more about your experience with anxiety during breathing exercises?
As a counsellor, I appreciate your willingness to follow these steps. By observing and describing your distress levels before and after positive activities, it will help you to understand the impact of these activities on your well-being. Additionally, cross-referencing your chain analysis with the BOR safety plan will aid you in identifying patterns and triggers, ultimately assisting you in managing your emotions effectively. Please, let me know if you notice any differences in your distress levels next week.
It's great to hear that you're open to giving therapy a chance. It's common for individuals to feel uncertain about whether therapy will help them or not.

It seems like your counsellor believes it's important for you to practice mindfulness and breathing exercises, especially in a beautiful and peaceful environment. Perhaps, they think it can help you to feel more relaxed and grounded after your session. Are you comfortable with following their suggestion and do you feel it might benefit you?
It's great to hear that you had a positive counseling session. It's important to maintain a good relationship with your counsellor as it fosters a supportive environment for your personal growth. Since you didn't mention any specific issues, I assume things are going well. Remember to address any concerns you might have with your counsellor during your upcoming session. Take care!
I understand that discussing certain topics can be uncomfortable, but it's important to address them in order to make progress in therapy. It's great that you have a safety plan in place. I encourage you to update it with the new skills you've learned, as they can be helpful in managing difficult situations. Remember, we can control the pace of our conversations and spend as much or as little time on a topic as you feel comfortable with.
I understand that you've acted on your SAB and it's a significant concern for you. We will be working on a chain analysis to understand the situation better and develop strategies to handle such instances in the future. Remember to update your safety plan with newly acquired skills throughout the week. If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask someone in the skills group or myself.
As your counsellor, I understand that you might not be very comfortable with the process yet. The reason for asking you to fill out the forms at home and bring them partially completed is to help you practice self-awareness and reflection. This can be an essential step towards understanding your thoughts and feelings. Don't worry; I'll be here to guide and support you in this process. Just take it one step at a time, and soon it will become familiar and helpful for you.
As a counsellor, I completely understand your concern and yes, we can definitely focus on positive behaviors during our sessions. It's essential to acknowledge and work on the positive aspects of your life while addressing the challenges. This will help create a balanced perspective and facilitate growth.
It's great to hear that you had a positive experience at the beach. For our next session, we can consider analyzing other effective behaviors that you've engaged in recently. We can then discuss their possible triggers and consequences in order to build your self-awareness and explore more options for beneficial activities. I would also like to give you a few assignments for the week to help you continue improving.
It's great that you are considering finding positive experiences like walking your dog! Doing it before group on Monday is a good start. Can you think of one more positive experience you could commit to, in addition to walking your dog three times per week?
It seems like you have some available time but you're uncertain about how to use it effectively. One idea could be to find a good book that can engage your interest, which might help you feel more motivated. If you're unsure about going to the beach, consider trying to explore other activities or places that could make use of your free time. Is there any specific reason why you're uncertain about going to the beach?
You could put it in a box in the laundry room, which would create more barriers between you and it, making it more difficult for you to access. By creating these additional barriers and developing new coping strategies, such as self-soothing and distraction, you can effectively prevent yourself from dealing with those negative outcomes you don't like as much. Consider trying this approach and see if it helps minimize the impact of those negative outcomes.
It's understandable that you were startled and had a range of emotions because of the disturbance, especially if it's a recurring issue. You mentioned this happens consistently on Thursdays and Saturdays. Can you provide more context about what your partner is doing and how it has been affecting you?
It's important to observe both surface and underlying emotions. Since you've identified anger and frustration, try to reflect on potential triggers, related thoughts, and physical sensations that might be accompanying these emotions. Can you recall having any other thoughts, physical reactions, or emotions at that time?
It's understandable that you'd feel disrespected and hurt in this situation. It's a natural reaction to feel that way when your partner's behavior indicates a lack of respect and care for the relationship. Addressing the issue with him is important, but it might be more productive to have this conversation when he's sober and more open to understanding your feelings.
It's normal to have concerns about the future of a relationship, and it's okay to not want to delve deep into it right now. We can instead focus on identifying areas where you can make better choices and develop skills to improve your relationship's dynamic in case similar situations arise again. Can you think of any areas where there's room for growth or change?
I understand sleep issues can cause difficulties in daily life. I have a handout on establishing a healthy sleep routine that I'll give you, containing lots of suggestions on improving sleep without using medication. This should help you work on going to bed earlier and getting better quality sleep. Is there anything else that's impacting your sleep that you'd like to address?
It's great that you're open to exploring other options. Ambien can be helpful as needed, but it's also important to work on behavioral strategies to manage your situation. I will provide you with a handout on alternative methods when we leave today.
It's good that you're open to discussing finances with your partner. When having this conversation, try to do it when he's sober and in a calm environment. You could suggest creating a budget together to manage your expenses better. If you're worried about his reaction to separating finances, approach the topic gently and emphasize the need for financial stability for both of you. Remember to stay calm and supportive throughout the discussion.
It is understandable that you feel worried and vulnerable with the current financial situation and job uncertainty. It's essential to address your concerns and have open communication with your husband about the financial situation and his spending habits. Having a plan in place to help you manage your finances and cope with potential job loss might ease your anxiety. And remember, it's absolutely normal to feel stressed under these circumstances, but seeking necessary support and not keeping it bottled up is crucial.
It's understandable that financial stress can affect your relationship with your partner. It's important to acknowledge your concerns and try not to be too reactive. It's okay to take your time in addressing this issue with Kevin, but at some point, having a conversation about your financial concerns and its impact on your relationship might be helpful. Maybe you could consider seeking couple's therapy for support in navigating this difficult situation.
It's great to hear that you're open to trying new methods of self-soothing. Journaling can be helpful for some people, as it allows them to express their thoughts and emotions in a constructive way. However, what works best for you may vary. I suggest giving journaling a try and seeing if it resonates with you. If not, you can always explore other options like taking a shower or trying other self-soothe techniques.
It's great that you're taking steps to avoid self-harming behaviors. One idea you could consider is finding an alternative activity that helps you cope with your emotions. You can also try to eliminate access to the tools you use for self-harm. For instance, if the tools are in a drawer, maybe you could rearrange the items in that drawer, so you're less likely to come across them or have someone else remove them for you. Does that sound feasible for you?
I understand that you might not be ready to get rid of the razor or move it out of the bathroom. However, creating additional barriers can be helpful in preventing impulsive actions. As your counsellor, I would suggest finding a more distant location for the razor or considering other coping strategies for when you feel an urge to self-harm.
It's great that you recognize the barrier and are willing to think about it. Identifying and acknowledging the obstacle is the first step to overcoming it. To better understand your situation, could you please explain what specifically is the barrier you are facing, and what have you tried so far to overcome it?
It sounds like you're really struggling with feelings of guilt and discomfort due to not being honest with someone. Can you provide more details on what is causing these feelings and why you're lying to this person?
It's important that you feel accepted and affirmed here in the office and within the school. I understand that gay youth can face challenges, like homelessness, due to fear and lack of acceptance. To better understand your situation, I am curious if you know other young gay men who have come out to their parents, and what their experiences were like.
I understand that it's a challenging situation, wanting to make both yourself and your mother happy. It's important to remember that everyone's situation and family dynamics are different. Consider having an open and honest conversation with your parents about your feelings and concerns. Keep in mind that it's your life, and you deserve to be true to yourself and happy.
It is understandable to feel anxious about rejection, especially after learning about someone else's negative experience. One thing I would like you to do is to explore and connect with other people, either through the internet or any support groups in your school. This can help you gain more insight and build relationships that could help you overcome your fear of rejection.
I understand that coming out to your parents and maintaining your cultural values is a delicate and challenging process. It's important to consider factors such as timing, communication style, and possible support systems when having this conversation. You might want to share your personal experience, while also acknowledging the cultural perspective your parents might have. Including stories of other LGBTQ+ individuals who have successfully navigated this process within your culture could be helpful as well. Remember, there's no right or wrong way to come out - the most important thing is to be true to yourself while remaining respectful and sensitive to your parents' beliefs.
It's important to acknowledge and affirm who you are while also understanding that your mother needs to grieve in her own way. As her child, it might be challenging to step away, but remember that her feelings are hers to process. I can definitely provide you with some helpful resources, such as coming out books that take into account cultural and ethnic backgrounds. This might help you navigate your feelings and experiences better during this time.
I understand your concern. There is a book called 'Coming Out With Love' that shares stories of other youths coming out to their families in a positive and supportive manner. Reading this book might give you some ideas and help reinforce your belief that the coming out process can be handled well. We can discuss this topic more in our next session if you would like.
I understand how difficult it can be to manage stress and anxiety. It's important to develop healthy coping mechanisms, like practicing relaxation techniques (deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation), setting realistic goals, breaking tasks into smaller steps, and taking regular breaks. Additionally, regular exercise, healthy eating habits, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule can also help. If you still find it difficult to manage, consider seeking professional help. Are there any specific situations that are causing you more anxiety?
I understand that you're feeling off centered and struggling to find something to focus on. In the past, being decisive has helped you regain your sense of center. It's important to find something you can set your sights on and work towards. So, what's one thing you can decide to do right now that might help you feel more centered?
It's great to hear that you feel satisfaction when completing tasks, but it seems like technology can sometimes add to your stress. One suggestion is to try limiting the number of time management apps you use or setting a specific time to check them. What do you think of this approach?
It's great that you're taking initiative to organize your projects. While finding the right app may be helpful, remember that an app is just a tool. Ultimately, it's up to you to prioritize and complete your tasks efficiently. If you're feeling overwhelmed, perhaps try breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Also, consider evaluating the apps you've already downloaded instead of constantly searching for new ones.
I can understand how feeling like you can't live up to your family's expectations can be challenging. It's great that you have your father as a guardian angel figure in your life. As you continue to work on being open to relationships, think of him as your at-home co-therapist, keeping you on the right path. If you have any concerns or questions that we haven't addressed yet, please feel free to share them.
It's understandable to have doubts and concerns about memory loss. One suggestion is to write down reminders or put them in your project management system to keep track of your progress. Also, regularly reflecting upon past experiences and effective relationships can be beneficial for your overall well-being.
It's great to hear that you're working on a change and that you're aware it takes time for things to become automatic. Remember to be patient with yourself during this process. As you've expressed willingness to discuss your situation, I encourage you to share it with others, as doing so can provide you with valuable insights and support from people who may have gone through similar experiences.
It sounds like your father had a profound impact on your life and taught you valuable lessons about accepting mistakes and the true nature of love. It's important to remember his wisdom and focus on your own well-being and self-acceptance. As you said, we are attracted to people because of their hearts, souls, and beings more than their physical appearances. Embrace your true self and remember that you are worthy of love and happiness, no matter what.
It seems like you were trying to access your instruments for a valid reason, but it led to an issue with the police. It's important to consider the consequences of your actions and discuss it with a responsible adult if you're not sure. How has this incident affected your relationship with your friends and your feelings about what happened?
The question is, what have you learned in your life about when you closed off the possibilities, or when you were distracting yourself away from what you really needed to be doing or focusing on? How could you apply this knowledge now? Perhaps you could share some instances where, when you were centered and focused on your personal goals like your studies or career, and how that impacted your relationships and overall peace with where you were in the moment.
It sounds like you experienced two very different relationships - one that felt easy and natural, and another that started more casually. It's natural to feel sad about the first relationship ending, but it's important to remember that each relationship teaches us something new about ourselves and what we need in a partner. In terms of your ex-wife, it might be helpful to ask yourself what qualities initially attracted you to her and whether those qualities are still important to you now. Reflecting on these questions can help you better understand your needs and expectations in future relationships.
It seems like your view of yourself has changed due to the feedback you've received while online dating. It's important to remember that everyone has different preferences, and your height does not define your worth. You mentioned earlier that you were hardworking, trustworthy, and had high integrity, which are all excellent qualities to have. Try focusing on those positive aspects of yourself, as these are what make you unique and valuable, rather than just your physical appearance.
It seems like your productivity during your father's illness might have been a coping mechanism to deal with the pain and denial associated with his cancer. It's a tough situation, and it's understandable that you would find a way to distract yourself during that difficult time. Your shyness might have played a role in your decision to focus more on academics than dating at that stage in life. It's important to recognize and acknowledge these feelings, so that you can better understand your own coping mechanisms and continue to grow.
It sounds like you've been through some challenging experiences, juggling your work, school, and personal life. The end of your engagement must have been difficult, and it's important to acknowledge and process your feelings about your father's death as well. Let's explore this further: How has your father's death been affecting your overall emotions and life choices?
It sounds like you and your former wife had an instant connection when you first met and your relationship developed quickly. Can you share more about what made you feel so connected to her and if there were any challenges you faced in the relationship?
It's understandable to feel discouraged when comparing yourself to others in a competitive setting. However, it's commendable that you challenged yourself and recognized your progress. Try to focus on your own journey and growth, rather than comparing yourself to others. As you continue to develop your skills, remember that setbacks and challenges are a natural part of the process. It's okay to decline opportunities that don't align with your abilities or goals. Keep pushing yourself and take pride in your accomplishments.
It seems like you've been through a very challenging and emotionally-draining period in your life. You had to navigate through the intensity of a divorce and take on the sole responsibility of raising your children while juggling personal and professional matters. That can be incredibly overwhelming and disorienting. However, it's important to recognize the resilience you've demonstrated in caring for your kids and rebuilding your life after the divorce. How have you been coping with the stress and emotions lately, and are there any specific sources of support or methods you've been using to help you through this journey?
It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, managing both work and your children's care. This can be quite overwhelming and tiring. Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family or support networks to help you in balancing these responsibilities. It's essential to take the time for yourself too, to relax and manage your stress levels. Is there a specific concern that's bothering you more?
It's important to recognize that your sense of self-worth is being affected by these experiences. It's possible that the online environment may not be the best for you, but the main concern is regaining your confidence. I encourage you to reflect on your strengths and work on rebuilding your self-esteem, whether you decide to stay online or engage with others offline. Stay true to your values as a trustworthy person and focus on how to overcome this self-doubt.
It's great to hear that being in the marching band had a positive impact on you during your time at Florida State University. It's important to recognize and celebrate our achievements. Can you think of any specific ways that being part of the marching band has helped you grow or learn new skills?
It's natural for a parent to want to protect their children from any harm or struggles. However, life does present challenges, and it's important to remember that facing these difficulties can lead to growth and character development, just like in your own personal experiences. While it may not have gone as planned, it seems that these experiences have brought you and your children closer together in some ways, which can be a positive outcome. It's important to focus on supporting them and helping them navigate through the challenges life presents.
I'm glad you completed the assignment and shared your observations with me. It's important to understand that everyone has imperfections, yet this doesn't prevent them from being in loving relationships. Self-criticism can be damaging, so remind yourself of your own value and know that someone will love you for who you are. Focus on self-improvement and self-love to build confidence in yourself and your relationships. Do you feel any different after completing this assignment?
Thank you for sharing this story about your father, it helps me better understand your background and relationship with him. It sounds like these trips to the store were special bonding moments between you two. Is there a particular lesson or piece of advice from your father that has stayed with you throughout the years that you believe would be relevant to the topic of our discussion?
It seems your father was trying to teach you an important lesson about love and acceptance. If he were here now, he might say to focus on the love and connection you shared, and remember that everyone makes mistakes. Instead of dwelling on the frustrations, try to practice empathy and understanding in your relationships. Is there a specific situation or relationship that you're struggling with right now where you can apply this lesson?
It's great that you have received advice to trust yourself, as self-trust can be an essential aspect of personal growth and decision-making. In this context, can you give me an example of a similar situation where you've trusted yourself and it helped you to make the right choice?
It's great to acknowledge the importance of being centered and getting out of the office for your projects. Being centered can positively impact your overall well-being and productivity. When you're more present and mindful, you're likely to create better connections with others and discover new opportunities. Being open to new experiences and stepping outside of your comfort zone can lead to personal growth and a more fulfilling life. Remember, it's about finding a balance and allowing yourself to be present in your daily activities.
It's understandable that you feel nervous about stepping out of your comfort zone. Based on your past success with this strategy, it's worth considering trying it again. Don't completely abandon your current coping mechanisms, but supplement them with new experiences and connections. This may provide you with a better perspective on your situation and potentially help you feel happier and more focused.
It's good to hear that you have made progress in your personal life. It's natural to worry about the impact of past difficulties on your children. Have you considered seeking professional help for your kids to address any lingering issues they might be facing?
It's normal to feel concerned about your children's well-being, but you're right that these experiences contribute to their personal growth. As Dr. Erickson mentioned, we can consider the troubles of life as roughage, an essential part of our development. Remember, you can provide support and guidance for your kids, but it's also important to let them learn and grow from their experiences. If there's a specific worry that's been bothering you lately, feel free to share it with me.
It's great to acknowledge that. One way to help you feel more relaxed and less defensive is by practicing open communication. Let's try expressing your feelings or thoughts whenever you feel defensive, so we can better understand each other and work towards making you feel comfortable.
As a counsellor, I acknowledge your feelings and understand that being called a phony can be hurtful. It's important to remember that everyone has different ways of dealing with embarrassment, and smiling may be your coping mechanism. It doesn't necessarily mean you're being insincere. Focus on expressing your true feelings and try not to worry too much about other's judgments. In what other situations do you find yourself feeling embarrassed?
I apologize if it feels like I'm picking on you, that's not my intention. It's helpful to know how you're experiencing our conversation. Let's take a moment to start fresh and focus on your feelings. If you could express your feelings through a movement or action, what would that be like for you?
It sounds like you're feeling scared and vulnerable, and using laughter as a way to cope. I want to assure you that my intention is to support and help you, not to attack you. Can you tell me more about the corner you'd like to be in, where you feel completely protected?
It sounds like you're experiencing a similar feeling of safety in a corner as you did when you were a child. It's important to recognize that you are not a little girl anymore, but I'm wondering if the corner provides a sense of comfort due to its familiarity. Can you think of ways to create a sense of safety and comfort in other situations, without relying on a corner?
It's important to recognize that you're feeling afraid and defensive. However, I'm here to support you and help you work through any issues you are facing. It is natural to feel vulnerable in a counselling environment. Can you share more about what this feeling reminds you of? It might help us to understand the underlying emotions or past experiences that are causing this fear.
It's quite common to compare ourselves with others and feel inadequate at times. However, constantly feeling inferior is not healthy. Remember that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and having all the right answers is not a measure of one's worth. It's essential to focus on personal growth and self-acceptance. Is there a specific situation where you felt this way recently?
It appears that you have a desire for more respect from others which may be rooted in your relationship with your father. Can you think of any specific instances in your life where you felt disrespected and how it affected you?
It seems like you rely on others to rescue you from difficult situations, and you feel I'm not supportive. If you find yourself in a tight spot, wouldn't it be more empowering to muster the courage to get out on your own, rather than expecting someone else to always pull you out?
I apologize if my earlier statement made you feel judged. It's important to recognize and understand our vulnerabilities. However, I want to encourage you to find your own strength and not solely rely on others for your growth. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, but finding a balance between self-reliance and support is crucial for personal development.
As a counsellor, my aim is to help you, not judge you. It's important to focus on your feelings and thoughts, rather than trying to guess what I think. It's natural to feel insecure or defensive, but let's work together to explore your thoughts and emotions without making assumptions about each other. Can you tell me more about why you feel the need to label yourself as a phony?
I apologize if it seems that way. I have observed some of your actions, but I am not claiming to know all the answers. As a counsellor, it's my job to observe and understand your behavior. If you feel uncomfortable, please let me know how I can better support you.
I understand your concern. I didn't actually ask you to explain your behavior, but rather just observed what you were doing. It's important to separate my observations from your interpretation or imagination. Please continue expressing yourself and remember that I'm here to support and help you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts. It seems like there could be a misunderstanding between you and the counsellor regarding the comment about playing stupid. As a counsellor, it is important for me to understand your actions and expressions better – so, could you kindly provide more context or explain what you meant by doing something with your hair?
As the counsellor, I agree with you that we have reached a nice closure and gained some understanding in this session. It is indeed a good point to wrap up our conversation. Remember, you can always reach out if you need further assistance. Take care and be well!
As a counsellor, I understand that you feel this way, and I apologize if my behavior came across as judgmental. My intention is to help you, not to belittle or hurt your feelings. Though our conversation may involve some games, my ultimate goal is to support you and make a meaningful connection. I want you to feel comfortable and understood. Can you please share more about why you feel I'm being judgmental so I can improve my approach?
It seems like you're frustrated with people who appear overconfident and self-assured, and you desire to bring them down a notch. The distinguished appearance of this person could be adding to your irritation. What elements of their behavior or attitude bother you the most? Reflecting on this may help you better understand your feelings and develop a healthier response to their actions.
I apologize if it seems like I'm not recognizing your feelings. My intent is not to ignore your emotions, but to create a safe space for open communication. I appreciate you sharing your anger with me and your concerns about my detachment. Can you tell me more about why you feel I'm not recognizing you, so I can better understand and address your concerns?
It's great that you're practicing breathing exercises and gaining confidence through talking about your concerns. If you do feel panicked while driving, remember to breathe and remind yourself that it's just your heart racing - you can do this. Let's go over your self-dialogue and practice visualizing yourself successfully managing your nervousness.
It's great that you've been working on coping strategies. Based on what you've learned, it seems like panicking isn't likely to happen, and even if it does, it won't overwhelm you. To manage your feelings while driving, you can stay focused, use your breathing to relax, remind yourself that it's just your heart beating faster, and remember that the anxiety will go away once you get through the situation. If you need to, you can always pull over and calm down before starting again. Would you like to modify any of these strategies or add anything else that might help you feel stronger?
Yes, it seems like you're experiencing PTSD, and seeking counseling is a big step towards overcoming it. There are effective approaches to treat PTSD that have worked for many people. We can discuss your options, and I will also give you a book explaining more about PTSD and its treatment. We can start by talking about your incident in more detail, but you can choose what you want to share. How does that sound to you?
Absolutely, it's important to take breaks and go at your own pace. Remember that you've been able to talk about this with me before and you've made progress. As we continue, I'll periodically ask for a SUDS rating to check how you're feeling. Just share your current anxiety level at that moment, and we'll continue. Don't forget, you can always pause if needed.
Exactly. PTSD can introduce changes in the way that we think about things, and those thoughts can create negative emotional reactions. Since our last session, you got a chance to record some of your self-talk about this issue, right? Let's look at your thoughts about the bank robbery and see if there are any of these biases that may be causing you to stay fearful and avoid reminders of the robbery.
I understand that revisiting a traumatic event can be extremely difficult and scary. It's natural for you to feel scared and avoid thinking about it. However, it's important to recognize that this self-talk is predicting your reaction to the event. Try to view it as a prediction, instead of a certainty. Facing these thoughts and processing the emotions is an important part of healing and moving forward. Remember, it's normal to feel scared, but working through the fear is essential for your well-being.
It's natural to feel nervous about trying something new like Guided Self Dialogue, and your acknowledgement shows self-awareness. We can break the tasks into four steps and identify coping strategies to make it more manageable. Now, how bad would it actually be if you got nervous or even panicked during this process? And what would you want to try to do in those situations?
It's good to have a plan for dealing with anxiety on the road. If you get too nervous, pulling over to calm yourself down can be helpful. Keep in mind that panicking may not be the most likely outcome, but having a plan in place can help put your mind at ease. Is there anything else related to driving that you're worried about?
You're right about being able to discuss the incident with me without losing control, which shows that your fearful prediction is not entirely accurate. It seems like you may be experiencing catastrophizing, a cognitive bias where you predict worst-case scenarios. By recognizing and challenging these biased thoughts, you can work towards managing your emotions better when discussing your traumatic experience.
Catastrophizing after a traumatic experience is common, and it can cause you to overestimate the likelihood of worst-case scenarios happening while discounting your ability to cope. To start overcoming this fear, try replacing the thought of losing control with a more accurate thought like, 'Even if I cry and shake, it will pass. I can pull myself together. I can face these memories in small steps.' This will help you gradually confront your trauma and regain control.
As a counsellor, I understand that adjusting after deployment can be challenging, and it's important to feel welcomed and supported by your community. It's great to find comfort in connections with fellow veterans. Try to attend veteran support groups or engage in activities specifically for veterans to help ease your transition. Don't hesitate to seek professional help if the feelings become overwhelming.
Yes, having a support system of people who share similar experiences can be very beneficial for coping and healing. Since you find comfort in being around other Marine veterans, try seeking out local veterans groups, clubs, or events where you can connect with them on a more regular basis. This could be a positive and impactful way for you to improve your well-being.
I understand your preference to be around fellow marines, as it provides a sense of camaraderie and familiarity. In this case, you may want to explore online community forums or social media groups specifically for marines. This allows you to connect with marines of all ages and backgrounds. Moreover, you can also look into local support groups or consider organizing a meetup for younger marines in your area to create the environment you're seeking. Remember, you are not alone in your journey and there are resources available to help.
It's great that you're getting involved in community programs like Wounded Warrior. As you mentioned, every program has its pros and cons, so it's essential to weigh them based on your needs and preferences. I encourage you to research more about the program, talk to fellow participants, and decide if it's a good fit for you. And if you need any assistance or have any concerns, feel free to reach out to me.
I'm glad that the suggestion of saying 'welcome home' felt more comforting to you. As a counsellor, it's important for me to acknowledge your experiences without making you feel uncomfortable or invalidated. I hope others in your life can also learn to be more sensitive and supportive and avoid asking you intrusive questions. Remember, you are home now and it's time for you to find healing and solace in a safe environment. If there's anything else specific you'd like people to say or do, let me know
It seems like you are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and possibly a traumatic brain injury due to your experiences. These conditions can have a major effect on your physical and neurological functioning. It's important for you to recognize that and not blame yourself. Have you talked to someone about the possibility of experiencing these conditions, and considered seeking treatment options for them?
I understand how frustrating it must be to have side effects from the medication, especially when you have been dedicated to serving your country and helping your peers. It's important to remember that adjusting after returning from the military can be challenging, so it's normal to face some issues. Have you spoken to your doctor about the side effects and the possibility of adjusting the medication to find a better balance for you?
It sounds like you are struggling with acknowledging and experiencing positive emotions, and instead, find it easier to connect with negative feelings like sadness and remorse. It's good that you feel joy when you are with your kids, but it's important to address your negative thoughts about possibly taking opportunities away from others. Have you considered seeking guidance from a therapist, who can help you explore these emotions further and develop healthier coping mechanisms?
It seems like you're experiencing guilt and remorse about your past military service, especially when you see your children enjoying the opportunities that you feel were taken away from others. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and understand that healing takes time. Since it's been impacting you after the birth of your son, have you considered speaking to a therapist or joining a support group for veterans to help process these emotions?
That's a fantastic self-soothing technique! I'm really proud of you for finding something that works for you. It's great to hear that you're able to balance playing guitar with other responsibilities, like being a good parent and focusing on your architecture career. Keep up the good work, and remember that I'm here to support you if you ever need any help or guidance.
It's important to acknowledge the emotional distress you're experiencing due to your experiences as a veteran with PTSD. It's completely valid to feel uncomfortable when people ask insensitive questions or make assumptions about your intentions. I would like to know more about how you cope with these feelings and what support systems you have in place to help you navigate through these difficult situations.
I hear that you're struggling with feelings of guilt and undeservingness due to your actions during your service. It's common for individuals who have experienced trauma or difficult situations to feel this way. It's essential to recognize your feelings and allow yourself to process them. One question I'd like to ask is, have you considered seeking support from a therapist or a support group to help you through this difficult time?
It's great that you've been attending therapy and working on medication management, as those are essential steps in your recovery. EMDR can indeed be very helpful for PTSD, as it helps reprocess traumatic memories and change your perception of them. If you can find a therapist who offers EMDR, it might be a valuable addition to your treatment plan. Additionally, consider talking with other people who share similar experiences, like fellow marines, to establish a support network and explore other coping strategies.
It's fantastic to hear that you've found a healthy and enjoyable coping mechanism through playing guitar, and that it brings joy to your kids as well. The movement you mentioned about involving veterans in guitar playing sounds like a great initiative for supporting mental health. Keep playing and exploring your passion in music, and don't hesitate to reach out if you ever need someone to talk to.
It seems like you're dealing with a lot of complicated emotions and thoughts. It's great that you're pushing through these challenges for your kids. Starting medication is a positive step towards managing your racing thoughts and helping you relax. Have you noticed any improvements since you started taking the medication?
It's important to remember that other people's perceptions of us do not define our true selves. It's great that you are being proactive in creating a positive relationship with your son by participating in activities he enjoys. Focusing on being a loving and supportive presence in his life is a good way to let your true nature shine through, regardless of how others may perceive you.
I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you've been facing. It seems like your PTSD has been affecting various aspects of your life, including your emotional wellbeing and your career. It's important to recognize that you need a support system to discuss your experiences and work on coping strategies. Have you ever considered seeking professional help or joining a support group to address your PTSD and its effect on your life?
It's completely understandable that you're concerned about sharing such personal information with your employer. Since you're not comfortable discussing your therapy sessions, you could simply mention that you have a recurring medical appointment without going into the details of the therapy. This way, you maintain your privacy while meeting your weekly commitments.
It's important to untangle the emotions and meanings behind certain phrases that impact you. It seems you have a deep bond with your fellow service members that goes beyond mere patriotism. It's also natural to struggle with self-perception and the roles you've assumed in the past. As a counsellor, I'm here to help you explore your feelings and reframe your thoughts to better understand yourself and the situations that have shaped you. Is there a specific situation or feeling you'd like to explore further?
As a counsellor, I understand that hyper-alertness can be challenging to manage. However, it's important to remember that this is a skill you acquired during your military service, and it has its positive aspects as well. People around you may appreciate your heightened awareness and ability to detect potential dangers. Try focusing on the positive aspects of this skill and exploring coping strategies to help manage this alertness in day-to-day life.
Thank you for sharing your feelings with me. It's completely normal to feel awkward after discussing personal matters in therapy, especially if it's a new experience for you. It might take some time for you to get comfortable with the process. However, remember that therapy is a safe space for you to express yourself openly. Is there anything specific that made you feel more awkward or uncomfortable in this session?
It sounds like you're experiencing difficulty with trust and self-esteem. It's important to recognize that people's opinions may be genuine and sometimes, hearing them can help you build trust. Would you be willing to give it a try and listen to what someone has to say about you?
I appreciate your willingness to be open and help your fellow brothers and sisters. It's great to see you found value in the 'three don'ts' for talking to veterans, as it can indeed make a significant difference in the way conversations are approached. Is there any particular aspect of your experience that you're still struggling with or would like to share more about?
It's understandable that the reminder of past experiences has triggered uncomfortable feelings, and it's great that you can still focus on your work. Regarding your new job, it might be helpful to remind yourself that you are not your past, and people can change and grow over time. If you feel comfortable in the future and have established a trusting relationship with your colleagues, you can choose to share your experiences as part of your personal growth journey. Remember, you are not alone, and it's normal to feel apprehensive about opening up to others.
It is common for veterans to experience difficulties in relating to others after deployment, as your experiences have been vastly different. It's important to acknowledge the growth and changes you've undergone. You might consider joining a support group for veterans to connect with others who share your experiences. What strategies have you tried to bridge the gap between you and your peers?
I think it's a great idea to explore the Vets Center for a marines group that you can connect with. It's important to prioritize self-care and support in your busy schedule. To combat feeling isolated, try reaching out to friends or family and make time for activities you enjoy. If necessary, make a plan for visiting the Vets Center as soon as possible to help you stay accountable and follow through.
As a counsellor, I understand that you might feel uncomfortable showing vulnerability around your peers. However, it's important to connect with others and be a whole person, embracing your emotions as a part of your humanity. Instead of forcing yourself into crowded situations, maybe you could explore smaller, more intimate gatherings or support groups, where you can gradually learn to share your feelings and overcome loneliness.
I understand how difficult it can be to feel lonely, and it's important to work on ways to overcome that. One helpful approach could be to develop a plan for yourself to expand your social circle and foster connections with others. Think about activities or groups that align with your interests, which can create opportunities to meet new people. I'll check up on you after a certain period of time to see the progress you've made and discuss further adjustments if necessary. It's important not to stay in that lonely spot for too long.
It sounds like your first experience with anger came from observing your mom being angry. It must have been confusing for you as a child who didn't understand the situation. If you can remember, do you think that moment has influenced the way you express anger now in your life?
It sounds like you have some difficult memories from the past that are influencing your emotions in the present. Your experience with your mom might have left you with feelings of vulnerability and fear. It's important to recognize and process these feelings, so they don't continue to impact your present experiences and relationships. Can you think of any strategies to cope with these emotions when they arise?
It's insightful that you're recognizing a connection between your mother leaving and you walking out on your friends. This could be an important pattern for you to explore further. Can you tell me more about how this realization makes you feel or any impact it has on your thoughts or emotions?
Thank you for sharing your experience. It's understandable that you felt frustrated and angry when your boyfriend didn't communicate his feelings with you after bringing up the issue. It's great that you recognized the need to step away and calm down, despite still feeling angry afterward. Try to think of alternative ways to express your emotions and cope with your anger, such as deep breathing exercises, journaling, or even discussing your feelings with someone else. Also, consider discussing communication strategies with your boyfriend to avoid future misunderstandings and conflicts.
It's good to hear that you managed to smooth things over with the person you had an argument with, even though you didn't discuss the issue directly. In some cases, avoiding the anger-inducing topic can be a short-term solution, but it might be helpful to eventually address the issue calmly and openly to improve your relationship in the long run. If you feel comfortable, would you like to share more about the situation that caused the anger in the first place?
Understanding your triggers and finding constructive ways to deal with your anger is essential. In our counseling sessions, we can explore these triggers and work together to help you feel less helpless. One option might be discussing with your boyfriend about walking away when you feel too angry, as long as you have his permission and communication remains open. Our main focus will be on identifying the causes of your anger and developing healthier coping mechanisms.
It seems like one of your triggers for anger is when someone's unhappiness comes out of nowhere, leaving you confused and feeling like it's unfair. This may be a pattern that you've adopted from your childhood. Take some time to reflect on this pattern and consider how you can approach and handle these situations differently in the future, to prevent unnecessary frustration.
It seems like your boyfriend's shutting down is a big trigger for your feelings of helplessness. When he stops talking, it makes it hard for you to know how to help him and that can be very frustrating. Have you tried discussing this issue with him when he's in a more relaxed state, so you both can understand each other's needs better during such situations?
I noticed a change in your body language while you talked about the second email. It seems to have made you feel different. Can you tell me more about how it affected you and what emotions you were experiencing during that time?
It's understandable that you felt frustrated when your professor didn't reply to your email. However, instead of focusing on whether your feelings were right or wrong, let's discuss how you can be a better communicator. When feeling frustrated again in a similar situation, you can construct a polite follow-up email with a reminder about your previous message and a request for their response. This way, you can handle the situation more effectively and maintain a good relationship with your professor.
Thank you for sharing your experience. It sounds like you were frustrated with the lack of communication and sought a prompt response, which resulted in an unprofessional email. Considering your respect for the professor, it's natural to feel hurt by her feedback. However, it's important to acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes, and this could be a learning opportunity for you to improve your communication skills. How do you plan to address this situation moving forward?
It's understandable that you're feeling guilty and ashamed due to letting yourself get into that behavior again. What do you think led to you engaging in this behavior again and how can you learn from this situation to prevent it from happening in the future?
I understand that you're trying to improve your communication skills, and it's normal to have regrets about certain interactions. Since you feel comfortable with the initial email sent to your professor, let's focus on how you can handle situations like this in the future. What could you do differently next time when you don't receive a response as quickly as you'd like?
Based on our sessions, I can confirm that you indeed have made progress. It's normal to sometimes not be proud of the way you communicate, especially when responding without thinking. However, it's important to remember the skills you've learned and continue practicing them. Let's pick up our session next week and see how things go in the meantime.
As the counsellor, I simply replied, 'Okay.'
I understand that you're struggling with the balance between asserting yourself and not being too pushy. It sounds like you have a lot going on in your head while trying to write this email to your professor. One suggestion would be to acknowledge their busy schedule while still expressing your need for a response. You could say something like, 'I know you're busy, but I wanted to touch base with you again regarding the paper I sent earlier.' This should help convey your message politely without letting yourself feel walked over.
It's great to hear that you feel better after understanding your professor's busy schedule. It's important to remember that everyone has their own challenges and responsibilities. Your professor is likely doing her best to balance her workload and provide feedback on your paper as soon as she can. Try to be patient and continue focusing on your other tasks or assignments in the meantime. Would you like any advice or support on managing other aspects of your studies?
It's understandable to feel frustrated and maybe a little irritated when someone doesn't respond to you immediately. However, it's important not to let those feelings show up in your email communications. It seems that you're actually good at communicating through email when you put your mind to it. So, this could be an opportunity to improve your communication skills further by being more sensitive to others' response times.
It seems like you are trying to find a way to navigate this complex relationship with your father. One possible step towards forgiving and moving forward could be to send him a holiday card. Take some time to think about what kind of gift you'd be comfortable giving, and let's touch base in a week to see how you're feeling about the situation.
Instead of focusing on whether or not to send the holiday card, consider the idea of moving forward and regaining control over your feelings in this situation. Forgiving him doesn't mean you have to wish him well or forget the past, but rather it's about making a decision to put yourself in the driver's seat and not allowing him to have power over your emotions. You can still hold onto your wishes for an intact family, while accepting that things did not turn out that way.
It's understandable that you're feeling upset about the wedding invitation, considering the relationship you have with that person. However, it's important to focus on finding ways to let go of the resentment and move forward. One suggestion I have is to develop a small gesture of goodwill, like a note, card, or email, to send to them. Additionally, talking to your wife about your experiences with this person and your goal to let go of the resentment might be helpful in moving towards healing.
It seems that you have been experiencing lingering anger and awkwardness with your father for a while now, and it has even affected an important event like your wedding. I can imagine how difficult that must be for you. It's important to recognize that unresolved anger can have long-term effects on your mental health and relationships. Have you considered seeking methods to work through these feelings and explore potential resolution or acceptance, either by talking to a therapist or communicating with your father?
Sure, sure. I appreciate your doing this, and I understand that this is voluntary. I'd like you to consider making a direct decision to forgive the person causing your anger. Let go of the anger you're experiencing. At the very least, entertain the idea because right now, you just want to avoid dealing with them. Instead of putting them away, consider an alternate approach - moving forward with life. It doesn't mean they will be your best friend again, but find a place to integrate them into your life.
It sounds like you're struggling with your father's infidelity and its impact on your relationship. It's understandable to feel anger and disappointment about the situation. If you could speak freely with your father, what would you want to tell him? Addressing your feelings could be a step towards deciding whether you want to rebuild the relationship or continue keeping your distance.
It seems like this person or situation still has a strong emotional impact on you, especially since you find it difficult to maintain eye contact when discussing it. As a counsellor, I'm here to help you explore these feelings further. Can you tell me more about the specific aspects of the situation that continue to cause you pain?
It's important to acknowledge these feelings and work on the forgiveness process to move beyond being a victim of your father's behavior. Forgiving means disengaging the remembrance of what happened from the biophysical arousal. What happened has indeed happened, and the goal now is to disengage the unpleasant physical reactions from the memory and move on to the next chapter in your life without having this constant arousal. I understand this is difficult and a process that takes time, but think about your father's perspective, and try to understand why he had an affair and told you and your brother. This might help you work on forgiveness and slowly release that tension and arousal you're experiencing.
I understand that forgiving someone can be quite challenging, especially in your situation. However, forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting or condoning the behavior. It's more about allowing yourself to let go of the negative emotions and resentment towards your dad for his actions. This can ultimately help you move forward in life without being weighed down by the past. Think of forgiveness as a way to regain control over your emotions and find peace within yourself instead of focusing on what your dad did or didn't do.
I understand that you're feeling hurt and angry, and I'm not suggesting you should just ignore the situation or condone their behavior. What I'm asking you to consider is making a decision to forgive them, not because what they did was right, but for your own well-being and moving forward from this experience. Can you tell me what forgiveness means to you and how you might approach that process?
It is understandable that you may be struggling with anger and feeling like a victim. The key to moving forward is to find a way to resolve the relationship without necessarily condoning or forgetting what happened. You don't have to invite this person to significant events in your life, but putting the relationship in a different framework can help you feel less like a victim. One way to do this is by giving a gift, as it could show that you are taking control of your emotions and moving on. How do you think this approach might change your perspective on the situation?
It sounds like you're finding it challenging to give gifts despite having a positive experience in the past. It might be helpful to explore why it has become difficult for you now. Are there specific factors or situations that have contributed to this change in your feelings about gift-giving?
It's understandable that it's difficult for you to accept and deal with your father's actions. Regardless of the cause, his actions have affected you deeply. It's important for you to acknowledge and process your feelings of anger. Can you share more about the outcomes of how his actions have influenced you, whether it was intentional or not?
It's interesting that you've observed this pattern happening around the same time each year. Have you considered any external factors or personal experiences that might be influencing this change in behavior? Reflecting on those potential factors may provide some insight and help you understand why this pattern occurs.
You've already identified an important factor, which is that when you're doing well, it's easier to convince yourself that you can handle things now. However, relying solely on negative consequences as motivation can make it easy to fall into the trap of setbacks. It's crucial to find other sources of motivation to maintain progress.
It's essential that you recognize the importance of being positively motivated for personal growth, instead of merely avoiding problematic situations. To achieve this, it's valuable to identify and work on your values, strengths, and passions. One question you can reflect upon is what are some positive goals you'd like to focus on to improve your life?
I appreciate your honesty and recognition of your alcoholism. It's important to take responsibility for our actions and prioritize our well-being. Have you considered attending support groups like AA to help you on your journey towards recovery? Their structured environment and community support might be helpful in preventing future incidents.
It's understandable that you feel worried about confronting your past experiences, especially if they are related to your long history of drinking. It can be overwhelming to discuss these issues, but remember that as your counsellor, I'm here to support and help you navigate through those memories. It's crucial for your healing process to address these concerns. Can you please share one of those scary incidences that you're comfortable talking about?
It sounds like the pressure of being questioned by the sponsor made you feel uneasy, but knowing that we might not meet again provides some relief. It's completely normal to feel intimidated in certain situations, and it's important to recognize and acknowledge your feelings. If you find yourself in a similar position in the future, try taking deep breaths and reminding yourself that it's okay to be nervous. You can also practice answering some potential questions beforehand to build your confidence.
It's normal to feel anxious when you're being questioned by someone you know, especially if you're feeling stuck and uncertain of their reaction. It's essential to remember that everyone has their own experiences, and sometimes, misunderstandings may occur. Take a deep breath, relax, and try to communicate clearly so that the person can understand your perspective. Given this situation, do you think it's the environment or the person you're going to talk to that worries you more?
Yes, a temporary sponsor is someone you can call and talk to about your recovery process. They may not be a long-term support, but they can still provide guidance and help you stay accountable. It's important to find a permanent sponsor eventually, as they can develop a deeper understanding of your challenges and support you more effectively.
It sounds like you might be dealing with a lack of motivation and possibly struggling with your relationship with alcohol. It's important to recognize that these feelings might be an indication of a deeper issue, like depression or stress. Have you considered seeking professional help or talking to your wife about your struggles? It may help you to regain your passion and better manage your emotions.
It’s great that you have positive experiences with the 12 Step programs in the past. Since you are feeling stuck and enjoyed the socializing and interactions from those programs, I would suggest considering rejoining a 12 Step program or finding a similar support group to regain that sense of connection and accountability. Additionally, it could be helpful to explore other activities or groups that also allow for meaningful social interactions and support personal growth.
I understand that you appreciate the social aspect of the meetings, but feel overwhelmed by the physical expressions of affection. It's important to set boundaries that make you comfortable. You can politely decline hugs or suggest alternatives, like a handshake. If the situation becomes more challenging, consider discussing it with the group facilitator or others who may feel the same way.
I understand your preference for handshakes over hugs and it's important to set boundaries that are comfortable for you. You could try to initiate a handshake first when meeting someone, allowing you to politely establish the physical interaction you prefer. If you're still worried about communicating your preference, try to practice expressing your feelings with someone you trust, it might help you gain confidence in sharing your personal boundaries.
It's positive to hear that you enjoyed the 12 Step program during your time in rehab. It seems that your family and friends are concerned about your drinking habits. Could you share more about your experiences with drinking since leaving the Marine Corps and how it has impacted your life? This will help us explore potential next steps for support.
It sounds like you've been facing a plateau in your recovery process around the one-year mark. It's important to be aware of potential triggers and ensure you're receiving the support you need during this time. Can you identify any specific challenges or situations that have contributed to this pattern?
Congratulations on being sober for a year; that's a significant accomplishment! It's good to know that you have limited experience with other drugs like marijuana and none with cocaine. Keep focusing on maintaining your sobriety and finding healthy ways to cope with life's challenges. If you ever feel tempted to use substances again, don't hesitate to reach out for support.
It's great to hear that you have been clean for a year, and that is a significant achievement. Different approaches work for different people in their recovery, and it's important that you find what works best for you. If you ever find yourself struggling, consider exploring other recovery programs or support groups to further strengthen your sobriety.
It's great to hear that you're experiencing positive improvements and are now functioning better in your life. It's also encouraging that the program has been beneficial in your previous experiene. Keep focusing on your progress and remember to reach out if you need any support or guidance.
As a counsellor, I understand your concern about finding the right balance between comfort and effectiveness in a sponsor. It is vital to establish trust and respect, but having someone who challenges you when needed can be beneficial. Have you considered talking to multiple people in the support group to find someone who fits both criteria?
It's great that you recognize the need for honesty and openness in a friendship. Remember, it's important to find a balance between being truthful and maintaining a healthy relationship. It might help to communicate your concerns with your friend and create an environment where both of you can be honest with each other.
It's important to take your time in finding the right sponsor. A good sponsor should be supportive, understanding, and non-judgmental. As you attend meetings, try to connect with people who you feel comfortable with and who share similar experiences or values. Don't be afraid to ask someone if they would be willing to be your temporary or long-term sponsor. What kind of qualities are you looking for in a sponsor?
It's great that you are being mindful of your communication style while working with the 12 Steps program. You can try expressing your needs by saying something like, 'I really appreciate honest feedback, but I find it most helpful when it's delivered in a gentle and supportive way. Can you please share your thoughts with me in that manner?' This way, you are setting clear expectations for the type of communication you prefer while also indicating that you value others' opinions.
It's normal to have thoughts and opinions about situations, especially if they involve close friends or loved ones. It's important to recognize and acknowledge these feelings, as they can help us better understand our own values and boundaries. Being judgmental is a natural part of being human, but we can work on being more self-aware and understanding. Have you noticed any patterns or specific situations that trigger these judgmental thoughts?
It seems like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed and unsure about what kind of support you need. It's okay to feel that way. It's important to consider what aspects of your situation you'd like help with, and what kind of qualities you're looking for in a sponsor. Think about what has worked for you in the past or what might be helpful for you now. Remember it's a process to find the right person, and don't hesitate to reach out to others for guidance.
It's completely normal to feel uncertain about what to expect in a counseling session, especially if you're new to it. As your counsellor, my role is to help you identify and address any issues that you're facing. To begin, can you share any experiences or feelings that have been bothering you lately?
It's good that you acknowledge your issues and are considering seeking help through 12 Step programs. Let's discuss any obstacles you might have experienced in the past with these programs, and explore other ways you can effectively work through your problems. We can talk about anything else that comes up in our conversation as well.
Thank you for sharing your background and experiences with alcohol. It sounds like you've been dealing with this issue for a while and it has impacted your life choices. Let's discuss what steps you have taken, if any, to address your alcoholism, and explore together the changes and support that could help you overcome this challenge.
It's great that you're recognizing the need to stay busy and find activities to fill your time instead of turning to drinking. Hobbies are a fantastic way to combat boredom and keep your mind occupied. Have you considered joining any social groups or clubs related to your interests, such as landscaping, which could provide additional support and a sense of community?
It's great that you have a supportive family. The idea behind attending 90 meetings in 90 days is to build momentum in your recovery journey. Daily meetings help you establish a strong routine and support network, which is crucial during the early stages of recovery. By consistently attending meetings, you can gain insights and coping strategies from others who have faced similar challenges, which can help you in maintaining your sobriety.
It's great that you have a supportive family, and acknowledging your excuses is an important step. It's okay to feel overwhelmed with the idea of attending meetings. One suggestion could be to look at different options for childcare or alternate meeting times so that you can balance your commitments. Remember, you have the power to take control of your situation, and taking small steps can lead to significant progress.
It's great to hear that you made a positive choice by not drinking today. However, it's important to find long-term strategies to address your relationship with alcohol. Was coming here for support part of your plan to help yourself?
It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed after returning from a high-stress mission. It can take time to process everything you've experienced, especially when you were focused on your tasks during the mission. It might be helpful to talk through your thoughts and emotions with someone you trust, or consider seeking professional help if you feel like it's affecting your well-being. Remember, it's important to give yourself time to heal and adjust to your daily life again.
It sounds like you're still struggling with the impact of that past traumatic experience, which is affecting your motivation in life. It's important to recognize and accept these feelings, and perhaps explore some ways of coping, such as speaking with a therapist or seeking support from a group. Can you elaborate on how this event may be influencing your daily life or other specific aspects?
It seems like you have a pattern of putting things off until there's a sense of urgency or an external factor forcing you to take action. Procrastination can be quite common, but recognizing it is the first step to overcoming it. Try breaking tasks into smaller ones and set deadlines for yourself. You can also seek support from friends or family members to help you stay accountable. If you continue to struggle with procrastination, you might want to consider seeking professional help to explore any underlying issues.
I'm sorry to hear about your recent car accident and the damage to your ear.

It seems like the issue here might be more about the way you both communicate. Since your partner wasn't listening to your explanation and you felt unheard, it's important to address this communication pattern. Can you think of any strategies you've used in the past to improve your communication with him?
It seems like there was a miscommunication between you and the other person, which led to him getting upset. To avoid such situations in the future, you can try to ensure that both of you are on the same page by double checking if the other person heard and understood what you said, or maybe by utilizing written communication like text messages or notes. Were there any other contributing factors that might have made him react so strongly in this situation?
Now that you've observed this pattern, which of these two interpretations of your situation seems more accurate: Is it solely due to work-related factors, or is there something else in your life that might be contributing to your emotional state? Considering the latter could help identify the root cause and guide us toward an effective solution.
It's important to understand that everyone is responsible for their own emotions and reactions. While it's good to be aware of how your actions may affect others, it's not your responsibility to manage Bryan's feelings. Why do you think it's your fault when he gets mad?
As a counsellor, it's important to recognize that believing everything is your fault can lead to negative feelings about yourself. Instead, try to reflect on whether you're actually responsible for the situation or if there are other factors involved. You can also ask yourself what evidence supports the belief that it's your fault and if there's any evidence against it. This way, you can develop a more balanced perspective and work on improving how you feel about yourself.
It seems that when you believe you're at fault, it creates a lot of anxiety and self-doubt, causing you to constantly question and adjust your actions. This could be quite exhausting and may not necessarily lead to better outcomes. Try focusing on open communication with Bryan to understand his expectations, rather than assuming what he wants. This could help in alleviating your anxiety and enable you to make decisions with more confidence. If you continue to experience anxiety and self-doubt, consider seeking additional support from a therapist or counselor.
As a counsellor, I understand that it can be difficult when you feel responsible for your partner's emotions. However, it is essential to remember that each person has control over their own feelings and reactions. Instead of blaming yourself, try to work together with your partner to understand the root causes of the issues and focus on improving communication. Would you like to share an example of a situation that led you to believe it's your fault?
It sounds like you were being perceptive and attentive to your friend's reactions. It can be difficult to predict someone's feelings later on, but if he gave you verbal and non-verbal indications that he was okay with your decision, you made a reasonable choice based on the information available. Just remember, communication is key and checking in with your friend later would be a good way to ensure there are no unresolved feelings on either side.
It's important to closely examine the evidence that supports your belief that you're to blame and also consider any evidence that might challenge that belief. Relationships involve two people, and it's not fair to put all the blame on one person. Can you clarify any specific issues or incidents that make you feel responsible?
It's not fair to put the blame entirely on yourself. Relationships involve two people, and communication and understanding are important for resolving conflicts. While it's possible that your actions might contribute to the issues, it's also crucial to consider your partner's role and reactions in the situation. Have you tried discussing these problems with your partner to understand their perspective and work together towards a solution?
It's important to remember that in any relationship, both parties contribute to the dynamics, and it's not fair for one person to carry all the blame. Try to reflect on specific instances where you felt blamed and consider if there were external factors or mutual misunderstandings involved. It's a healthy practice to communicate openly with Bryan about your feelings and thoughts, and possibly even encourage a joint effort to resolve conflicts in a more balanced manner. Remember, you both have an equal responsibility to make the relationship work.
It sounds like you're feeling guilty for not recognizing your partner's needs, even though he gave you permission to go out with your friends. It can be difficult to pick up on subtle cues when communication isn't clear. In the future, try having open conversations about your plans and each other's expectations to avoid misunderstandings. What do you think could help improve your communication with your partner?
I think there might be an error in your thinking there. It seems like if he's clearly saying it's okay for you to go out with your friends, you shouldn't have to secretly know that there is some secret signal. What makes you think that you should've known and that there was a signal?
It seems that you are dealing with a complex situation regarding your partner's emotions and your social life. It's good that he agreed for you to go out this time, but it's important to address his concerns as well. Have you tried talking to him about why he gets upset when you go out with your friends and how you both can work towards a resolution?
It sounds like you were focused on the overt communication between you and the other person, and that's completely understandable. I believe it would be an error to think that you should've known something was wrong. Sometimes, we can't foresee issues that may arise in relationships. Don't be too hard on yourself, as you were simply going along with the existing communication.
It's important to recognize that communication issues can be a shared burden in a relationship. It might be helpful to discuss these problems together and consider working on improving communication skills to reduce conflicts. Remember, it's essential to approach this as a team effort and support each other throughout the process.
It's great to see that you're recognizing the shared responsibility in a relationship and acknowledging that both parties need to work on their communication skills. Let's analyze the situation further to identify any patterns or triggers that lead to conflict, and then discuss ways in which both of you can improve your communication for a healthier relationship. Can you provide an example of when a communication issue led to a fight?
It seems like the conflicts in your relationship might be stemming from some mistakes or miscommunications, as you mentioned in the instance of coming home late. To improve the situation, it's important to be aware of the reasons for these conflicts and to communicate better if you find yourself in similar situations. Can you identify any other patterns or specific issues that led to the other fights in this past week?
It sounds like you and your partner are struggling with resolving conflicts, especially since you had two fights back-to-back about the same situation. Can you tell me more about what specifically caused both fights and how they were similar or different from each other?
It seems like you are noticing a pattern in your relationship, where there is a period of calm after a big fight. This can be a common dynamic in relationships, called the 'honeymoon phase.' It's important to reflect on whether this pattern is healthy or if there are underlying issues that need to be addressed. Can you think of any unresolved topics or recurring disagreements that might be contributing to this cycle?
It's interesting because the psychological research about abusive relationships has identified a pretty common pattern, where after a big fight, both people often feel bad, apologize and then they're both on their best behavior. This can be a concerning pattern in a relationship, as it may lead to a cycle of abuse and reconciliation. It's essential to address the underlying issues causing the conflicts and seek professional help if necessary.
It's common for couples to experience a 'honeymoon phase' after a big argument when everything seems to be going well. However, it's important not to overlook underlying issues during this time. Even though things seem fine, it's necessary to address and resolve ongoing issues to prevent future conflicts. I'd recommend attending couple's counseling sessions to address these issues effectively and promote lasting change in your relationship.
I am glad to hear about your progress, and it's important to acknowledge the positive changes you have made. However, let's address the concerns that are still troubling you. Can you please elaborate on the specific issues that you're still struggling with so we can discuss possible solutions together?
It's great to hear that you've made progress in your personal growth. However, not everyone is ready to change at the same pace. As much as we would like to help and support our friends, it's essential to respect their boundaries and decisions. It's good that you invited Bryan to seek help, but ultimately, it's up to him to make that choice. Is there something specific about Bryan's situation that concerns you?
It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and trapped in your current situation. It's important to communicate your feelings to your partner and express how his behavior is affecting you. Perhaps seeking couple's therapy could help to better understand each other's perspectives and find a resolution. If you still find yourself feeling unhappy, remember it's crucial to prioritize your mental and emotional wellbeing.
It's understandable that you're feeling scared and uncertain about your partner's reaction. You've come to the conclusion that if he is not able to change his part of the pattern the way you have, you may not be able to stay in that relationship. This is indeed a difficult decision you're facing. Have you considered finding a safe time and place to have this conversation with your partner, or having someone you trust present for support?
It seems like your friends are providing you with some perspective, indicating that it may not be your fault. It's important to consider their opinions, as well as your own experiences where you couldn't identify what made your friend angry. It might be more about your friend's mood or personal issues, rather than something you did. Can you think of any other examples where you tried your best, and your friend's anger seemed unreasonable or unrelated to your actions?
It seems like you're experiencing mixed feedback from your friends regarding your role in the conflicts. It's important to recognize that sometimes conflicts can arise even when we feel we're doing everything right. In your case, Bryan's anger might not always be a result of your actions. Try to reflect on the situations, taking into consideration both perspectives, and identify any areas where you can improve your communication or behavior.
It's great that you are reconsidering your beliefs. Since the evidence is not clearly supporting your previous belief that you are mostly to blame, have you considered alternative explanations? For example, poor communication may be playing a role in your relationship conflicts.
As a counsellor, I want to reassure you that it is definitely possible for transgender women to find love and be in meaningful relationships. It might be encouraging for you to hear that I've seen several transgender women entering relationships. Keep looking, and don't lose hope.
As a counsellor, I understand it can be difficult and painful to face mistreatment as a transgender woman. It's unfortunately a common experience, but I want to instill hope and validate your feelings. It's great to hear that you've found bars in New York that host transgender parties and meet & greet events, as they can provide a supportive community where you can feel more comfortable and meet others with similar experiences. Please don't hesitate to share any concerns or observations about these events.
It's great that you're socializing and meeting new people. It can be helpful to clarify your intentions when interacting with others, especially in environments where there might be misunderstandings. Keep being true to yourself and enjoy the fun and connections at such events. If you ever feel uncomfortable or have concerns about discussing your identity or intentions, feel free to share those thoughts with me.
It's completely understandable that stigma can be triggering and make it harder to express yourself fully. I think it's great that you want to be an advocate and show the talents of transgender people. One question I have for you is: what steps are you currently taking to work on being an advocate and showcasing your talents?
I understand that losing your business can be a difficult experience, especially when dealing with gender issues and people treating you poorly. It's important to not let these people define your worth. Remember, you have the power to rise above the negativity and continue to pursue your passions. If you don't mind answering, what are some of the coping strategies you have tried so far to deal with your depression?
As a counsellor, I can see how this situation can be frustrating for you. To better empathize with your employee, try actively listening to their concerns and take time to reflect on their perspective. It's important to foster an open and trusting environment where they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts. If needed, you can also encourage them to express their ideas more clearly. Is there a specific issue you're having a hard time understanding?
It's important to have supportive friends, especially during a transition like this. I understand it can be difficult when they don't acknowledge your new name. Instead of joking, try having a serious conversation with them about the importance of using your chosen name, and how their behavior is affecting you. If they continue to not respond, you may want to evaluate your relationships and consider finding more supportive friends.
I'm glad to hear that you have developed coping strategies to deal with people calling you by your birth name. It shows great resilience. As you mentioned that the issue is mostly related to your job, could you please share more details about how it is specifically affecting your work environment or relationships with coworkers?
It sounds like you've faced challenges in maintaining your privacy and dealing with insensitive remarks at work. It's important to remember that it's your right to decide who you share your gender identity with and establish boundaries. You may consider talking to your manager or HR about these incidents to create a more inclusive and supportive work environment. Do you have any specific examples of the types of comments being made that you'd like support in addressing?
I understand that the constant questioning can be both validating and concerning at the same time. It's great that your friends are supportive and find you passable. However, it's essential not to rely solely on external validation. Focus on building confidence in yourself and try not to let the opinions of others affect you too much. If you find the situation bothersome, would you consider addressing it with your coworkers or discussing it with a supervisor?
I understand that this discrepancy in your documents can be quite stressful, especially during important situations like interviews. To address this concern, I would suggest getting your documents corrected at the earliest by contacting the relevant authority or institution. This will help you prevent any further problems or confusion arising from the incorrect gender information.
Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you've gone through significant changes in the past four years. Let's explore how these transformations have impacted your career, love life, and other experiences in more detail. Can you tell me more about what led to this transformation and how it affects these areas of your life?
I understand that it's important for you to feel validated by your family, especially with regards to your name. It can be helpful for you to try and communicate your feelings to them. Have you discussed this issue with your family and expressed your desire to be referred to by your preferred name?
I understand how challenging it can be when your birth name and gender do not align with your true identity. It's important to remember that you have the right to define yourself and explore your identity. Have you considered changing your name or seeking support from a gender therapist to help you navigate through these feelings?
It's great that you have a positive outlook towards the situation and that your mother's encouragement motivates you to excel and not be bothered by your birth name. Just remember that it is your actions and character that define who you are, and not the name you are called. If you ever feel affected by this issue in the future, feel free to reach out to discuss those feelings.
As a counsellor, I would say that it's important to recognize that everyone comes from different backgrounds and holds different beliefs. It's admirable that you acknowledge and respect their perspective. You can try to find common ground, and engage in open, respectful conversations with them regarding any misunderstandings. Remember, developing mutual understanding may take time, so be patient and continue to express love and support for your family.
Thank you for sharing your concern. Since this is a minor error, you can simply inform the HR or the person responsible for the hiring process about the mistake and request to update the correct information. It's important to address this misunderstanding as soon as possible to avoid potential complications. Don't worry too much, as this is a common mistake and employers understand that people can make mistakes on forms.
It sounds like the situation with human resources might have been a bit uncomfortable for you. It's important to remember that your gender identity is valid, regardless of what others may think or say. If you are concerned about their reaction or would like more support, would you like to discuss options for addressing this with them or finding resources within the company?
It seems like you might be feeling a bit worried or anxious about the situation. It's natural to feel that way when others are discussing us without our presence. However, since it involves a background check, it could be a standard procedure for your job and nothing to be overly concerned about. Can you share more about how this situation is affecting you?
It's completely understandable that you might be feeling skeptical about the situation, especially because of the uncertainty around the scheduling. I suggest giving it some time and waiting for their call. However, if you're still concerned about the situation or don't hear back from them soon, feel free to reach out to them for an update. Remember, it's okay to ask questions and seek clarity.
It's great to see that you've recognized the opportunities that came your way and made a decision to start your own business. Pursuing your passion and creating your own path can be very rewarding. What kind of support or guidance do you need to turn this dream into reality? I'm here to help you.
It's great to hear that you are content with who you are and embrace your uniqueness. Remember that it's essential to stay true to yourself and what makes you happy. If you ever feel the need for change, it should come from within and not because of external pressures. Is there any specific reason you shared this with him?
I can understand how that can be an additional stressor for you. It's unfortunate that we still have systems in place that don't fully recognize the diverse gender identities people have. Remember that your identity is valid, and it's important to advocate for more inclusive policies. Is there any specific instance that recently caused this concern?
You absolutely have the right to decide what personal information you want to share with others, including your sexual preferences. It's unfortunate that transgender individuals often face overly intrusive questions, and you should feel free to refuse answering if you are uncomfortable. Remember, setting boundaries is important for protecting your emotional wellbeing.
It sounds like you've been doing well coping with certain aspects of life and working to stay positive. To address your concern about possible depression tied to your business loss, let's explore what contributed to your depression previously, so we can identify strategies to prevent it from happening again. Are there specific triggers or circumstances that led to your depression back then?
Thank you for sharing your experiences. It's good to see that you've found a way to handle some of the difficulties, but it's important to recognize that passing as a transgender person may bring its own set of challenges. It might be beneficial for you to explore various coping strategies or consider joining a support group to help you navigate your unique journey.
Thank you for sharing your experience. It can be tough dealing with obstacles and documentation issues, but it's important to remember that these challenges don't define us. Try to find support from others who may have experienced similar situations, and don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.
It sounds like changing your name has been an important part of your journey, and it has helped you avoid some challenges while traveling abroad. It can be frustrating to have your identity questioned while traveling. If you are still facing any challenges related to your identity or name change, please feel free to share those concerns.
It's understandable that you might be concerned about potential issues while traveling abroad after changing your gender legally. It's important to weigh the pros and cons of this decision. What specific issues are you worried about when traveling with an updated gender marker?
I understand your concerns about changing your gender and the potential for medical scans to still show your original genitals. It's important to note that gender-affirming surgeries are designed to align your body with your true identity, but it's natural to have questions and anxieties about the process. If you have concerns about specific medical procedures or complications, I encourage you to speak with your healthcare provider so you can make the best decision for yourself.
Mm-hmm, and it, and even though it's hard there's a little flicker of power in that, like, 'I've got a right to feel crappy if (ph)duth (ph)else.' 'And I can go back and look at what got me to feeling this way.', which then says, 'What do I begin to work to change either individually or collectively with other people to get this (ph)heavidess off of me?' And some of the heaviness may be a foot that someone is holding you down. So it's not all internal. Th- . . . It might catch the internal pleas but we gotta talk about what is sitting on top of you too.
It's great to have a strong spiritual community for support during this difficult time. Please feel free to share about your spiritual practice and how it could be of assistance as you move through this heaviness. Your hesitance is understood, but know that this space is open for you to discuss your spiritual beliefs and how they can help you in your healing process.
Mm-kay. Could you please elaborate on the situation you're facing and why it's causing you worry or distress? Understanding the unique aspects of your experience can help me provide better support and guidance.
I noticed your energy shift as you talked about your aspirations to do workshops, and then you mentioned feeling fear. What do you think is stopping you from pursuing your goals and causing this fear?
It's important to recognize the difference between feeling depressed or sad and feeling fearful, as they can sometimes be intertwined. Keep in mind that fear can lead to sadness and vice versa. You might want to consider identifying moments when fear is present in your life and try not to let it dictate your actions. By noticing these moments and addressing them, you can better manage your emotions and reduce the confusion between sadness and fear.
It's important to dream big and reconnect with your passions. Rather than focusing on where you are right now, think about your ultimate goal or dream and figure out step-by-step how you can achieve it. Consider attending workshops or group sessions that can help you process your emotions and rediscover your dreams. Remember that many people go through this experience, and it's possible to move forward and reclaim your dreams.
It's great to hear that you're able to visualize a positive future for yourself. This can be an effective step in overcoming challenges and achieving your goals. If you have any concerns or would like guidance on how to maintain this positive mindset, please feel free to share.
It's understandable that suppressing emotions can be challenging and add more weight to how you feel. As a counsellor, I would like to explore healthy ways for you to express your anger and find a balance, so that you don't have to bottle up your feelings. In your experience, have you found any strategies that have helped you manage your emotions?
I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed and suppressed. It seems like you're not allowed to express your emotions freely, which might be contributing to a sense of numbness and possibly even depression. As a counsellor, I would suggest that we work together on reclaiming your emotions and opening up those feelings, allowing you to experience and express them in a healthy way without judgment. This process may be challenging, but it can lead to personal growth and a better understanding of yourself.
It sounds like you're experiencing a significant change in your energy levels and it's affecting your ability to function normally. It's important to acknowledge that you're facing this challenge, and I'm glad you've shared this with me. Can you think of any specific events or changes in your life that might have triggered this feeling of heaviness?
It's commendable that you have been able to push through for a year, but it seems like this situation is catching up with you. It's important to reflect on when you first noticed this and identify any factors at work or in your personal life that may be contributing to this stress. This can help us better understand and address the problem.
I understand that being a black woman in a professional setting can be challenging due to societal expectations and pressures. It's normal to feel the need to do well and prove your worth. However, it's essential to remember that you deserve to be in your position and deserve respect from your colleagues. Try to focus on your strengths and abilities rather than constantly monitoring yourself. If you find this sensation overwhelming, you may want to consider talking to your co-workers about your feelings or seeking professional help to overcome these barriers.
As a counsellor, I understand that constantly giving 150% can be exhausting. It's essential to recognize your own limits and take breaks when needed. It's healthy to strive for personal growth and achievements, but remember to also prioritize self-care and balance in your life. Can you share some specific situations where you feel the need to give 150%?
I notice that your energy seems low. Can you tell me more about what happened at work today that has been affecting you?
We talked before about the importance of naming things to be able to change them. What you described - sadness, lack of energy, and negative thoughts - might be called depression. However, it seems like you don't resonate with that label. Could you share more about how you feel regarding this label?
It's important to recognize and understand the nature of this heaviness you're experiencing. Can you tell me more about what it feels like and how it affects your daily life?
It's important to recognize that your feelings of hopelessness and heaviness may be amplified due to your need to constantly be on guard. This can be a result of the multiple levels of oppression you're experiencing. In order to cope, we need to discuss these various areas of oppression and how they affect you, as well as explore strategies for managing your emotions and energy levels in a healthier manner.
It sounds like you are experiencing an uncomfortable and unfair work environment, where you feel singled out due to your race. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and consider discussing your concerns with your supervisor or HR department. They should be able to address any biases and work towards creating a fair, inclusive, and supportive work environment for everyone. If it becomes too much to bear, it may be beneficial to seek other employment options where you feel valued and respected.
It's understandable that you feel exhausted from constantly being watched and expected not to make mistakes. It's important to recognize the added burden of dealing with the racial component. Remember that it's okay to seek support and acknowledge the heaviness you're experiencing. It might be helpful to find coping strategies, like talking to trusted friends or seeking professional help, to manage the pressure and take care of your mental well-being. Have you ever tried seeking support from a therapist or support group?
I understand that it's difficult to face these thoughts and feelings, and no one wants to feel like they're struggling with mental health. However, it's important to recognize that there might be external factors contributing to your reactions and emotions. Understanding this can help you find ways to cope and feel better.
I understand that you're feeling isolated in your struggle, but please know that it's not just you. Many people face similar situations, and it's important to connect with others who share your experiences. You are not alone, and we can work together to find ways to cope with your feelings and the situation.
I understand that you're going through a challenging journey like Alice in Wonderland. It's important to remember that it's okay to acknowledge your emotions and give yourself the space to cry or process what you're experiencing. You don't always need to have everything figured out. Allow yourself some time for self-care and find support in people who understand and value your true self.
It's understandable that you're feeling tired and judged. It's important that you allow yourself the space to feel sad and tired when needed. Remember, historically, black women are not lazy, and understanding this history can help you in claiming your right to take care of yourself without judgement. Is there something specific that has happened recently that makes you feel judged?
I understand that you want to get back to enjoying your life, especially by practicing spirituality with your friends and community, as well as doing more of the energy work you love. Can you describe what aspects of your current situation are preventing you from enjoying your life and doing these activities?
It sounds like you recognize the importance of energy healing not only for others but also for yourself. As a counsellor, I suggest you start incorporating more of your spiritual practices and energy work in your daily life. This will not only help you heal yourself but also strengthen your ability to fulfill your dream of becoming a healer. Remember, it's okay to be a wounded healer – the experience of going through your own healing process can make you an even more empathetic and effective healer for others.
It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed in your current situation, but it's important to remember that healing is possible. The fact that you're dreaming big and considering becoming a motivational speaker is a positive step towards working through your challenges. Your experiences can offer valuable insights and inspire others. Keep nurturing that dream, and remember, it's okay to reach for your goals even when things may seem difficult.
As a counsellor, I appreciate you sharing your beliefs with me. It's important to recognize and honor your traditions in this work, especially since they make you feel good. I noticed that you brightened up as you talked about your spirituality. In your everyday life, can you think of any rituals, gatherings, or practices related to your beliefs that you could use to help lift the heaviness you've been feeling?
Mm-hmm. Absolutely. It's something. If you're very used to having rituals, you could also create a ritual around your coming out of this descent and just think about that, you know? Like, what's a way that you could find anchors to bring you out of this and if you've got tools that work for you, we definitely want to use them. How about focusing on setting some positive goals in terms of hopes and dreams? That way, we can work together on how to achieve them in your life.
I understand that you're going through a difficult time, but I'd like to introduce the concept of the descent in the hero's journey, where one gets down to a low point before finding the strength to rise again. This heavy sadness you're feeling might be a part of your own journey, where you'll eventually find something about yourself and grow from this experience. It's a process, and I believe you'll be able to overcome it.
I like to use the rabbit hole analogy because it presents a more hopeful perspective. It's not just about feeling broken, but rather, it's about undergoing a transformation. As we discussed earlier, this can apply to situations at work, where you might experience oppression and internal sadness. The important thing is to focus on the potential for growth and transformation from those experiences.
It's important to remember that you are the expert on yourself and how you feel. The fear you're experiencing might be trying to get in the way of your hopes and dreams. As a homework assignment, I want you to write down all your big dreams. During our next session, we'll talk about how to make them happen. Trust in your ability to overcome this fear and work towards your goals.
It's great that you are aware of your need for support, and recognizing it is a crucial first step. While your work schedule may be different from others, you can still find ways to connect with colleagues and build relationships. As you settle into your new role, you will naturally find opportunities to interact with others and receive support. Focus on your responsibilities as a counselor, and remain open to building connections when the chance arises.
It's natural to feel some anxiety when stepping into the unknown and adjusting to new communication methods. Consider trying different options like emails, online messaging, or video calls to see which one or a combination works best for you. Remember, as you spend more time connecting with others in Alaska, you'll likely grow more comfortable and confident. Is there any particular concern that makes communication with the staff more challenging?
It seems like revisiting that chapter and reaching out to others for advice have previously been useful for you. Re-reading the chapter might give you additional insights, and talking to people with experience in Alaska could provide valuable tips. Committing to these actions could help you navigate through your concerns better. Is there anything else you think might be helpful?
I appreciate you sharing your concerns and recognizing your need for guidance. It's a good idea to ask for that support, as having a dedicated go-to person can help alleviate stress and provide you with the structure you might be seeking in navigating through your challenges. So, go ahead and reach out for that support, and we will continue working together to address your concerns in our upcoming sessions. Thank you.
It seems like you're dealing with mixed feelings about this upcoming venture and the potential impact on your relationships. I wonder if there's any activity or assignment you could do in the next week to help you process these emotions and prepare yourself for the change, before our next session? I can provide some suggestions if needed.
As a counsellor, I acknowledge your strong bond with your nieces and nephews and the important role you play in their lives. It's natural to feel concerned for their well-being, but it's essential to recognize that providing love and support is the most crucial aspect. If you have any specific incidents or experiences that might have triggered this guilt, I'd be interested to learn more, so I can better understand and guide you through these emotions.
It's completely understandable to feel scared and concerned about the unknown, especially when changing environments and being responsible for others. It's important to remember that building relationships and support networks takes time, and as people have told you, the new environment is supportive and understanding. Perhaps focus on what you can proactively do to build connections and continue your personal growth. How do you usually handle new situations or adjust to unfamiliar environments?
Thank you for sharing your past experiences. I appreciate your feedback and will strive to avoid giving advice, as it doesn't align with my approach to counseling. We will work together as partners to help you uncover the choices, changes, or coping strategies that are important for you. Please feel free to provide feedback on what you find helpful or unhelpful throughout our sessions.
I understand that this situation feels different and can be a bit overwhelming for you. It's an adjustment for both of us, but I believe we can settle into this together. I'd like to remind you of the ground rules we've established, the tissues available, and the professional disclosure statement for your reference. Also, I want to reiterate the limits of confidentiality mentioned in the informed consent document you signed. Is there any part of the process or environment that is particularly bothering you?
As a counsellor, I appreciate your understanding of the confidentiality exceptions. It is essential for both of us to be aware of these circumstances to maintain a safe and productive counselling environment. If you have any concerns, feel free to ask and I will clarify them for you. Our main goal is to work together in addressing your needs while respecting the ethical boundaries of our profession.
It sounds like you are going through a significant change in your life, and it's understandable that you may have concerns about losing the close relationships you have with your family, especially your niece and nephew. It might help to think about ways you can maintain and strengthen those relationships despite the distance. You could consider scheduling regular video calls, writing letters, and planning visits when possible. Remember, relationships can evolve over time and distance, and it's possible to maintain a strong bond with your loved ones even when you're far apart.
It's natural to feel guilty about making decisions that impact your relationships, especially if you think you've built expectations. It's important to remember that people can understand and adapt to changes. Communicating your feelings and intentions can help your loved ones see your perspective. You still care for them, and that's something they need to know. Consider having an open conversation with them about your decision and their feelings.
It's evident that you deeply treasure your relationship with Alison and Joshua and have put a lot of thought and energy into being a significant figure in their lives.

It seems that you're concerned about building personal and professional supports, and that you feel you've wasted time worrying instead of growing.

To address these concerns, try to utilize your alone time for self-discovery and seek additional support to help improve your situation. Remember, it's never too late to identify your strengths and pursue a path that aligns with your interests.
I'm glad that discussing your concerns has been helpful. It's normal to experience a mix of excitement and worry when planning something new.

I can understand your concern about bringing past fears into your new job. It seems like you're taking the negative experience from your previous work and applying it to the new situation, when it might be different. It's important to remind yourself that this is a new chapter and try to be more present with your new peers. Is there anything in particular that you're looking forward to or a goal you'd like to achieve in your new job?
It's important to recognize that worrying too much might have held you back in the past. I can sense that you don't want to repeat that behavior.

It's understandable that you're feeling this way when leaving your loved ones, as it reflects the deep bond you have with them. However, it's important to remember that people have a natural ability to adapt and grow, even in challenging situations. Demanding to be there for them continuously may actually hinder their ability to develop their skills and emotional resilience. Trust in their strength and learn to let go gradually. Do you think giving them more opportunities to become independent might help ease your concerns?
It must have been really difficult for you to witness their grief and it's understandable that you feel remorse. However, I think it was very thoughtful of you to let them know first.

Remember, relationships might take time to heal, but it's important to keep communication open and honest.

As a counsellor, I acknowledge your concerns and understand that raising children can be challenging. It's natural to want to make the best decisions for them. However, it's also important to remember that nobody is perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes as a parent.

This change in perspective might help relieve some of your worries.

Practice and patience can be key, so keep working on it and remember that everyone learns at their own pace.
It's important for both you and your husband to work with a therapist to address these issues. However, if he's unwilling to attend therapy or take responsibility, it may indicate a poor prognosis for the marriage. I don't have a final opinion right now, and this decision will require more discussion and consideration. Meanwhile, focusing on your own therapy and self-care is vital.
It's important to acknowledge your feelings of being trapped, and it's good that you're recognizing the similarities between your current relationship and past experiences.

Maybe you could try discussing your feelings with your husband and work on resolving the issues together, so you don't feel stuck anymore.
I understand that managing your husband's blood sugar can be challenging, especially within such a tight timeframe. To help maintain his sugar levels and overall mood, consider offering him healthy snacks throughout the day and planning meals in advance. Additionally, consult a healthcare professional for further guidance regarding dietary plans and strategies to better manage his borderline condition. It's essential to work as a team and address this issue calmly and proactively.
It's normal to feel some empathy towards your partner even when you're planning to leave the situation. However, it's important to prioritize your well-being and that of your children. It's okay to acknowledge his struggles, but if the relationship is not healthy, you still have the right to make decisions for your own happiness. Reflect on your feelings and ensure that you are considering the needs of everyone involved, including yourself.
While your husband's expectation for dinner to be ready in a certain window due to his work and blood sugar issues is not unreasonable, the fact that he gets upset and can become physically abusive is concerning. It's important to address this issue and determine if the two of you can work together to establish better communication and understanding. Have you considered seeking professional help or a support system to address these abusive behaviors?
As a counsellor, I understand that it must be quite challenging to deal with this situation, considering the various aspects involved. I believe you made the right decision by seeking help.

It's important to find balance and work through the emotions in order to make the best decision for you and your family.
It's completely normal to feel confused and conflicted in your situation. It's a complicated decision to make, and something we can discuss and explore further.

We'll have another meeting to discuss this further, and we will be here to support you along the way.
As a counsellor, I understand that it is difficult for your children to completely detach from their father even if he's not the one they need. This is because he is a biological connection and there is a natural longing for love from a parent. Even if he were mean all the time, that biological connection could still remain and make it difficult for them to let go. It's essential to acknowledge and work through these emotions as part of the healing process.
It's great that you're aiming to improve in those roles, but it's also important to recognize that nobody is perfect. It's normal to have moments of guilt or struggle. What you can do is focus on setting realistic goals, celebrating your achievements, and keeping a balance between your various roles. Remember to allow yourself moments of self-care too, as it's essential for overall well-being.
It's important to understand that your husband's actions are not a reflection of your performance as a wife and mother. It's not your fault, and his response is an inaccurate evaluation of the situation. His anger might be stemming from other factors, and it's essential for both of you to have a conversation and find healthier ways to deal with stress. Is there anything specific that triggers his anger?
It's understandable to feel doubtful, but it's crucial to recognize that there are major differences between your past and present situations. When you were a child, you didn't have the power or choice to change your circumstances. However, in your current situation, you have agency and the ability to make decisions like coming here for help or considering divorce. It's a significant sign of progress and personal growth.
It's understandable that you formed an attachment to your parents, as it is a natural inclination for mammals to bond with their caregivers. However, in your case, this bond was complicated by the fact that your parents were also the cause of your distress.

Have you considered seeking therapy to help you process and heal from this trauma?
That's a very good question. I absolutely agree that the emphasis is on the problem now.

I'm glad to hear that you find some relief in knowing that others don't view you as crazy. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique struggles and challenges, so it's not fair to label oneself as a 'nut' or 'crazy'. In our upcoming sessions, we can work on exploring the thoughts and feelings underlying this self-perception and develop strategies to build self-compassion and a healthier self-image.
I appreciate you opening up and sharing your feelings.

Do you feel like this expectation is affecting your current relationships and how you perceive yourself as a provider?
It's great to hear that you're close to your mother, but it seems like there's a gap when it comes to discussing personal matters.

In addition, it's okay to feel nervous or uncertain about opening up, but remember, it's important to establish open communication in every relationship, especially with our family members.
As a counsellor, I would say that facing and expressing your emotions can actually be helpful for you. It's true that avoiding and holding them in can make them worse.

It seems like you're experiencing an issue called 'satisficing,' which is the opposite of perfectionism. I understand your fear of not making your artwork perfect and how it stops you from even trying. One thing to consider is working on embracing imperfections and not catastrophizing small flaws. Remember, art is a process, and it's normal to make mistakes during that process. Do you recall when this fear started or any specific event that triggered it?
It's great that you're open to trying satisficing. It's normal for it to be challenging at first, especially when people critique your work. What's important is to remember that their critiques are not a reflection of who you are.

However, if you feel this is causing you distress or discomfort, could you share some specific situations where this has happened and possibly any underlying reasons you might have for doing so?
It seems like you're struggling with feelings of shame and guilt, and you're seeking immediate relief through substance use. This can indeed provide temporary relief, but it is not a healthy or sustainable coping mechanism. Instead, it's essential to work on understanding and accepting your past actions and learning healthier ways to cope with your emotions. Have you tried seeking professional help or support groups to address these feelings?
While alcohol and drugs might provide temporary relief from stress and pain, they can lead to long-term complications and financial burden. Instead, consider exploring alternative coping strategies such as meditation, yoga, or biofeedback, which can be healthy and cost-effective. Remember, it's essential to address the root causes of your stress and pain in order to find lasting solutions.
It's understandable that you're concerned about giving in to this behavior and possibly feeling more depressed.

Working on communication and building a healthy relationship with both your partner and her children may help resolve these issues.
It seems like you're using criticism of others to boost your self-esteem momentarily.

Are there any other specific goals you think we should explore simultaneously?
Now, when you take the marijuana, you have a craving for it, you know you'd rather not but you still take it. What do you think you're saying to yourself to make yourself take it?
It's understandable that you would like to do well and be approved by others, but it's essential to differentiate between liking something and needing it. Instead of focusing on the idea that you must perform well, try focusing on the idea that it's preferable but not necessary. This shift in mindset can help reduce your self-consciousness and allow you to speak more freely without the pressure of needing approval. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them.
It is completely understandable that you have negative feelings about your upbringing and your parents' lack of education. It's great that you have recognized the need to create a better life for yourself by going back to college.

It seems like your father, and others who exhibit this behavior, might have been using alcohol as a way to cope with their introversion and other issues they couldn't handle. It's tough to watch someone you care about go through difficult times without being able to help them. When observing this behavior, try to remind yourself that they are also struggling with their internal battles and may not be fully aware of how it's affecting them or others around them. Is there any specific event or memory that has made this pattern particularly concerning for you?
It sounds like the person you're talking about struggled with alcohol addiction and possibly prioritized it over his health and wellbeing. It would be essential to address the underlying reasons for his addiction. As a counsellor, I would try to help him identify his core beliefs and emotional disturbances and work on adopting healthier coping strategies to deal with them. Can you provide more details about what you think might have been the main factors causing his addiction and struggle to change?
It's important to understand that early childhood experiences don't necessarily cause disturbances, but rather the thoughts we hold on to. In your case, feeling self-conscious and shy might stem from internal demands and preferences. Instead of relying on substances to open up, you could work on changing your thought patterns and developing a healthier self-image.
You're welcome, and I appreciate your willingness to discuss your concerns. Remember, understanding and addressing the problem is the first step towards improvement. Based on what you've shared, here are some suggestions and techniques to work on. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
It sounds like you've internalized the negative beliefs about yourself from your family, which might be affecting your overall well-being. It's important to question why you would want to believe these negative thoughts about yourself. Is it possible that you use these feelings as a coping mechanism or an excuse to indulge in unhealthy behaviors? Remember, you have the power to choose your own beliefs and actions, regardless of what others might have said about you.
It sounds like you're experiencing difficulties in resisting your urges to drink and use drugs. This is a common struggle for many people, but the good news is that change is possible. It will require a strong commitment and a lot of effort on your part, but with the right support and determination, you can work towards overcoming these challenges. Have you considered seeking professional help or joining a support group to assist you on your journey?
It's great that you are acknowledging your self-doubt and willing to work on it. Remember, facing the issue might be difficult in the short run, but it will benefit you in the long run. I suggest you read the book 'How To Stubbornly Refuse To Make Yourself Miserable About Anything' as it can help you tackle the self-doubt that lies at the core of your problems. Remember, exploring this aspect is crucial in overcoming your struggles.
It's important to focus on developing unconditional self-acceptance, regardless of your situation or struggles with substances. Remember that you are valuable and worthy, even when you make mistakes. I suggest you work on cultivating positive self-talk and practicing emotional regulation techniques. Is there a specific situation or event that has been particularly challenging for you?
You seem to be struggling with self-acceptance and the consequences of your actions, particularly around alcohol and drug use. It's important to recognize that you are a fallible human being who makes mistakes, but that doesn't make you a bad person. Rather than focusing on your mistakes, work on accepting yourself as a fallible person and concentrate on making improvements in your behavior. One reason you may feel depressed is that you believe you're no good, and that using substances is a way to cope with those feelings. Recognizing this pattern and making a cognitive shift towards accepting yourself without approval from substances can help you create long-lasting change.
It's important to recognize that we all make mistakes and have our own ways of coping with the past. It's normal to feel guilt or regret, but focusing on improving yourself and valuing your connections with others may help you find peace. What are your feelings or thoughts about your parents now?
It's understandable that you want to distance yourself from painful memories, but it's important to recognize that you don't have to be perfect or completely get away from your past in order to feel better. It's great to have good friends for support, but try not to make it a dire necessity, as this can lead to anxiety and unhealthy coping mechanisms like alcohol or drugs. Instead, focus on turning your desires into preferences, and remember that it's okay to not always meet every expectation you set for yourself.
It's understandable to have negative feelings about one's past, and it's a good step that you're trying to change your perspective. It's important to remind yourself that your past doesn't define who you are today. Keep working on changing your mindset by acknowledging the progress you've made and focusing on the present and future. It might take time, but with practice, you'll gradually be able to reduce the impact of your past on your emotions.
It's important to recognize the distinction between criticizing your behavior and damning yourself. You're a fallible human who doesn't need to damn yourself for anything, but it's okay to recognize when behavior isn't helpful.

The book includes perspectives of other people who have gone through similar experiences, which might be helpful for understanding your own journey better. It discusses the shift from accepting one's sexuality to finding a path forward.

Since you've already identified a coming out support group, attending their meetings could be an excellent starting point. Additionally, we can brainstorm a list of different settings and activities where you might have an opportunity to meet other gay people, so you can explore multiple options.

It sounds like you're dealing with societal expectations and family pressure regarding relationships, which can be challenging when you don't fit into the norm.

Is there something specific that recently triggered these feelings?
It's understandable that you are worried about how people might react, especially when you've experienced negative comments from your family members. It's important to remember that people's opinions can change and develop over time. One option could be to have an open and honest conversation with your family, discussing your feelings and addressing their concerns. Remember, you are not required to face this alone and can seek help from friends or support groups for guidance and emotional support.
As the counsellor, I understand that you've had this belief for a long time and have experienced indirect comments from society and family. Since no one has found out or rejected you, maybe we can test if your belief holds in reality. As you haven't told anyone yet, it's important to consider how opening up might change the situation or your relationships.
It seems like you've been struggling with feeling invisible and unlovable for a long time. It's important to recognize that these feelings are valid, but they don't define your worth or who you are as a person. Can you recall any specific experiences or moments where these feelings of being unlovable were particularly strong?
It's understandable that you might feel different and unlovable due to the powerful belief you've held for a long time. This belief seems to underlie many situations and experiences you've had. Remember that everyone has their own path, and it's important to focus on what makes you happy and comfortable. Have you thought about seeking support from others who might have similar experiences or feelings?

Remember, telling people about your true self may actually bring them closer to you, as it shows your trust and vulnerability. It's important to focus on the positive outcomes, like building stronger relationships with the ones who accept and support you.
I understand that it can be uncomfortable to share something so personal with others, especially if you're not used to it. We could work on this together and identify some people whom you might feel comfortable telling and build on your experiences.

It's great that you're considering opening up to someone about your issue. Telling someone you trust, like your friend Rhianne, can be a helpful step towards understanding the reality of your belief. Remember that it's normal to feel nervous, but it's important to challenge your thoughts and see if they hold true. How do you think Rhianne might react when you share your concern with her?
It's great that you want to open up to your friend Rhianne. It would be a good idea to first test the hypothesis that she might reject you by simply talking to her about it. You can start the conversation by saying, 'Rhianne, I have something to tell you.' Give it a try and see how the conversation goes. Remember, over the past couple of weeks, we've discovered that the belief that people will reject you if they find out you're gay isn't completely accurate. What's happened to shift your belief?
It seems like your belief was challenged when you shared with your friend, Rhianne, and she responded positively, feeling closer to you. This is a great example of how opening up can strengthen relationships and help you realize that people might understand and support you more than you originally thought. Keep this experience in mind as you continue to navigate your connections with others.
It sounds like you're struggling with consistency in your daily routines. It's important to recognize that consistency takes time to develop. Instead of trying to achieve perfection right away, try setting smaller, achievable goals. For instance, instead of committing to showering every day, start with showering every other day. As you start achieving these smaller goals, your confidence will increase, and you can gradually increase the frequency of your showers. Remember, progress is better than perfection.
It's great that you have made some progress and are feeling better in the short term. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when thinking about maintaining this for a lifetime. Instead, try focusing on smaller goals and building blocks. Have confidence in your ability to accomplish your goals and improve step by step. Remember, you don't have to be perfect right away, and you can always come back to therapy for support if needed.

As your counsellor, I want to help you explore the root of this issue. Let's try imagining a scenario: tonight, you go to sleep, and while you're asleep, a miracle happens. All the problems that have brought you into therapy are gone, and something much better replaces them. How would you feel when you wake up, and what would be different in your life?
It's great to hear that you are experiencing positive changes in your life after the miracle. It sounds like you are waking up with a more positive and excited mindset, replacing the doom and dread with anticipation for the day. It's important to embrace and acknowledge these changes in your mindset and allow them to guide your actions and decisions throughout the day.

It's important to recognize that progress in personal growth can sometimes be influenced by external factors, such as medications.

Try finding common ground or activities both of you enjoy, which might open up opportunities for more meaningful conversations. Is there any particular topic that you both enjoy discussing or an activity you can do together?
I understand your concern. However, improving your English skills might not necessarily be for discussing it with your future children, but rather for your personal growth and opportunities that could benefit your entire family in the long run. Would your partner be open to discussing the potential benefits and how it can improve the quality of life for your whole family?
It's great that you have a clear vision for your family and their happiness. Balancing multiple roles can indeed be challenging. Are there any specific concerns or areas where you feel you could use support in balancing your roles as a student, mom, and wife?

This might help you both make a more informed decision and ease the burden of feeling like you're doing this all by yourself.
It's great that you want to learn more about your culture. I have some connections at the school in the Diversity Office, and I can set up an appointment for us to go and get information. We won't involve your husband initially, but once we gather some information, we can discuss how to include him so he doesn't feel left out or betrayed. I'll make the phone calls and arrange our next appointment at the Diversity Center. Does that sound good to you?
It sounds like you're struggling with balancing your roles as a student and a parent, and feeling a lot of pressure from what others expect of you. It's normal to feel overwhelmed with these responsibilities and fears about your child's well-being. Remember, it is possible to be both a good student and a good parent. Take a moment to reflect on your past accomplishments and think about what kind of support system you can create to help you manage both roles.

It sounds like you might have chosen your major based on the expectations of your parents and the prestige it holds, rather than your personal interests or strengths.

Are there any career paths or passions you would like to pursue instead of following what your parents expect?
It sounds like you're feeling pressured to meet the expectations of others, and that it's challenging for you to prioritize your own desires. Is there anyone in your life who would support you in focusing on what's really important to you and help you feel validated?
As a counsellor, my approach to talking to people might be different from yours. My primary goal is to maintain a supportive and understanding environment. If you could explain the reason you feel justified in talking to Julie that way, it would help me better understand the situation and provide appropriate guidance.
It's important to address the issue without making things worse. Try talking to her in a different way than she's used to, in a more understanding and empathetic manner. Also, would you be open to having a third person mediate the conversation between you two, if needed?
First, I appreciate your willingness to make an effort in improving your relationship with your teacher. Based on your description, when you walk into the classroom, you look at the teacher. I would suggest you start by offering a friendly greeting or a smile when you enter. This will set a positive tone for your interaction with her. And, if you are comfortable with the idea, we can schedule a meeting with you, me, and the teacher to discuss your concerns and find a way to improve the situation together.
It sounds like you're struggling with communication in this friendship. Non-verbal communication, like giving a look, can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. Have you tried expressing your feelings and thoughts openly with your friend? Clear and open communication can help prevent any misunderstandings and strengthen the bond between friends.
It's understandable to feel overwhelmed with this new commitment. Let's focus on taking it one step at a time. Tomorrow, you can reach out to your instructor or classmates to catch up on the missed class and inquire about the homework. Remember that it's okay to ask for help and support from others. You can do this!
I understand your concern. It's important to complete your assignments for better understanding and progress. As your counsellor, I can approach your teacher on your behalf and get the assignment for you. However, you'll need to come by my office at the end of the day to pick it up. Would that work for you?
It's great that you're working with a counselor to manage this situation. I'll try my best to talk to your teacher today to let her know about your efforts and the progress you're making. However, I cannot guarantee that she will be nice to you immediately, as that will depend on her willingness to understand and change her behavior. Keep working with your counselor and continue being patient as these situations often take time to improve.
It sounds like you're trying to communicate your feelings or emotions to someone, but you're worried about how they might react or perceive what you're saying. As a counsellor, I suggest being open and honest with the person about your thoughts and feelings. Remember, it's important to express yourself and let others understand your perspective.
It's possible that this approach could make her wonder what's going on and potentially lead to a happier work environment for both of you. However, there's no guarantee that it will work. If you want to improve your relationship, consider discussing your concerns directly with her and working together to find a solution. Just remember, trying something is better than staying in a miserable situation.
It sounds like you're having a difficult time with your schoolwork and feeling left out by your teacher.

It might help bridge the gap and make you feel more included in the learning process.
It sounds like you're struggling with the expectations your teacher has around homework. It's important to try and understand the purpose of homework and how it can help you learn. Rather than focusing on negative feelings, would you like to discuss any challenges that might be making it difficult for you to complete and submit it on time?
I appreciate that you find me approachable, and I'm glad you're willing to give the homework a chance. How about you start with just one night in the week and see how it goes? Remember, the homework is for your benefit, and we can adjust it as needed to make it work for you.
It's understandable that you feel disrespected when your teacher talks to you in that manner. However, I think it's important to consider the impact of involving a third party in this situation. It could potentially make things worse if your teacher got upset with someone else as well. Instead, have you thought about addressing the issue directly with your teacher in a calm and respectful manner?
As a counsellor, my goal is to help improve the situation, so aggravating the teacher, in this case, may not be the best course of action. Instead, let's focus on understanding why the teacher is treating you this way and explore potential solutions to improve your relationship with her. I might try discussing your concerns with her in a more constructive way, emphasizing the importance of a healthy teacher-student relationship rather than focusing on her negatives.
I understand that you're concerned about making things worse. If I may be blunt, it's important to acknowledge your feelings and trust yourself in handling situations. Just to make sure I'm addressing your concern properly, could you please provide more details about the specific situation you are facing?
It can be frustrating when it seems like authority figures are constantly exerting control over others, especially in difficult environments like juvenile facilities or schools. It's important to try and understand the reasons behind their actions and to focus on what you can do to improve your own situation. If you're concerned about your friend, try offering support and encouraging them to seek help or rehabilitation for any issues they might be facing.
As a counsellor, I understand your concerns about being unfairly targeted by authorities. However, it's important to remember that the police are responsible for maintaining law and order, and their actions might not always seem fair or pleasant. Try focusing on your own actions and ensuring that you are not breaking any laws or rules, and you'll be less likely to encounter trouble from the police.
It's important to maintain a healthy relationship with your probation officer, as they can provide valuable guidance and support during your probation period. Can you share more about your interactions with him and if there are any concerns or difficulties you're facing?

I would advise focusing on other hobbies and finding healthier ways to cope with stress or boredom. If you'd like, we can discuss alternative coping strategies or healthier ways to relax and enjoy life.
It's important that we keep an open line of communication with others, including your teachers. They might have sent you here because they're concerned about your well-being or academic progress. Can you think of any recent events or changes in your behavior that might have caused them to be concerned?
It appears that you may be struggling with some communication or behavioral issues in class that are affecting your relationships with your classmates.

I understand that having friends in juvenile detention might be difficult for you, but staying in school and making positive choices can lead to a better future. Is there anything specific that worries you about staying in school for the next eight months?
As a counsellor, I understand your concerns with the food and the highly secure environment. It's important to remember that the facility is there to help you, and the staff is working to create a safe and structured environment for your recovery. Can you tell me more about your interactions with the staff members there? This will help me understand your experience better and offer proper guidance.

Let's continue our conversation and work together to address your concerns and explore potential solutions.
I understand that it's important for you to feel heard and treated fairly. It's not right for anyone to treat others differently based on their family background. I'm here to talk and support you. Do you have any specific situations in which you felt this way that you can share?
I understand your concerns and it's important to address these issues. Let's focus on how we can improve your situation first. How about we start by discussing ways to help teachers treat you better? We can also consider talking with the principal to create a better environment for you and others who feel the same.
I understand that it's distressing when people treat you poorly. It's important to remember that you deserve respect and kindness, just like anyone else. If you'd like, we can explore strategies for handling this situation and building your self-esteem. Are there any specific instances you'd like to discuss?
It's important to recognize the potential consequences of smoking pot regularly, including legal troubles and the impact on your health. Regardless of whether I have personal experience with marijuana, as a counsellor, my role is to provide guidance rooted in facts, not personal opinions. I would suggest reflecting on the reasons behind your marijuana use and consider the potential risks it poses to your future. Do you feel that your marijuana use is impacting your life negatively in any way?
It sounds like you're feeling trapped or uncomfortable in your current situation. Can you please provide more information about the specific situation or environment you're in, and what is causing you distress?
I hear your frustration, and I want you to know that I genuinely want to help and understand your situation. Instead of giving you a lecture, let's have a real conversation about what's going on in your life. What do you think is holding you back from making the changes you know you need to make?
As a counsellor, I acknowledge that you have had the same discussion multiple times, which must be frustrating. Instead of repeating the lecture, let's identify the underlying concerns and work together on a different approach to address your issues more effectively.
I understand that hearing such comments can be hurtful. It seems like you don't appreciate their way of communicating with you. However, remember that you have control over how you react to their words. Do you think their opinion matters that much to you, or is it more about how they convey their thoughts?
It sounds like you're struggling with some feelings of boredom and possibly frustration with your teacher. Also, not doing homework might be affecting your academic performance. Can you share the reason behind not doing your homework? It's important to address these issues and find healthier coping mechanisms, such as seeking help or engaging with the class materials in a different way.
I understand that you feel frustrated with how adults present information about pot, and you think it's better than drinking. It's important for you to receive truthful, respectful information. What kind of information or approach would you prefer when discussing this topic to make you feel more comfortable and respected?
I understand that feeling respected and treated fairly is essential for you. It's crucial for everyone to communicate respectfully and acknowledge each other's feelings and thoughts. If you have any specific incidents or issues you'd like to discuss, please feel free to share.
It's good that you're willing to greet your teacher, even if you can't smile. However, it would be better if you try to put some emphasis and enthusiasm on the greeting, like saying 'Good morning Ms. Bannan' with excitement. This can help to create a positive environment and might help you feel more comfortable and confident in school.
It's normal to feel fake at the beginning when trying to change a behavior or interaction with someone. It usually takes some time, like five days or so, before it starts to feel more natural. If she says something rude, try to stay calm and maintain a positive attitude. Do you have any specific situation in mind that you think might happen?
It's important to recognize that we cannot control other people's actions. One approach you can take is to change your own behavior in the situation. For example, you could try entering the room and directly going to your desk without looking for a reaction from your teacher. This might help to reduce the negative interaction between the two of you. Additionally, consider practicing a positive greeting like saying good morning. This could help you build a better relationship with your teacher.
It sounds like you're dealing with a difficult situation. One suggestion might be to focus on becoming your best self, by improving in areas where you feel you can grow. This way, it would be challenging for your mother to find things to criticize. It could also confuse her initially, leading her to reevaluate her approach. Keep in mind, though, that you should grow for your own well-being, not just to avoid criticism.
Can I make a suggestion? Suppose, just suppose you walk in and you look at her and you say good morning, and you smile. Just like you just did, see you smiled just now. Up until now you haven't. Let me put it this way, would it help or would it hurt?
I understand you're feeling upset about the situation, and I'm here to help. How about trying to greet your teacher with a genuine smile and a warm 'Good morning'? This might help improve the relationship between you and your teacher, making both of you feel more comfortable. It's important to approach this with a positive attitude to see any positive results.
It's understandable that you find it challenging, but remember, you don't appear weak. Some people take weeks to even consider this kind of suggestion. It may not seem like a big deal, but it's an important step. How did it feel when you said 'Good morning'?
It's common for people to feel like they are just going through the motions or feeling disconnected from reality. Engaging in activities where we pretend or escape, like watching movies or playing games, can contribute to this feeling. You might want to consider exploring new activities or hobbies that can help you feel more connected and grounded in your everyday life.
I understand that you're feeling disrespected and hurt by Ms. Bannan's behavior. It's important to address this issue in a constructive way. Have you tried speaking to her privately about how her actions affect you or discussing the situation with a school counselor or administrator for support?
I understand that it's distressing to be treated that way by your teacher. It's important to remember that such comments don't define your worth as a student or a person. If you feel comfortable, you could try discussing the issue with a trusted adult or someone in a higher position in the school, who may have the ability to address your concerns and help create a more supportive environment for you.
Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It's unfortunate that you've been feeling unheard and dismissed by others. But I genuinely appreciated your lecture and found your ideas valuable.

If you'd like, we could explore some strategies to improve your communication skills and help you feel more heard in the future.
It's important to acknowledge that people's opinions and perceptions of us don't define our worth. No one can change their behavior overnight, and it's unrealistic to expect someone to be nice all the time. Recognize that you're not bad, and focus on finding the positive aspects of yourself. Remember, now there are two people who don't think you're bad - me, and more importantly, yourself.
I appreciate your willingness to work on the issues and your commitment to follow through. I will definitely talk to Ms. Bannan about the situation. In the meantime, let's focus on identifying what caused the mistakes and how we can prevent them in the future.
As a counsellor, I understand that you might find it more convenient to stop by during math. However, it's important that we stick to the arranged schedule and meet before school starts.

That's a great idea! Exploring the opposite of neediness, such as power and self-sufficiency, can help you find balance and alternative ways of achieving emotional stability. Try to identify situations where you can practice being self-sufficient, and slowly build on your confidence. Remember, change is a gradual process, so be patient and persistent.
It's great that you're working on imagining yourself as self-sufficient and powerful. Practice envisioning yourself in various situations where you're independent and not relying on others. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, but it's also important to build confidence in taking care of yourself. How else can you practice independence in your daily life?
As a counsellor, I acknowledge your feelings of independence and self-sufficiency, which can be a great strength. However, while it's important to have a balanced life and know how to be on your own, maintaining healthy relationships is crucial for our mental well-being. What specific situations make you feel the need to distance yourself from talking to or connecting with others?
It's great that you've had a chance to experiment with different roles and discovered the sense of completeness in being self-sufficient. To integrate this experience into your life, start by reflecting on which aspects of the powerful persona felt authentic to you. Gradually incorporate those aspects into your daily behavior, and make sure to acknowledge and reward yourself when you notice yourself embracing that sense of self-sufficiency. Also, keeping a journal to track your progress and thoughts may help you in this journey.
I understand your concern about being needy. Let's try an experiment to help change this behavior. I want you to exaggerate your feeling of neediness and be needier than you actually are, to say needier things than you actually experience. This might help you gain insight into your behavior and find ways to improve it.
It must be really challenging for you to feel like you don't have the support you need. Have you tried discussing these feelings with your close friends or family members? They might not be aware that you're struggling. Open up to them and let them know the importance of their presence in your life.
It's good that you recognize this behavior and want to change it. To deal with neediness, you can practice self-reliance, set boundaries, and invest in personal growth. Identifying the root cause for this behavior can also help. Can you think of any potential triggers or events that led you to feel this heightened neediness?
It's good that you're becoming more aware of your behavior and are seeking ways to manage it. Other people might perceive your neediness more intensely than you realize. Remember to turn the volume down as a cue to minimize the impact of your needy behavior on others. This will help you build healthier relationships and improve your communication skills.
Okay. So remember, just like how you had the choice of acting more needy or more self-sufficient, you have choices in any situation. You can either act needier or act more self-sufficient. Can you take that awareness with you and try incorporating it in your life?
I understand that it's difficult for you to manage your emotions when you feel that your partner is siding with his parents. It's important for both of you to communicate openly about your feelings and work together to resolve the issues. Perhaps, you could consider finding a time to discuss these things with your partner without involving his parents. Remember, you have the power to effect change in your relationship, so don't repress your feelings – rather, try to express them calmly and openly.
It sounds like you're dealing with a difficult situation. It's understandable that you're angry, as it seems their rejection affects both you and your relationship.

What do you think can be done to improve the situation with your friend and his family?
It's understandable that you are feeling resentment and difficulty in dealing with the breakup, especially when it's over something as personal as religion. It's important to acknowledge these feelings, but also consider that people's beliefs can change over time and it might not be completely their fault if their family holds a strong influence over them. Maybe try to focus on understanding their point of view, and seek activities or support groups that can help you cope with the situation and enable you to move on.
It's understandable that you feel resentful about the situation, especially if you believe your partner's parents' interference was the reason for the relationship ending. However, it's essential to recognize that sometimes, we may be interpreting situations in a specific way due to our own beliefs and emotions. Is there any possibility that you might be seeing their actions as interference when, in fact, they might have had different intentions?
I understand that you are a sensitive person and that when people act badly, you feel intense anger and rejection. It's important to remember that everyone reacts differently to situations, and your sensitivity is a part of who you are. The key is to identify the thoughts and beliefs that are driving your anger, and work on changing those thoughts to better manage your emotions. Remember, you don't have to be angry - it's a choice you can work on controlling.
I understand both your feelings of hurt and anger due to the rejection you have experienced. Let's start with addressing the anger first, then we'll focus on the feelings of rejection. We can work together to find healthy ways for you to manage these emotions and break the cycle of belittling yourself. Can you share a specific situation where you felt this way?
It's important to recognize that you're a fallible human and will have moments of weakness.

You're right in acknowledging that we all feel vulnerable and weak at times, but it's important to remember that you're okay even when you're weak. However, try not to practice weakness or dwell too much on it. Instead, practice positive coping methods - daily exercises where you imagine yourself feeling down or weak, and then change your mindset with positive, empowering thoughts. This will help train your mind not to put yourself down and to build resilience.
It's important to recognize that you can't control others' actions or opinions, but you can work on accepting and managing your reactions to them. Instead of wishing to have that power, focus on building your inner strength and resilience, so that you can cope and live with the circumstances. Remember, you can only change yourself and how you respond to the world around you.
It's normal to feel upset when people put you down or treat you poorly. Remember, it's okay to set boundaries and protect yourself. Sometimes people feel weak in such situations because they haven't developed their assertiveness skills.

Just remember that self-compassion and self-care are important when dealing with conflicts. Are there any specific situations where you struggle to assert yourself?
As a counsellor, I would suggest that if the patient avoids doing the rational emotive imagery exercise they should spend at least an hour cleaning their apartment. If the apartment gets too clean, they could help clean their neighbors' apartments. This will help them face their dislike for cleaning and provide motivation to complete the exercise.
It seems like your primary concern is the resentment towards your partner for not being able to stand up to his parents. It's understandable to feel this way, but it's important to remember that he's a fallible human with his own issues.

It's important to recognize that your eating disorder may have developed due to various factors in your life, rather than solely blaming yourself or your parents.

Do you feel like you needed more emotional support from your mother?
It's important to recognize that people show love and affection in different ways, and it seems your mother expressed her love through acts of service.

Focus on working towards improvement rather than feeling pressured to be calm at all times.
That's great that you recognized the emotional burden guilt and anger were causing, and were able to let go of those feelings. It's important to acknowledge our emotions and make conscious decisions to change how we react to them for our mental well-being. Keep up the good work and remember that you have the power to choose your own emotional responses.
