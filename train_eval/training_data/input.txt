Lately, I've been feeling really disconnected from reality. I often find it hard to distinguish between what's real and what's not. For example, last week, I was having dinner with my family, and I suddenly thought my brother was about to attack me. I know it doesn't make any sense, but it felt real in that moment. This has happened a few times, but not all the time. I'm also having a hard time concentrating and remembering things that have happened recently. I've had some depressive episodes in the past, but this seems a bit different to me. Can you help me figure out what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed and it's affecting me a lot. Sometimes I find it hard to focus on what people are saying, or I get easily confused. I have noticed that my mood has been low for weeks now, but I haven't had any hallucinations or delusions. One day, I was walking in a crowded place and suddenly, I felt completely detached from everyone around me; it was like seeing the world through a thick fog. My family says that I am being distant and they worry about me, and I'm starting to worry about myself too.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I sometimes find it hard to focus and concentrate on tasks, but it doesn't happen too often. I have been feeling a bit disconnected from my friends, but we still hang out and talk normally. My sleeping habits haven't changed much, but I occasionally have some vivid dreams. For the past two months, there were two unusual events where I saw flashes of light that weren't there. I don't think I've experienced any hallucinations, though. My performance at work hasn't been affected, and I can still function normally.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I've noticed that I've been having trouble concentrating at work, and I can't seem to shake off this feeling of sadness. I've lost interest in some activities I used to enjoy, like going out with friends. But, I don't have any hallucinations or hear voices. Recently, I also had a falling out with my best friend, and it's been difficult for me to understand their perspective. I tend to see things in black and white, but I don't think that others are out to get me or that I'm part of some conspiracy. These feelings have been going on for a few weeks now, and I just wanted to get some guidance on what might be going on.
Lately, I've been feeling quite off. I have been experiencing some strange sensations, like I'm being watched or my thoughts are being read. I know it sounds weird, but sometimes, I just can't shake those feelings. My friends and family have noticed that I've been more withdrawn and even struggle with basic conversations. My sleep has been disturbed, and my appetite has decreased as well.
Lately, life has been pretty tough. I've been feeling unusually paranoid about people around me, and I can't seem to concentrate on anything anymore. It's causing issues at work and in my relationships, as people are starting to think that I'm going crazy. I've even been seeing and hearing things that aren't there, but only occasionally. I'm also experiencing a lack of motivation and emotional expression. It's getting harder to get out of bed, and even when I do, it feels like I'm in a daze, completely disconnected from my own emotions and from other people. Can you help me figure out what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling really out of sorts. I can't concentrate on anything and I've noticed that I've been more paranoid about people around me. Last week, my boss asked me a simple question and I felt like she was accusing me of something. I haven't been sleeping well, and I keep hearing noises in the night that I can't explain. Also, I feel like my thoughts are all over the place - sometimes it's difficult to focus on one thing. Does this sound like anything serious?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit weird. I've always been an introverted person, but these past few weeks, I feel even more isolated. I've started hearing voices occasionally—whispers that I can't really understand. It's getting hard for me to concentrate on my studies and work. Last week, I was on my usual morning run when I suddenly felt like someone was following me. I got paranoid and had to abandon the run. I'm not sure what's happening to me.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. I don't know how to explain it, but I've been experiencing racing thoughts and feeling slightly paranoid about people, like they might be talking about me behind my back. There was this one incident at work where I swore I heard people whispering about me, but when I asked about it, they looked at me like I was crazy. On top of that, I've been having some trouble sleeping, and my appetite is all over the place. I don't know, maybe it's just stress or something?
I've been feeling really on edge lately, and the other day, I thought I heard someone calling my name, but there was nobody around. I've had trouble concentrating, and my thoughts seem to go in all directions. It feels like there's a lot of noise in my head. It's difficult to have conversations with people because I can't stay focused on what they're saying, and my thoughts wander off. I've been having trouble sleeping too. My neighbor told me she thought she saw someone lurking around my apartment, and I can't shake the feeling that someone is watching me.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit disconnected from everything. Last week, I was sitting in my apartment, and it felt like the walls were closing in on me. Sometimes, I think I hear people whispering about me when I'm outside, but when I turn around, nobody is there. I've been finding it hard to focus and stay organized. However, aside from those whispering incidents, I haven't experienced any other clear hallucinations or delusions. Also, I can still maintain relationships with my friends and family. It's just hard for me to wrap my head around what's going on.
Lately, I've been going through a tough time. It seems like some days I can't stop my thoughts from racing. I often find it hard to concentrate on anything. I've also been feeling lonely and isolated from people around me, even though I have a loving family. At work, my performance hasn't been as good as usual, and I've been missing deadlines. Last night, I thought I heard my boss whispering about me, but I'm not really sure. I'm struggling, but I'm not sure if it's something more serious or just a phase.
Lately, I've been feeling really disconnected from the people around me. Even when I'm with friends or family, I feel like they're talking about me behind my back and trying to sabotage my life. I’ve had a few moments where I thought I heard them whispering about me, but when I confront them, they always deny it. I've also had trouble concentrating and keeping my train of thought, and sometimes I feel like my thoughts are racing. This has been going on for a few weeks now, but I haven’t noticed any significant changes in my mood or daily functioning.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit out of it. Sometimes I find it hard to focus, and I feel like people are always whispering about me. I feel like my relationships with my friends are strained and there's this constant tension, but I can't pinpoint why. The other day, I was talking to a friend, and I suddenly had this feeling that she was sending me secret messages through her body language. I know this sounds weird, but it's been on my mind quite a bit. Overall, I just don't feel like myself, and I'm not sure what's going on.
Lately, I've been going through a rough patch. I've been having trouble concentrating at work and lots of trouble sleeping. I see shadows in the corners of my eyes, but when I try to look directly at them, they disappear. I also sometimes hear faint voices that sound like whispers, but they're not very clear. I've been feeling pretty low, and I don't know how to cope with all these things happening to me. My family is worried because of the changes they see in me, and they don't understand it either. Is there something wrong with me?
Lately, I've been feeling pretty stressed and anxious. I'm having trouble focusing on my work, often losing track of time and not being able to accomplish much. I'm also noticing that I'm becoming more irritable and easily agitated with my friends and family. My sleep is disrupted too. I wake up frequently in the middle of the night and have a hard time falling back asleep. I don't really feel like myself, but I'm not sure what's going on.
Lately, I've been feeling really strange. I keep hearing things that others can't hear, like whispers or someone calling my name. It's nothing too specific, but it's really bothering me. Also, I've noticed a change in my daily habits. I'm losing interest in the things I used to love doing, like playing guitar and drawing. My friends say I've become distant and quiet, but it's really hard to concentrate on conversations. There are times when I feel like I'm in a fog, and I just can't think or speak clearly. I don't know what's going on and I'm scared.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. It's hard to explain, but I feel disconnected from reality sometimes. I've noticed that I have these strange thoughts and ideas, but they don't seem too serious. Additionally, I've been avoiding social situations because I feel uncomfortable and anxious. I think this has been going on for about a month now. It's affecting my daily life, but I can still go to work and maintain a somewhat normal routine. Is there something wrong with me?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I've been hearing some occasional whispers when there's no one around, but I don't have any other hallucinations, and it doesn't happen often. I've been doubting some people around me, but not excessively. I don't see changes in how I think, but I do feel a little disconnected from reality sometimes. Other things that bother me are slight irregularity in my thoughts and occasional social withdrawal. My work is not affected, and I can still function well in my daily life.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. It's like I can't trust my own senses. The other day, I thought I heard someone whispering my name, but when I turned around, there was no one there. I've been seeing shadows or shapes in the corner of my eyes, but when I try to focus on them, they disappear. I've also been having these weird dreams that feel so real, like I'm awake, and then I wake up and can't shake the feeling that they actually happened. I'm just so confused and scared, and I don't know what's going on with me.
Lately, I've been feeling like things are a bit off. I'm having trouble concentrating and keeping up with conversations. Sometimes, I can hear a faint voice in my head, but it's not too clear or persistent. Also, my emotions have been fluctuating quite a bit. I was really close to my family, but now I feel distant and struggle to connect with them. A couple weeks ago, I lost my job and I haven't been able to find motivation to look for a new one.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. I've been having trouble focusing and sometimes I even zone out during conversations. It's been like this for a few weeks now. I've also been having weird dreams that feel so real I can't even tell if I'm awake or not. A couple of times I thought I heard someone whispering my name, but when I looked around, there was no one there. It's really affecting my daily life and work, but I don't have any other symptoms. What's going on with me?
I've been struggling for a while now with some weird experiences. Sometimes, I feel like time is moving slower than usual, and it feels like my thinking has become really cloudy and disorganized. I've been hearing some strange, indistinct noises that others don't seem to hear. I've mentioned this to a close friend and they say it could be due to stress from work or lack of sleep, but I'm not really sure. It's affecting my ability to focus and my motivation to do everyday tasks. However, I do not experience hallucinations or delusions and my social life is okay.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. I've been getting confused a lot and sometimes I feel like I see things that aren't there or hear voices in my head. It's not all the time, maybe a couple of times a week. I also noticed that I've become more withdrawn and have been avoiding social situations. Just last week, I went to a party and felt increasingly paranoid, thinking people were talking behind my back. But I haven't had any strange beliefs or disorganized speech. I don't know, I'm just not feeling like myself anymore.
Lately, I have been feeling pretty off. I don't really know how to put it into words, but I can tell you one thing, I'm having a hard time focusing. Sometimes, I feel like I can hear someone talking to me but there's no one around. It has been happening for about a month now. Besides that, I have been feeling a bit detached from my friends and family but I can't say it's a complete disinterest as I still care a lot about them. And also, I don't feel like my thoughts are disorganized, just that I'm more preoccupied with the voices sometimes.
Lately, I've been feeling quite overwhelmed with my thoughts. For the past two weeks, I've been hearing muffled voices in my head, but I can't make out what they're saying. Additionally, I've been feeling disconnected from the people around me. Sometimes it's like I'm living in a bubble, and nothing seems real. I've been questioning the reality of my experiences, and I'm having trouble concentrating on my work and maintaining relationships. However, the voices I'm hearing are not constant and I don't have any delusions or paranoia. What do you think is going on?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I've been hearing whispers, but I can't really make out what they're saying. It doesn't happen all the time, only when I'm alone. On top of that, I've been getting slightly paranoid about my coworkers watching me or talking behind my back. I'm usually a pretty social person, but I've been feeling kind of isolated and lost in my own thoughts recently. The other day at work, I suddenly zoned out and started daydreaming about a previous vacation, and it felt almost like a flashback. It was hard to snap back into reality.
Lately, I've been feeling really disconnected from everyone. I sometimes think people are talking about me behind my back, but I don't actually hear any voices. I've been pretty disorganized too, and sometimes I have a hard time expressing myself clearly. It's been affecting my work, and I'm starting to worry about it. I don't know if this is relevant, but my cousin was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago.
Lately, I've been feeling quite stressed and overwhelmed. I'm finding it hard to concentrate and often second guess my own thoughts. I feel like people are watching me sometimes, but no one has said anything so I think it's just in my head. The other day my friend mentioned that I seemed a bit detached when we were hanging out. I've just been feeling a bit disconnected lately, I guess. It's been like this for a month or so. I'm worried that there's something seriously wrong with me.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I've had some trouble sleeping, and I keep having these fleeting thoughts that people around me are plotting against me. I also feel like I need to withdraw from my friends and family, but these feelings usually pass after a few hours and I'm back to normal. Sometimes I have a hard time distinguishing what's real from my imagination, but I don't have any hallucinations. Last week, I thought I saw a shadowy figure in my peripheral vision, but when I turned to look, there was nothing there. I still have a job, and my relationships are intact, but these strange thoughts and feelings are starting to worry me.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. Sometimes I hear my name being whispered, but when I turn around, no one is there. It only happens a couple times a week, and I can still manage my daily tasks just fine. However, my family has noticed I'm more withdrawn and seem less interested in social activities. My sleep has been pretty inconsistent too. Sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night and feel full of energy.
Lately, I've been feeling quite disconnected from the world. I sometimes find it hard to focus on my daily tasks and I've even started to withdraw from my friends and family. I don't know why, but I feel like they might be talking about me behind my back. The other day, I was at a party and it sounded like everyone was laughing at me. I do have mood swings as well, but they're not too frequent. My sleep has also been disturbed recently, but I don't see any unusual things or hear any weird voices.
Lately, my life has been really stressful. I've noticed that I have trouble concentrating and I've been feeling more irritable. I've started to distance myself from my family and friends, and I'm not sure why. I sometimes think I see things that aren't really there, but it's not very frequent or clear. My sleep has also been suffering because of all the worry and stress. I feel like I'm just not myself anymore.
Lately, I've been feeling like people are watching me wherever I go. Every time I'm out in public, it feels like everyone's eyes are on me, judging me. I've also noticed I'm a bit more disorganized than usual, like I can't finish a task without getting distracted and moving on to something else. The other day, I got into an argument with my family because they didn't believe me when I told them that the government is spying on me. I know it sounds crazy, but I really believe it's true. What's been going on with me?
Lately, I've been struggling with a few odd experiences. Sometimes I feel like people are talking about me, but when I try to listen closely, I can't make out what they're saying. It doesn't happen frequently, but it's been bothering me. Also, sometimes when I'm alone, I hear faint whispers, but it's hard to figure out if they are real or just my imagination. Overall, I've been feeling more anxious and low in energy for the past few weeks. I've also noticed that it's harder to concentrate during work. Do you think there's something wrong with me?
Lately, I've been feeling pretty strange. I haven't been sleeping well, and my thoughts are all over the place. Sometimes I feel like people are talking about me, but when I confront them, they deny it. The other day, I thought I heard my boss call my name, but when I asked him, he said he didn't. I'm also having trouble focusing at work and find it hard to make decisions. It's making my tasks take way longer than usual. What's going on with me?
Lately I've been feeling really overwhelmed with everything. I've been hearing strange noises like whispers, but I'm not sure if it's just my mind playing tricks on me. Sometimes, it's really hard for me to concentrate. I've been just drifting away in social situations and avoiding people altogether. It's causing me some distress, but it's not impacting my life that much. This has been going on for a couple of weeks now.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. It started with being unable to sleep well, and my thoughts have been racing uncontrollably. I can keep my focus during the day, but at night, I sometimes hear voices that seem like they're coming from the walls. They're not threatening or anything, just really annoying. I try to ignore them and usually succeed in tuning them out, but I would really like to get rid of them entirely. Apart from that, I can still manage my work and relationships, but I've been feeling quite socially isolated. Sometimes I wonder if people are talking about me behind my back, but I don't think it's anything serious. Can you help me understand what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. It started a few weeks ago when I thought I heard someone calling my name, but no one was there. It happened a couple of times, but it doesn't happen every day. I've also noticed that I sometimes struggle to concentrate and maintain focus. It feels like there's a fog in my head that I just can't shake. But, overall, I'm still managing to go to work and take care of my basic needs. Do you think there's something wrong with me?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit disconnected from reality. Sometimes I hear noises that aren't necessarily there, like whispers that seem to come from nowhere. I don't know if I should be worried or not, but it's not affecting my everyday life. About a month ago, I lost my job and I've noticed that I've been feeling more isolated from my friends and family. I tend to avoid social gatherings and just stay home most of the time. But I haven't experienced any hallucinations or delusions.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed at work. About a week ago, I started hearing voices when I was at home alone, but they were faint and I couldn't really make out what they were saying. I've been having some trouble sleeping too, but overall, I still feel like myself. The voices went away after a couple of days and now I'm just trying to manage my stress better. I haven't experienced any hallucinations or delusions, just those voices that one time.
Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with my job and family life. It all got worse when my mom passed away last month, and since then, I've been experiencing some weird moments. A few times, I thought I heard her voice calling my name, but I couldn't see her anywhere. These episodes only lasted for a few minutes, and they didn't happen every day. I know it's not normal to hear voices, but it doesn't seem like enough to be considered a serious mental issue. What do you think?
Lately, I've been feeling really on edge and I've been experiencing some things that are hard for me to explain. It all started after a really stressful week at work when I had a tight deadline to meet. I felt overwhelmed and started to notice that I was seeing these strange shadows on the wall, but they would disappear as soon as I looked directly at them. It's been happening for about two weeks now. Also, the other day, I thought I heard my neighbor calling my name when I was in my apartment, but when I went to check, they said they hadn't said anything. I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality, and it's starting to interfere with my ability to focus at work. Do you have any suggestions on what could be going on or how I can cope with this?
Lately, I've been going through a really rough patch in my life. I lost my job a month ago, and I've been having difficulty finding a new one. It's been causing me a lot of stress, and I've started to experience some strange things. Sometimes, I'll hear some whispering voices that seem to come from nowhere, but it doesn't happen all the time. They usually only last for a few minutes, and I can't always understand what they're saying. It's really starting to worry me because it never happened before. On top of that, I've become quite anxious and agitated. However, it has been only 3 days like this.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed out. My work has been taking a heavy toll on me. Over the past week, I've been hearing strange voices in my head when I'm alone. I know that it's not real, but it's distracting and unsettling. These voices don't really tell me to do anything or harm anyone, they're just random whispers. Apart from that, I haven't noticed any significant changes in my daily life, but it's been an unsettling experience. Can you help me understand what's happening?
Lately, I've been feeling quite overwhelmed with work, and I feel like I'm losing control of my life. Yesterday, I heard a voice whispering my name, but when I looked around, no one was there. It only happened once, and I haven't experienced any other hallucinations. To be honest, I'm not even sure if it was real or just my imagination. I've also been feeling more irritable than usual but nothing too severe. Can you please give me some guidance?
Lately, I've been feeling a little off. I started seeing things that others can't see, but it only happened a few times last month. I've also had moments where I felt disconnected from reality, but it doesn't last more than a few minutes. Yesterday, I got really paranoid when I was at the grocery store, and I thought people were talking about me. I don't know if this is normal or if I should be worried.
Lately, I've been feeling quite overwhelmed at work. A few days ago, I thought I saw my boss talking behind my back, but when I confronted him, he said it didn't happen. Sometimes, I feel like people are plotting against me, and I can't focus on my tasks. However, these thoughts only happen a few times a week, and they don't last that long. I often get a reality check when I see everything is normal around me. The stress just gets to me. I don't know what's going on.
Lately, I've been experiencing some strange things. For the past two weeks, I've had this overwhelming feeling that people are watching me, even when I'm alone. Sometimes I think I hear laughter or whispering, but when I look around, there's nobody there. It's really confusing, and it's starting to affect my daily life. My boss even asked if everything was okay because I seemed so on edge. It's weird because I've never experienced anything like this before, and it seemed to come out of nowhere.
For the past couple of weeks, I've been feeling really strange. I've been hearing things that I know aren't there, like whispers in my ears, but they're not very clear and they don't happen all the time. I find it hard to concentrate on my work or even have a conversation with someone. Sometimes, I feel like people can read my mind and that everyone is against me. My wife told me that I have been acting out of character lately, becoming irritable and snapping for no reason. The other day, while shopping, I thought I saw a shadowy figure following me, but when I turned around, there was no one there. It's not every day, but it's really starting to affect me.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed and overwhelmed. For the past two weeks, I've been hearing a distant voice calling out my name, but when I turn around, there's no one there. I'm also having a hard time concentrating at work and find myself feeling disconnected from my friends and family. I can't explain why this is happening to me, and it's quite distressing.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. Last week, I had a really stressful day at work and then things just got strange. For a couple of hours, I thought I was hearing my boss's voice outside my house. It turned out to be just my neighbor talking outside, but it felt so real at the time. Since then, I've been feeling paranoid, especially at work. I'm afraid my coworkers are talking behind my back and plotting against me. It's been hard to concentrate on my tasks because of the constant worry. It's been only a week, though, and I haven't experienced anything like this before.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit out of touch with reality. It started a few weeks ago after I lost my job. I feel so stressed and keep hearing voices in my head, but they are not too clear and don't bother me that much. Also, the other day, I was at the supermarket and suddenly felt like the walls were closing in on me, I got a little panicked and left the store. But, that only happened once, and I haven't experienced anything similar since then. My sleep hasn't been great, but I don't think I have any other symptoms. Is this something I should be concerned about?
Lately, I've been feeling really strange. I've had a few episodes where I feel incredibly paranoid and suspicious of everyone around me, but those feelings only last a few hours at most. When that happens, I also notice that my thoughts don't make much sense, like they're really disorganized. All of this started happening after I recently went through a stressful divorce. My sleep has been normal, and I don't use drugs. I've been feeling overwhelmed with work, but I've never had these symptoms before the divorce.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed and overwhelmed with work and family responsibilities. It has started affecting my sleep and I keep having these strange dreams that feel so real. The other day, I was absolutely convinced that my boss was trying to poison me, but then I realized it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Something similar happened a week ago, when I thought I heard my neighbor's voice in my head, but it turned out to be the TV in the next room. These experiences have been quite scary and are affecting my focus at work and my relationships with friends and family.
Ever since I started my new job a couple of months ago, I've been feeling really stressed out. This has led to a couple of instances where I felt extremely paranoid for a few minutes. I remember one time vividly: I was walking to my car after work, and suddenly felt like someone was following me, intending to harm me. I was terrified, almost to the point of not being able to move, but after a few minutes, the feeling subsided, and I couldn't find any evidence of anyone actually following me. This has happened maybe two other times, but the feelings go away pretty quickly.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed at work and it's been affecting my personal life as well. Last week, I thought I heard my dead grandmother telling me that I should quit my job and move to a different city. It was the strangest thing and it felt so real, but I brushed it off as it only happened once. I've never had any history of psychosis or schizophrenia in my family. However, I've been having difficulty focusing and have been feeling constantly on edge.
Lately, I've been having a really tough time at work and my personal life. It's been really overwhelming, and I have been feeling incredibly anxious and stressed. A few days ago, I had this strange experience where I felt like I was being watched, but I couldn't see anyone around me. It was really unsettling and it only lasted for a few minutes. It hasn't happened again since then, but that feeling still lingers in the back of my mind. I've also been having trouble sleeping, and my appetite has been off. I was wondering if you could offer some guidance or advice?
For the past week, I've been struggling with my thoughts. Sometimes I feel like I'm hearing voices in my head that aren't really there, but other times I'm fine and can think clearly. Yesterday, I got really paranoid in a crowded store, feeling like everyone was watching me and talking about me. I didn't sleep well last night because of the anxiety. But then today, I felt completely normal again, focused on my work, and didn't have any anxiety or paranoia. My mood shifts have been quite sudden and unpredictable. What's going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling like things are a bit off. I can't put my finger on exactly what is wrong. Just the other day, I was on my way to the grocery store, and I thought I saw my deceased grandmother just across the street. It was only for a split second, but it felt so real. That made me really anxious, and I found myself having a hard time focusing at work for the rest of the day. I've been having trouble sleeping at night because my mind just can't seem to slow down. Sometimes, I hear my name being called when there's nobody around, but it happens infrequently. I'm not sure what's going on, but it's making me feel really stressed.
Lately, I've been going through a tough time. A few weeks ago, I lost my job and since then, I've been feeling very stressed and anxious. Sometimes, I feel like people are conspiring against me, but these thoughts don't last long. I've also noticed that I talk to myself occasionally, but I'm always aware that it's just me talking to myself, you know? Apart from these, I've been feeling down and my sleep pattern has been disturbed. Can you help me understand what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling really out of it. I can't seem to focus on anything, and I'm always tired. Last week, I was convinced that my neighbor was spying on me. But then, I realized that it was just my imagination. I also thought I heard my mom's voice, even though she wasn't around. It's all really confusing and scary, and I don't know what's going on. I've never experienced anything like this before, but it hasn't happened every day since it started. Sometimes, I also struggle with my emotions - they're either really high or really low, and I can't control them.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit out of touch with reality. Last week, I was so convinced that my boss was plotting against me that I couldn't get any work done. Throughout the day, I kept seeing strange shadows and heard whispers, which was quite distracting. The thing is, these odd experiences only lasted for a couple of hours, and by the evening, I felt perfectly normal again. It was just that one day, although I did have a similar experience a few months ago.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed, especially at work. There was this one incident last week where I thought I heard someone calling my name outside my office, but when I went out, nobody was there. I've also felt a bit paranoid, like my coworkers might be talking about me behind my back. It's been affecting my sleep, and I've been feeling pretty anxious and irritable. I can't stop thinking that something bad is going to happen. I'm not sure if this is just work stress or something more serious.
Lately, I've been feeling a little disconnected from reality, especially when I'm alone at home. I thought I heard someone whispering my name last week, but I couldn't find anyone around. I've also had some trouble sleeping, often waking up around 3 AM. This has been going on for almost two weeks now. Two days ago, I saw something in the corner of my eye, but when I turned to look, there was nothing there. My friends say that I'm just being paranoid and that I might be stressed out because of my new job.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed at work and it's been weighing on me heavily. I just started a new job and I'm having a hard time adjusting to the pressure. The other day, I thought I heard my boss whispering about me in a negative way behind my back. I keep trying to brush it off, but this feeling of paranoia is creeping in. I can't tell if it's just my imagination or if it's really happening. I also have moments where I get really disorganized with my thoughts and kind of space out, but it doesn't last too long before I snap back to reality. Can you help me make sense of this?
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed. It all started when I lost my job and had to move back in with my parents. Sometimes, it feels like the pressure is too much to handle, and I hear distant voices talking about me, but when I try to focus on them, they disappear. These voices are not clear or frequent, but they make me feel anxious. Also, my sleep patterns have been really messed up, and I just can't focus on anything.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, and I'm not sure what's happening to me. Last week, I had this one strange experience where I thought I saw my deceased grandmother standing in my room, but it only lasted for a few seconds. Even though I feel a little stressed at work, overall, I'm handling things just fine. I haven't noticed any other unusual experiences or thoughts, but that brief moment with my grandmother has left me feeling anxious and uneasy.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. It all started a couple of weeks ago when I thought I heard someone whispering my name, but there was nobody around me. I brushed it off as my imagination playing tricks on me. Then, last week, I got this sudden feeling that everyone around me was plotting against me. I can't figure out why, but I just feel like they've all turned against me overnight. It's not constant, though. Some days I feel totally fine and don't have these thoughts or hear any whispers. I just don't know what's going on with me.
Lately, I've been feeling really on edge. I had this bizarre experience at work the other day when I thought I heard my boss talking about me in a really negative way, but when I asked him about it, he denied it. I can't help but feel like people are out to get me or talking about me behind my back. It's been causing me a lot of stress and I haven't been able to sleep well. In general, I don't think my mental state is as stable as it used to be.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. It started a few weeks ago when I thought I saw someone walking past my window, but when I looked again, there was nobody there. Maybe it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Then, two days ago, I was chatting with my friend and I suddenly had this weird sense that someone was listening in on our conversation. I can't help but feel paranoid and on edge, but there aren't any real reasons to think that someone is out to get me. Otherwise, my life has been pretty normal and I've not been under much stress.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. My friends tell me that I've been acting strange, but I don't see it. It happened after I lost my job last month, and since then, I've been struggling to keep up with my daily routine. I'm constantly feeling confused, but I can still understand and respond to most conversations. Sometimes, I feel like people are following me, but there's no real evidence of that. I haven't experienced any hallucinations or heard any voices. I'm just worried about my sudden change in behaviour and constant state of confusion.
Lately, I've been having a really hard time coping with my life. The stress at work and problems with my relationship are taking a toll on me. About a week ago, I had this weird experience where I thought that someone was watching me through my window, but when I looked, there was nobody there. This sense of paranoia hasn't really gone away, but it hasn't been accompanied by any other strange experiences or thoughts. It's making me feel uneasy and I'm having trouble focusing on my daily tasks.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. A few weeks ago, I experienced something really strange. It was like I was living in a movie, everything around me just didn't seem real. It only lasted a few hours, but it was terrifying. Since then, I've had moments when I can't tell if I'm dreaming or awake. I've also been feeling increasingly paranoid, like someone's watching me or there's some kind of conspiracy against me. My family thinks I'm just stressed, but I don't know. I've never felt like this before.
Lately, it's been kind of strange for me. I've been hearing my name being whispered, but there's no one around. It doesn't happen all the time, maybe a couple of times a week. The other day, I even thought I saw someone out of the corner of my eye, but when I turned to look, there was no one there. It was almost like a shadow just disappeared. I am also feeling really paranoid at times, like I'm being followed or watched by someone, but I'm not sure who or why. I don't understand why these things are happening to me, and it's starting to make me feel really anxious. It's been going on for about two months now.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed with work and family issues. Sometimes, I get this feeling like people are watching me or talking about me behind my back. It makes me uncomfortable, but I can usually shake it off after a little while. The other day, I was at the grocery store, and I thought I heard someone whisper my name, but when I turned around, no one was there. It was really unsettling. I've never experienced anything like this before.
Lately, I've been feeling quite stressed and overwhelmed at work. Last week, I had a strange experience where I heard my boss and coworkers talking about me in the break room, but when I checked, it turned out nobody was there. This happened once, and I haven't had any similar experiences since then. I also had difficulty sleeping that night, but I was able to bounce back on my normal sleep routine the following days. However, I feel like I'm constantly on alert, thinking someone might talk about me behind my back.
Lately, I've been going through a really tough time. My mom passed away a few weeks ago, and the grief has been overwhelming. Ever since that day, I've started hearing her voice in my head, but it's not like she's talking to me directly. It's more like I can hear her thoughts, and it feels so real. My friends tell me I've been acting strange since her funeral. I'm really having a tough time concentrating on my work and daily life. I just wonder if this is normal, or if there's something more going on.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. It started after I lost my job last month. I have been experiencing moments where I'm not sure what's real and what's not. The other day I saw a shadow in my peripheral vision, but when I turned to look, there was nothing there. These incidents usually happen at night, and they've been unsettling. I've also had moments where I zone out and lose track of time, like I'm in a trance. My sleep has been disturbed too, and my appetite is almost nonexistent. However, these symptoms seem to come and go, and I can still function in my daily life.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed at work, and I'm starting to feel quite overwhelmed. I noticed that I sometimes feel like I'm losing touch with reality. The other day, I thought I heard my boss calling my name from across the room, but he wasn't even there. This only happened once or twice, and it usually goes away when I focus on other things. I also feel a bit paranoid sometimes, like people are watching me and judging me for my mistakes. I know that these thoughts are not entirely true, but they make it difficult for me to handle my job. Can you help me understand what's going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling down and having a tough time concentrating on tasks. It's like my energy levels have dipped, and I feel more irritable than usual. My appetite has also decreased, and I've lost a bit of weight unintentionally. This has been going on for about two weeks, and it started after I lost my job. I can still get through my daily chores, and I do get better when I talk to my loved ones, but it's a challenge most of the time.

My energy levels have been really low, and I've noticed that I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. I don't really have any appetite, but I haven't really lost any significant weight, so I'm not sure if that's relevant. As for my mood, I just feel sad and hopeless. The strange thing is, I'm still able to function at work, but I just feel like I'm going through the motions.
Lately, I've been feeling down and having trouble concentrating. I don't have much energy, and I've been oversleeping. It's been going on for a few weeks now, but I haven't really lost interest in things I usually enjoy. It's just harder to get myself motivated lately. My appetite seems pretty much the same and I haven't noticed a significant weight change. I haven't had any thoughts of suicide or self-harm, but I am feeling a bit frustrated with myself.
Lately, I've been feeling down and just not myself. I lost my job a couple of months ago, and I've been struggling to find a new one. I don't feel like doing anything anymore, and I'm having trouble sleeping at night. I also find it hard to concentrate, and I've lost interest in spending time with my friends and family. I don't think I'm depressed, but I just don't know what to do to feel better.

Since then, I've been having trouble falling asleep, and I feel exhausted most of the time. I don't have much of an appetite, and I've lost a bit of weight too. My friends and family have noticed that I seem more irritable and short-tempered. They're worried about me. I've never felt like this before, and I'm not sure what to make of it. How can I get back to feeling like myself?

I mean, I still do some of the things I used to, like painting and hanging out with friends, but sometimes it feels like a chore. My appetite has decreased slightly, and I've lost a little bit of weight. I find it hard to concentrate on tasks at work, and I can't seem to catch a good night's sleep. Just the other day, a friend told me a funny story, and while I was able to laugh, I just didn't feel much joy in the moment. It's been about a month since I started to feel this way.
For the past few weeks, I've been feeling kind of down and lost interest in most of the things I used to enjoy. I've been struggling to get out of bed in the morning and can't seem to concentrate on anything. I've also noticed that I've been eating a little more than usual, but I don't think I've gained or lost a significant amount of weight. My sleep has been a bit off too, but it's not every single night. I've tried to brush off these symptoms, but I'm concerned because I just can't seem to shake these feelings.

I've also been having trouble concentrating at work, which is affecting my performance.

I would say all these have been going on for about two weeks now. Oh, and last week, my manager asked me if everything was okay because she noticed a slight drop in my productivity at work.

I've also found that I've been a bit more forgetful, but I think it's just because I'm tired. This situation at work has been stressful, and I'm not sure if these feelings are normal.

For the past month, I've been feeling quite down and unhappy. I find it difficult to concentrate on things, even simple tasks like reading a book. Sometimes, I can't sleep properly at night. I think about how my life has taken a wrong turn, and it's tough to find motivation for anything. My friends have noticed that I'm not as social as I used to be, but they think it's just a phase.

Lately, I've been feeling down more often than not. I find it hard to get excited about things I used to really enjoy.

Lately, I've been experiencing some strange things. I've had a few episodes where I get really moody, and my energy level fluctuates between being really high and really low. During those high energy periods, I am extremely productive and feel like I can do anything. But when my energy is low, I feel awful and can barely get out of bed. I also sometimes hear whispering voices when I'm all alone or see things that don't seem to be really there. The voices are not constant, but they bother me. Can you help me understand what's happening?

I'm worried this might be something serious.
Lately, I've been experiencing mood swings and difficulty concentrating. About two weeks ago, I was feeling extremely happy and full of energy, and I barely needed any sleep. I even tried to write a novel during that time. Last week, though, I suddenly felt really down and couldn't bring myself to do anything. On top of that, I often have trouble distinguishing between reality and my imagination. For example, the other day, I thought someone was talking to me from a distance, but there was no one around. I also had this strange feeling that I was being followed, even though I couldn't see anyone.

It's hard for me to stay motivated at work, and I've been withdrawing from my usual social activities. I've been sleeping a lot, too, like 10-12 hours a day. Could this be something more serious?
Lately, I've been feeling really off. I have these periods where I feel incredibly sad and hopeless, like everything's going wrong and it'll never get better. During these times, I struggle to concentrate on anything, and I don't see much point in trying anymore. But sometimes, I also feel really energetic and excited, like I can take on the world. However, at other times I feel like I hear voices talking to me or about me, even when no one is around. It's really confusing and I don't know what's happening.
Lately, I've been feeling really down and struggling to stay motivated. I keep having these moments of sadness, and it's affecting my daily life.

Lately, I've been feeling really down and experiencing mood swings. Sometimes I feel like I can barely get out of bed, while other times I'm full of energy and I can't sleep. I've had a few instances where I thought I could hear my neighbor talking about me, but when I asked them about it, they said they never said anything. Also, there have been a couple of times where I felt like I was receiving a special message from my favorite TV show, but my friends tell me that they didn't see the same thing. But this doesn't happen all the time, and I don't have any other symptoms. My job performance hasn't suffered too much and my relationships are still intact.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. Sometimes I hear voices when no one is around, but they're not persistent or constant. There are days when I'm extremely happy and outgoing, and other days when I feel really down and don't want to interact with anyone. These mood swings last for a few days, and then I'm back to normal. There was this one time when I thought my neighbor was plotting against me, but I realized it was just my imagination and that feeling went away after a while. Overall, I've been able to manage my daily life, though these experiences worry me.
Lately, I've been feeling really down and my emotions have been out of control. It's hard to explain, but sometimes, I feel like I hear whispering voices or see people that I know can't be there. These moments don't last long and go away quickly. But my mood swings have been really affecting my daily life. Some days, I'm overly excited about everything; and other days, I'm so depressed I can't even get out of bed. My work performance is suffering, and I've been getting into arguments with my family and friends. I'm worried about what's happening to me.
Lately, I've been feeling quite off. I can't seem to concentrate when I am at work or even while having a conversation with my friends. I've been hearing things which others can't, like someone whispering my name, but when I look around to see who it is, there's no one. It has been happening for about three weeks now, but it doesn't happen every single day. I've also been feeling quite low in the past couple of months. I just don't find interest or motivation in doing the things I used to love. My friends say that I've become very irritable and distant lately. I'm having trouble sleeping too, I either sleep too much or hardly at all.
Lately, I've been experiencing some strange feelings that have been affecting my daily life. It started a few months ago when I began to hear things when no one was around. At first, it was just whispers, but now the voices have become clearer and more persistent. They're there even when I'm alone, and I can't seem to escape them. I also have periods of feeling really down and disconnected from everything around me. These episodes can last for a week or two, and then they fade away, only to come back again later. I've started feeling paranoid as well, but it's not constant. It comes and goes with my mood changes. I'm trying to keep things under control, but it's getting harder and harder.
Lately, I have been feeling really down and it's affecting my daily life. I find it hard to concentrate on my work and I'm not enjoying the things I used to love. I also feel really tired all the time. I have these moments where I think people are talking about me and conspiring against me. It freaks me out, but it doesn't happen all the time, just occasionally. Sometimes I get distant from people, lost in my thoughts about what’s happening to me. Anyway, I have had no episodes of mania or hypomania. What could be the reason behind my situation?

However, these mood swings do not occur concurrently with the hallucinations and paranoia.
Lately, I've been feeling really down, it's almost like I'm losing interest in everything. I don't see the point of getting out of bed or hanging out with friends. This might have been going on for a month now. I do have some days where I feel better, but they don't last long. I've also been hearing things, like whispers in my head. I don't recognize them but they don't talk to me or anything. The whispers come and go, but they seem to be more present when I'm feeling low. I'm really confused about what's going on, and it's affecting my relationships and work.

I've also noticed that I've been feeling rather paranoid at times, thinking that people are watching or talking about me.

But these thoughts don't seem to last for more than a day or two. Additionally, I've been having trouble focusing on my work, and I start to lose my train of thought when talking to others.
Lately, I've been feeling like I'm not myself. Most days are a blur, and I struggle to remember what happened. I do recall some moments where I heard whispers, but they were not too clear or frequent. It feels like I'm living in a fog, detached from reality. My social life is suffering as well; I find it difficult to connect with my friends and family. The other day, I was at my sister's birthday party and found it exhausting to engage in conversations.

In the past month, I had a break-up, and I can't shake the feeling that there's a hidden meaning behind it.

My sleep pattern is also really messed up, sometimes I can't sleep but at other times, I just sleep through the whole day. I've been hearing voices that aren't there, and they're whispering things to me. It happens quite often, but it gets really intense when I'm feeling extra sad or manic. I also miss my best friend; she moved away a few months ago, and since then, I haven't been as social as I was before.
Lately things have been really tough for me. I've had a lot of mood swings, and I've been feeling sad and down most of the time.

I've also been hearing voices occasionally, but they don't seem too intense and they're not always present. I'm finding it hard to focus on work, and I'm so tired of feeling this way. It's really affecting my relationships and my life.
Lately, I've been feeling pretty down and it's affecting my daily life. I wouldn't say it's constant, but it comes and goes.

I've also been hearing voices in my head, but they don't seem to be commanding me to do anything, just snide comments and minor whispering. To make a story out of it, it's like I keep pushing away the activities I previously enjoyed and withdrawing from friendships. The whispers in my head isolate me even more.
Lately, my life feels a bit out of control. I'm having trouble concentrating at work and feel constantly on edge. Sometimes I hear voices in my head that aren't really there, but it's not too frequent, maybe once a week. And these voices are not that scary or anything. They just say random things like the color of a car, and then they stop. I also feel a little down for no apparent reason, but this doesn't happen all the time – it usually only lasts a day or two, and then I feel back to normal. It's confusing, and I'm not sure what's going on.

I feel extremely sad for a few days, and then suddenly I'm super energetic and can't sleep at all. It's like I'm on a rollercoaster. Last week, I went on a solo road trip out of the blue, leaving my job and family behind without notice. It was fun, but when I came back, I realized it was a reckless decision. These symptoms come and go and have been happening for about three months now.

I've also been having trouble concentrating and organizing my thoughts, especially when I'm under stress. But most of the time, I can still do the things that I need to do each day.

Lately, I've been feeling like people are constantly watching and following me. I can't seem to shake the feeling that they're out to sabotage my life and career. Sometimes, I find myself confronting them and accusing them of their intentions. My partner says it's all in my head, but I can't stop thinking about it. But it doesn't affect my daily life too much, and I'm able to work and maintain relationships. It's just this constant nagging feeling that I can't shake.
Lately, I've been feeling like my neighbors are always watching me. I can't shake the feeling that they're trying to control my life, and it's starting to affect my daily activities. I've even noticed that I've been avoiding going outside just to avoid the possibility of them monitoring me. However, I know this isn't normal, and sometimes I realize that it's probably just my imagination. But still, there are moments when I feel completely paranoid.
Lately, I've been feeling like people are watching me and talking about me behind my back. I can't shake off this feeling, even though my friends tell me it's not true. I think I overheard my coworkers discussing my personal life, and it's making me really uncomfortable. It all started a few months back when I moved into my new apartment. I just don't feel safe anymore.
Lately, I've been having this strong feeling that someone is following me all the time. I can't exactly describe it, but it definitely makes me feel uneasy. The other day, I was at the grocery store, and I saw this person in a baseball cap, and I just knew they were spying on me. I've noticed that this feeling gets worse when I'm stressed or haven't slept well.
Lately, I've been having these thoughts that my coworkers are plotting against me. I can't shake the feeling, and it's been affecting my work and relationships with them. I don't have any concrete evidence, but the way they talk and act around me makes me think they're trying to sabotage my projects. It's been going on for a couple of months now, but I can't say for sure if this has always been the case. Other than that, my life is pretty normal and I don't have any other unusual experiences or thoughts.
Lately, I've been experiencing some really strange thoughts. For the past two months, I started to believe that I'm being followed by someone. It all started one day when I noticed that a car was parked outside my house and I felt like someone was watching me. Since then, I constantly feel like someone's following me; I see different cars and sometimes the same one. But when I mention it to my friends, they say that it's nothing to worry about. They think that my mind is playing tricks on me but I have this strong feeling that I'm being followed. Other than that, my life seems to be going okay, just the usual daily routine and work activities.
Lately, I've been struggling with some thoughts that have been consuming me. I have this belief that my neighbors are constantly spying on me. I feel like they're monitoring my every move through hidden cameras, even though I haven't found any evidence of this. It's gotten to the point where I'm scared to leave my house or even look outside. Sometimes, I question whether this belief is true or not, but I can't shake it. It doesn't seem to impact other aspects of my life, like my job or relationships, but it's driving me crazy. Can you help me?
Lately, I've been feeling like my coworkers are plotting against me. They seem distant, and I'm sure they're talking about me behind my back. I've even noticed certain co-workers whispering and giving me nasty looks. Sometimes, I think they try to sabotage my work so that I lose my job. All this started after I got a promotion and my work-life balance has been completely disrupted. Am I just being paranoid, or is there something more going on?
Lately, I've been feeling like my co-workers are plotting against me. I think they're trying to sabotage my work and turn the boss against me. This idea keeps me up at night, and I'm constantly worried about their next move. I try to keep my distance from them and collect evidence to prove their intentions, but I can't really find anything solid. A few days ago, I heard them talking about something in a hushed tone, but when I approached they changed the topic. I don't feel physically threatened, but I'm completely on edge at work. What should I do?
Lately, I've been feeling very down and low on energy. I've been staying in bed most of the day and have lost interest in my hobbies. These episodes last for about a week. Then, I'll suddenly feel so much better for a few days. During those times, I feel very optimistic, talking enthusiastically and showing lots of energy. But these 'up' episodes only last for 2-3 days. Is there something wrong with me?
For the past few months, I've been feeling really down. I just can't seem to shake off this gloomy feeling. Sometimes I feel okay for a couple of days, but then I'm back to feeling low. I've also noticed that my sleep patterns have become irregular. A few months ago, I stopped hanging out with my friends because I just didn't feel like it. I have trouble concentrating on my work and I feel like everything I do is pointless. There are moments when I feel elated and super energetic, but those moments don't last very long. Is this something I should be worried about?
Lately, I've been experiencing these periods where I feel really down and uninterested in pretty much anything. During those times, I often have trouble concentrating, and I struggle to get out of bed. These low periods usually last for about a week or so before they eventually pass. Then I'll feel 'normal' for a few days, but sometimes I have periods where I feel highly energized and motivated. However, these periods are not as intense or as long-lasting as the low ones. I don't end up doing anything reckless or spending hours on end feeling invincible.
Lately, I've been feeling really down and demotivated. There are days when I struggle to get out of bed and just wish I could sleep to escape my thoughts. But then there are also days where I feel extremely energetic and talkative, like I can take on the world. It's so confusing because these happy days don't last as long, and I go right back into my sad state. A few years ago, I had a terrible depressive episode that lasted for months. I was prescribed antidepressants, and they've helped, but my mood swings still persist. I'm worried because these mood changes are affecting my relationships, work, and overall well-being.
For the past few months, I've been experiencing some unusual mood swings. There are times when I feel really happy, excited, and energetic, but it doesn't last long and is not severe or extreme. I can still function normally and carry on with my daily activities without any problems. However, there are also times when I feel low and depressed, but I can still get myself out of bed and go to work. I noticed my sleep has been affected too. Sometimes, I wake up early in the morning and can't go back to sleep, and other times, I feel like sleeping all day. My mood shifts don't seem to follow any pattern, and I can't figure out what's triggering them.
Lately, I've been going through some emotional ups and downs. About a month ago, I was feeling really good and confident about myself, like I could conquer the world. It lasted for a week or so, but it seemed like the normal happiness that comes with good things happening in my life. After that, I started feeling a bit sad and tired, but I wouldn't say it was extreme or anything. It's just that I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy, like my hobbies and socializing. I've been having trouble sleeping too, but I'm not sure if it's connected.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. There are times when I have a lot of energy and feel really good about everything. I've been staying up super late and getting a lot of things done, like cleaning the house or working on my projects. It's like I just can't stop. Then, there are times when I just feel really down. I feel hopeless, like I can't see the point in anything. I've noticed this has been going on for a few months now. What's strange is that these mood changes aren't lasting very long. These ups and downs can happen within the same day sometimes. I've talked to a friend about it, and she mentioned something called bipolar disorder. What do you think?
Lately, I've been going through a tough time. I feel like my mood has been swinging from really low to just a little better. When I'm in a low mood, I just can't get out of bed and I lose interest in everything. I can't focus or enjoy things that I usually like, and sometimes I feel like a burden to my family and friends. Then, a day or two later, I suddenly feel much better. I feel more productive at work and start to enjoy things again. I don't feel like I'm on top of the world or anything, but I definitely feel like I have more energy and motivation. Recently, I found that these mood swings are making it hard for my relationships and keeping up with my responsibilities. Can you please help me understand what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. Sometimes, I feel incredibly happy and energetic, but it doesn't last too long, maybe a couple of days. During that time, I might talk a lot more and have a bunch of ideas. After that, I start to feel down and lose interest in things that I previously enjoyed. I feel really tired and have trouble sleeping, but I can still manage to go to work and maintain my relationships. This pattern has been happening for the past several months, and I'm not sure what to do.
For the past few years, I've been experiencing mood swings like being really happy and energetic for a few days, and then suddenly feeling down and sad. These mood changes don't last very long, maybe a couple days at most, and they don't interfere with my daily life. Recently, I went through a breakup and started feeling more depressed for an extended period, like a few weeks. But I never have any suicidal thoughts or self-harm urges.
Lately, I've been having these mood swings where I feel overly excited and super productive, but they don't last very long - maybe a day or two. During these moments, I'm full of ideas and energy, but I find it difficult to focus, and I can be quite impulsive. On the flip side, I have periods where I feel down and experience prolonged sadness, lasting for weeks or even months. When I'm depressed, I have trouble concentrating and I find myself isolating from my friends and family. I always get back on track eventually, but I'm worried about how these mood changes are affecting my life. Can you help me?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit down, but it's not too severe. It's been about two weeks now, and sometimes I feel pretty okay, but other times I feel low and have no motivation. I've also noticed I've been a bit irritable. Last year, there was a period where I felt really upbeat and energetic for about a week, but it didn't cause any problems in my life. Is this something I should be worried about?
Lately, I've been feeling really down and unmotivated, like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster. A few weeks ago, I was so excited about life and had a ton of energy to get things done. But now, I just feel sad and like I can't get out of bed. I've been sleeping a lot more than usual, too. I only started to feel this way after a big change happened in my life, and don't really remember ever having these ups and downs before.
Lately, I've been feeling really down, like there's no hope. I have a history of feeling down for extended periods, but this one seems worse than before. I also have moments where I feel extremely happy and motivated, but they rarely last for more than a few hours. Just last week, I felt so exhilarated that I decided to finish a whole project in one night, only to lose that motivation the next morning. I'm not sure how to deal with these ups and downs, but they are impacting my daily life and relationships.
Lately, I've been going through some mood swings. A few weeks ago, I was feeling really low and unmotivated; I couldn't focus on work and hardly felt like doing anything at all. I was just feeling down all the time, and it lasted for about a week and a half. Then, suddenly, everything changed, and I felt like I was on top of the world. My energy levels were through the roof, and I was getting so much done. But then, after a few days, I crashed again and felt even worse than before. When I'm feeling good, it's great, but when I'm down, it's unbearable. It's like I can't even predict how I'll be feeling in a couple of hours.
Lately, I've been noticing some changes in my mood. For a few days, I feel really energetic, confident, and extremely productive. It feels like I can conquer the world, but it doesn't last long. Usually, it is followed by a period of a week or so where I feel quite low. During those times, I don't even want to talk to anyone, and nothing interests me. I find it really hard to concentrate on my work too. This has happened a couple of times in the past month, and it's getting in the way of my personal and professional life. What can I do to manage these mood swings?
Lately, I've been experiencing these uncontrollable highs and lows in my mood. When I'm feeling high, I become very energetic, but my family says I'm irritable and overly-talkative. It doesn't last long though, just a couple of days at most. Then, there are days when I feel so low that I don't want to get out of bed. These periods have been happening more frequently, and I'm starting to worry. My work has been affected, and I'm having difficulty concentrating. But I haven't had any thoughts of harming myself or others.
Lately, I've been feeling quite low and having trouble finding motivation to get out of bed. It's been going on for two weeks now. Before that, I had a week of intense energy and felt really creative and inspired. However, people around me felt like my behavior was a bit erratic. This cycle of ups and downs seems to be recurring in my life. My best friend told me that I didn't feel depressed during the high energy phase, but instead I was irritably snapping at everyone. The frequent mood swings are making things difficult for me both at work and in my personal relationships.
Ever since I went off to college, I've been experiencing some mood changes. I have this period where I'm, like, really excited about everything and I hardly even need to sleep. I can get so much done during these times. But then, I feel like I crash and get really low. I have a hard time getting out of bed, and I feel completely unmotivated. I lose interest in things I usually enjoy. The episodes usually last for a few days, sometimes up to two weeks, but they've never felt too extreme. It's a cycle, but it's not really affecting my daily life that much. Is it possible I could have Bipolar II Disorder?
Lately, I've been feeling really down and lacking energy. I can barely get out of bed and do anything productive. It's been happening on and off for a few weeks now. However, I do remember a phase last year where I felt super energized and productive, but it didn't last too long. I'm concerned about these mood swings, and I don't know how to handle them. Can you help me understand what's happening?
Lately, I've been experiencing mood swings that are affecting my daily life. Sometimes, I feel extremely energetic and productive, like I can conquer the world. Other times, I feel extremely down and hopeless, finding it difficult to even get out of bed. These episodes can last anywhere from a few hours to a week or two. I'm not sure what's causing it, but it's really causing strain on my relationships and work. A friend suggested that it might be Bipolar II, but I don't know if my symptoms fully fit the criteria.
Lately, my emotions have been all over the place. I have days where I feel extremely happy, productive, and full of energy, followed by days where I struggle to get out of bed and feel really low. Sometimes, I feel like I could conquer the world, and then other days, I can barely find the motivation to do anything. During my high energy days, I tend to make impulsive decisions but never do anything dangerous or life-threatening. I've noticed a pattern where my mood shifts every few weeks or so.
For the past few months, I've been experiencing fluctuations in my mood. I have periods of feeling really down and losing interest in things I usually enjoy, but these never last more than a few days. Recently, I had a week where I felt overly energetic and optimistic, like I could do anything, but I didn't really engage in risky behaviors or feel out of control. It was just an unusually good mood. I mentioned this to a friend, and she suggested I talk to a professional. Do you think there's a reason to be concerned?
Lately, I've been feeling a lot of ups and downs. I had this one week where I was full of energy, extremely motivated, and got so much done. I barely needed any sleep, and I was very talkative. But then, for the past few weeks, I've been feeling quite low. I've lost interest in things I usually enjoy, and I've had trouble focusing on my work. My sleep has been all over the place, and my appetite has decreased. I'm not sure if this is a big deal or just a phase I'm going through.
Lately, I've been feeling really down and unmotivated. It's been hard for me to concentrate at work, and I can't seem to find the energy to do anything. This past weekend, I spent the entire time in bed and didn't even leave my house. A few weeks ago, though, I felt on top of the world. I had so much energy that I stayed up all night organizing my house and catching up on projects. But then I crashed again, and I've been feeling terrible ever since. It feels as if my mood is swinging back and forth uncontrollably. What can you make of this?
Lately, my mood has been all over the place. A couple of weeks ago, I felt on top of the world. I was full of energy, very creative and confident, and I couldn't sleep because my mind was racing with ideas. This lasted for a few days, then I crashed. For the past week, I've been feeling really down, like I have no energy or motivation, and I just want to sleep all the time. It's been affecting my work, but overall, I can still get through the day. I'm confused because I've never experienced this kind of mood swings before. What's going on with me?
Lately, I've been experiencing some ups and downs in my mood. It's not a constant change, but every couple of weeks, I get really excited about everything, like I can conquer the world. It lasts for a few days, and then I get back to normal. I don't have any trouble sleeping during these moments; in fact, I think I sleep even better. On the other hand, last month, I went through a terrible week where I felt so down and hopeless. I didn't want to get out of bed and had no energy for anything. It never happened before, and I don't know why I felt that way.
Lately, I have been feeling quite down and sad most days, but not to the point of having major depressive episodes. Occasionally, I have periods of high energy, feeling overly productive and talkative, but it only lasts for a day or two. I'm usually able to function normally despite these mood swings, and they haven't caused me any significant stress. But I'm worried that these feelings might evolve into something more serious. Can you shed some light on what might be happening to me?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. Some days I wake up full of energy and excitement, but then there are days when I just don't want to get out of bed and have no interest in doing anything. Occasionally, I get so excited about a project that I can't sleep, and I feel like I can conquer the world. But after a few days, I lose all motivation, and the project remains unfinished. During my down days, I feel like I'm drowning in sadness, but it's usually not bad enough that I can't function at work or home. People around me have noticed my mood swings and are starting to get concerned.
Lately, I've been feeling quite low and unmotivated. I don't enjoy the things I used to, and I'm constantly tired. Although I've had a few days here and there when I felt really good and energetic, they were not as intense or long-lasting as the low periods. I find it hard to concentrate, and my appetite has changed. Additionally, I'm experiencing some trouble sleeping. This has been going on for a couple of months now, and I'm getting worried. It started when I lost my job and had to move back in with my parents.
Lately, I've been feeling really down and it's been hard for me to find motivation to do anything. Sometimes I stay in bed all day and cry. But then there are other days when I feel really good, like I can conquer the world. I come up with all these big ideas and start a million projects, but I never seem to finish any of them. It's like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster. My sleep varies too - sometimes I sleep too much and other times I hardly sleep at all. All of this started after I got fired from my job last month. I just don't know how to handle my emotions.
Lately, I've been going through some ups and downs. I have these periods of feeling really great and energetic, where I'm more social and productive than usual but I don't think it's affecting my life negatively. However, I also experience these low moments where I feel sad, hopeless, and just have no motivation to do anything. It's not like I've been having trouble at work or school, but it's been affecting my overall mood. My sleep is sometimes a bit disturbed, but nothing too extreme. I just don't know what is going on with me.
Lately, I've been feeling really down and unmotivated. I don't have the energy to do anything, and I just feel worthless most of the time. But then, there are days when I suddenly feel super energetic and like I can accomplish anything. It's strange, cause last week during one of those high energy days, I decided to start painting my entire house by myself. I was up all night doing it, and I even convinced my friends to help me. But then, the next day, I couldn't even get out of bed. I feel like I'm on an emotional roller coaster, and I can't seem to find stability.
For the past few months, I've noticed that I have periods of feeling really low and lethargic, like I don't want to get out of bed. During these times, I lose interest in things I usually enjoy, and I feel hopeless and overwhelmed. However, these episodes are followed by times when I feel really good, full of energy and motivation. I can stay up all night working on projects and get a lot done. But my friends told me that my behavior is reckless, and I easily make impulsive decisions when I'm in this state. These mood swings happen every now and then, maybe several weeks in between.
Lately, I've been feeling really down and hopeless. It seems like I can't find joy in the things I used to enjoy, and my energy level is very low. I don't think I'm experiencing extreme mood swings, but I do have moments when I feel relatively better, like I can handle life. These moments, however, never last long, and then I'm back to feeling down again. I've also had trouble sleeping, and I just find it hard to focus on tasks. My friends and family have noticed that I seem to be less social than I used to be.
Lately, I've been feeling really down and uninterested in the things I used to enjoy. My energy and motivation are pretty low too. I've had a couple of episodes like this in the past year, but they haven't lasted more than a week or two at a time. Sometimes, I feel better and my mood lifts a little, but it's never to the point where I have tons of energy or feel extremely happy. My friends did mention that I seemed more outgoing and talkative during a party last month, but that's about it.
Lately, I've been feeling really down and unmotivated. It's been going on for a couple of weeks, and I just can't seem to get out of this funk. I don't feel like it's severe depression, but it's definitely affecting my life. There was a time, about two months ago, when I felt incredibly energized and productive. I was super excited about my life and felt like I could accomplish anything. However, that energy eventually faded, and I returned to my normal, balanced self. I'm worried that this low mood might become a more significant issue. Can you help me understand what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling so much stress and it's affecting my daily life. There are moments when I feel really happy and full of energy, but they don't last more than a few hours at most. It's strange because I'll feel really good and then suddenly, I'll feel sad and hopeless for no apparent reason. This up and down cycle has been going on for a couple of months now, and it's really frustrating. Sometimes, I find it difficult to sleep, but once I fall asleep, I almost don't want to wake up. My appetite has also decreased, and I haven't been eating well.
Lately, I've been feeling really down, like I've lost interest in my hobbies and hanging out with my friends. It's been going on for maybe a couple of weeks now. I've also been feeling really tired and often have trouble sleeping. However, I can't say I've ever felt euphoric or extremely high energy. My mood generally stays pretty low. Last month, for a few days, I did feel somewhat more productive and engaged with my work, but it wasn't extreme, and it didn't last very long.
Lately, I've been feeling really emotional and my mood seems to be all over the place. There are days when I feel extremely productive, happy, and full of energy, but then I also have days where I feel down and just don't want to do anything. However, the happy days don't seem too excessive, and sometimes, when I'm feeling low, I can still do some tasks and hang out with my friends. Last month, my friends and I went on a camping trip and I was really struggling with feeling low, but I still went and had some good moments during the trip. Can you help me understand what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling really strange. My friends say that I've been acting differently. I don't even recognize myself in the mirror sometimes. I sometimes hear my name being called when no one is actually calling me, and my thoughts have been racing a lot. I just can't seem to focus on anything. I've also been feeling really paranoid, like people are out to get me. This has been going on for a month now.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. I feel like people are watching me and talking about me behind my back. Sometimes I hear them whispering, but when I look around, there doesn't seem to be anyone there. I'm also having these vivid dreams that feel so real, and they're really bothering me because I can't tell if they actually happened or not. This has been going on for about a week now, and it's affecting my daily life. I can't focus at work, and I feel paranoid even when I'm with my friends. It's so weird, but I can't shake this feeling of being watched and talked about. Do you have any ideas about what might be going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything going on in my life. I've been hearing things that aren't really there, like whispers and someone calling my name, but it's not happening all the time, just occasionally. I also find myself getting a bit disorganized, but I wouldn't say I'm completely disorganized. Sometimes, I just feel disconnected with what is happening around me. I've been like this for a couple of weeks now. My parents said that I've been acting differently, but I don't know, maybe I'm just overreacting? Can you help me with this?
Lately, I've been feeling really strange, like I'm going crazy or something. I have had a few instances where I felt disconnected from reality, but it hasn't really affected my overall life yet. About a month ago, I started hearing voices in my head, and they usually speak in the evening when I'm alone. I've also noticed that I have a hard time focusing and my thoughts can be quite disorganized, but I usually manage to keep up with everything. My family is a bit worried, but they think it's just stress from work. I'm not sure what to do; it feels so bizarre.
Lately, I've been feeling weird. I can't really focus on anything, and I noticed that I've been seeing things that aren't there. I was walking down the street last week, and I swear I saw my best friend from high school, but when I called out to her, she vanished. It's freaked me out, but it's only happened once. I do tend to get really confused sometimes, when I'm talking to people, I feel like their words are just jumbled and not making sense. But I still manage to go to work and take care my daily tasks. Should I be worried?
Lately, I've been feeling really off. I've been having trouble sleeping, and when I do, I have these vivid dreams that feel so real. A few times, it feels like my senses are heightened, and I hear things that aren't really there, but it's not constant. I've also noticed my thoughts have been all over the place and I have difficulty paying attention to one thing for very long. Sometimes, I find it hard to interact with people because it feels like there's a disconnect between my thoughts and what I'm able to say.
Lately, I've been feeling extra stressed and anxious. Sometimes I feel like people are watching me or talking about me, but I can't be sure. Also, I've been having trouble concentrating and my thoughts seem scattered. This started about three weeks ago when I was let go from my job. I've been keeping up with school and daily activities just fine, but I find myself feeling paranoid and uneasy around people.
Lately, I've been struggling with a strange feeling that my thoughts are being taken over by someone else. It's kind of hard to explain, but I feel like I'm being controlled by an external force. I'm also feeling a bit detached from my family and friends, and I can't seem to focus on my work. Sometimes I think I can hear people talking about me, but when I look around there's nobody there. This has been going on for about two weeks now.
Lately, I've been feeling quite off. I've been having strange thoughts, like I'm being watched or that someone is plotting against me. It's been going on for a few weeks now, and it's starting to affect my daily life. I find it hard to focus on work or enjoy time with my friends and family. Sometimes, I think I hear whispers, but then I realize it's just my imagination. I haven't experienced any disorganized speech or catatonic behavior, though.
Lately, I've been feeling kind of off. I've been hearing some strange noises like whispers and footsteps, but no one else seems to hear them. My friends and family have also noticed that I'm acting a bit weird and withdrawn. I've been having trouble concentrating even though I used to be so productive. The other day, I had this bizarre dream where I was being followed by shadows, but I know it was just a dream. It may be just my stress, but I thought I should talk to somebody about it.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I've been hearing whispers when I'm alone, and it's freaking me out. At first, I thought maybe it was just the wind or an appliance humming, but it's getting more frequent. I also get this intense feeling that someone is watching me, but I'm not sure who. I was laid off from my job a few weeks ago, and since then, I've been struggling to find motivation to do anything. My friends say they haven't seen any significant changes in my behavior, but these experiences have only been happening for about a month. Could you help me understand what's happening to me?
I've been feeling really off lately. I feel like some people at my workplace are talking behind my back and sometimes it's like I can almost hear them whispering. My friend told me about their experience with schizophrenia, and it made me worry if I might be experiencing something similar. But it's not like I'm hearing voices or anything, just a sense of people whispering. Also, I've been feeling a bit disconnected from my friends and family, and sometimes I find it difficult to stay focused during conversations. This has been going on for about a month now.
Hi, I've been feeling a bit out of sorts over the past few weeks. I've been hearing whispers sometimes when I'm all alone at home, but the sounds are usually muffled, and I can't make out what they're saying. I've also started to feel like I'm struggling more than usual with focusing on my work and even with daily tasks. Just last week, my boss called a team meeting, and I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation. I've also been feeling pretty low and withdrawn lately, preferring to stay in my room rather than hang out with my friends. I don't know what's going on with me; it's never been like this before.
Lately, I've been experiencing some unusual things. I often hear whispers in my head when I'm alone, but they aren't clear enough for me to understand what they are saying. I also sometimes believe that people around me are conspiring against me, but it doesn't happen all the time. Once, I even thought I saw someone following me, but when I turned around, there was no one there. I'm also struggling to concentrate on tasks, and I find it hard to maintain relationships with people. I'm not sure what's going on, but it's starting to interfere with my daily life.
I've been feeling really out of it recently, like I don't know what's happening around me. I thought I was hearing voices talking to me, but it was just someone from the other room. I feel like I'm losing my motivation to do things, and my family is worried about me. My sleep schedule has been all over the place in the past month, and I've lost touch with some of my friends. I've started to feel detached from my own emotions too. Does this mean I'm losing my mind?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I've had a few instances where I thought I heard someone call my name, but no one was there. I've also been having trouble focusing at work, and my performance has been suffering. I've started becoming more withdrawn and isolated, especially because I'm embarrassed about these experiences. My mood has been low, but I'm not experiencing any delusions or hallucinations. Can you help me understand what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed and stressed. I've started to feel like people are talking about me behind my back, even if I don't have any concrete evidence of it. Sometimes, I feel really anxious and have trouble concentrating on tasks. I've also noticed that my sleep has been disturbed for the past few weeks. To be honest, last week, I thought I heard someone whisper my name, but when I turned around, there was nobody there. I'm worried that something might be wrong with me.
Lately, I've been feeling like things are just not making sense. I'm constantly suspicious of people around me, even my close friends. I find it hard to trust anyone, and I think someone might be out to get me. I also keep hearing voices in my head that aren't there. They keep telling me to do things, and sometimes I feel like I'm losing control. However, this has only been going on for about three weeks. I've been feeling quite depressed, and it's affecting my work and relationships. Can you help me understand what's happening?
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed and anxious. I'm constantly worried about my work and family. Sometimes I think people are talking about me behind my back, but when I confront them, they say that they weren't. I also have trouble sleeping and my appetite has decreased significantly. I've lost interest in my hobbies and activities and I feel like I'm in a constant state of despair. Can you help me?
Lately, I've been experiencing some odd thoughts and feelings. I feel like people are watching me all the time and conspiring against me. I’ve also been feeling really disconnected from my friends and family, like they’re just not on the same wavelength as me anymore. This has been going on for about 2 weeks now, but I haven't experienced any hallucinations or disorganized speech. I'm just feeling very paranoid and distant from others.
For the past few weeks, I've been feeling really disconnected from my life. It's strange, but I feel like my thoughts aren't making much sense and my emotions have become erratic. I have trouble staying focused on tasks, and sometimes I can't help but laugh or take something way too seriously. The other day, I went to the movies, and I got this overwhelming feeling that the actors were talking specifically to me. It was really unsettling, and I don't know what's going on.
Lately, I've been feeling really disconnected from the world and it's hard for me to relate to people. There are these strange noises, like whispers or footsteps, that nobody else seems to hear, but I do. My daily routine has become a struggle. I lost weight, and sometimes I just don't feel like eating. I don't feel any excitement when I meet my friends, and it's hard to focus on anything. My thoughts feel scattered, making it difficult for me to express myself. My family is worried about me and I don't know what's wrong.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I can't seem to concentrate on anything, and I've been feeling slightly anxious. However, I haven't noticed any major changes in my behavior or thought patterns. Just the other day, I was talking to my friend about a movie we watched, and I found it difficult to focus on the conversation. I feel like my sleep is also affected, but I can't determine if it's just a temporary thing or something more serious. Sometimes, I get paranoid that people are talking about me behind my back, but I feel like that could just be me overthinking things.
Ever since my friend moved away about 5 months ago, I've been feeling really off. I hear his voice so vividly sometimes, like he's still here with me. But it's not like I'm having full-blown conversations with him or anything, it's just fleeting moments. Sometimes, I also get these strong feelings that people around me are watching me and talking about me behind my back. It's not all the time, but it's enough to make me feel anxious and paranoid. I've been trying to focus on work, but it's been tough. I just keep feeling disconnected and spaced out. It's all really confusing to me. 
Lately, I've been feeling really off. I've been having some strange thoughts, and I often find it hard to concentrate on things. A couple of weeks ago, I thought I saw someone following me, but when I turned to confront them, there was nobody there. This has happened a few times now, but it's not every day. Although I feel a bit detached, I still manage to maintain relationships with my friends and family. My sleep is affected, and I get anxious sometimes, but it's not severe.
Lately, I've been feeling a little off. It's hard to explain, but it's like I sometimes hear faint whispers when I'm alone, but when I try to focus on them, they're gone. I've been feeling emotionally disconnected from my family and friends, and I've started avoiding social situations. I also struggle with making decisions as if my thoughts are foggy. However, these symptoms aren't persistent and only happen occasionally. Is there something wrong with me?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I can't really explain it, but I've been feeling like people are watching me all the time, and it's freaking me out. It started about a month ago, and it's been getting worse. Sometimes I think I hear voices in my head, but they go away when someone else is around. I'm getting really paranoid, and it's making it hard for me to concentrate on anything. Also, I don't want to sound crazy, but last week I thought my dog was talking to me, but it only happened once. I'm scared to tell anyone because they might think I'm losing it.
Lately, I've been feeling like things are not real. I was at my sister's birthday party last week, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just dreaming or watching it from a distance. I've been having trouble sleeping and sometimes feel agitated for no reason. Also, I've noticed that I sometimes zone out and lose track of time. I try to tell myself that it's just stress, but I can't help but wonder if there's something more going on.
Lately, I've been feeling really off. I can't quite focus and some days it feels like my thoughts are racing. I've even begun to see things that aren't there, but it's not too bad - it's usually just at night. My friends have noticed that I'm not as social as I used to be and that I seem uninterested in things I used to love. I'm just really tired all the time and kind of forgetful. I don't have any history of mental illness in my family. And as for my work, I've been managing to perform well despite these issues.
For the past few weeks, I've been having a really tough time. Sometimes I feel like I can't concentrate on anything and I lose track of what I'm trying to say in the middle of a conversation. It's frustrating to me and it seems to bother others too. I’ve also noticed that I'm having trouble sleeping and when I do sleep, I have the most vivid and disturbing dreams. I’ve been feeling somewhat detached from reality as well. Last week, I thought I heard someone calling my name, but when I looked around there was no one there. It really freaked me out. My friends say that lately, I'm behaving in a bizarre way, but I don't really know what they mean. My mood has been fluctuating a lot recently too, but most of the time I feel uneasy and a bit stressed.
Lately, I've been feeling really off, you know? I've been having these weird experiences where I feel like I'm being watched, even when I'm alone. Sometimes, I hear voices whispering in the background, but I can't really comprehend what they're saying, and I'm not sure if they're even real. I've also been a little paranoid about my close friends and family, feeling like they're plotting something against me. This has been going on for about a month now, but I can function normally most of the time.
Lately, I've been feeling really strange. I sometimes hear voices that aren't there, but it only happens a few times a month. The voices don't say anything serious, just random chatters. I'm also quite moody and sometimes find it hard to communicate with others. Last week, I had a hard time making sense of what people were saying and it got me a bit confused. There was also this incident where I suddenly felt paranoid that someone was out to get me, but that feeling disappeared after a couple of hours. Do you have any thoughts on what's going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling really off. I guess it started a few weeks ago when I just couldn't concentrate on anything and felt like my thoughts were racing. I've been having some trouble sleeping too. My friends tell me that I've been acting a bit strange, like talking to myself sometimes or just zoning out. One time, I even thought I heard my dog talking to me, but it only happened that once and hasn't happened since. I'm worried that something might be really wrong with me. Can you help?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit strange. I often feel confused and find it difficult to concentrate on tasks, and have been having trouble sleeping. Sometimes, I hear things that aren't actually there, like soft whispers or footsteps in an empty room, but it's not very frequent or intense. Additionally, I've noticed that I'm becoming more socially withdrawn and have lost interest in some of my previous hobbies. This has been going on for the past month or so.
Lately, I've been struggling with some issues and I don't know what to make of them. For the past couple of months, I've been feeling like I can't trust people who were once close to me. I overheard some of my friends talking behind my back, but when I confronted them, they denied it. Sometimes, I find myself lost in my own thoughts, and I can't focus on anything for a long period of time. For example, I'll be watching TV and suddenly realize that I have no idea what's going on in the show. I can't say that I've been experiencing hallucinations or feeling disconnected from reality, but these confusing thoughts are making it hard for me to maintain my relationships.
Lately, I've been feeling strange. I've been hearing these voices in my head that sometimes comment on my actions or say quite rude things about me. It's been happening for a month now, and it's really bothering me. Sometimes, I have these fleeting thoughts that people are conspiring against me, but I know it's not true. It's just that these thoughts come out of nowhere. Though I'm not experiencing any other weird feelings or thoughts, I'm worried about my mental health since these symptoms have been affecting my work and social life.
Lately, I've been feeling very strange. I find it hard to sleep, and I feel like my thoughts are jumbled and racing. I've become very withdrawn, and I've lost interest in things that used to make me happy, like hanging out with friends or playing music. The other day, while I was walking in the park, I thought I heard someone calling my name, but no one was there. I haven't had any other experiences like this, but it's really worrying me. Can you help me understand what's going on?
For the past few weeks, I've been feeling really off. I've been having trouble concentrating and feel like my thoughts are disorganized. Sometimes, I feel like people are talking about me behind my back, but when I try to confront them, they deny it. One night, I felt like I was being followed by a stranger, but he disappeared as soon as I turned around. I've also been feeling a bit down and not enjoying the things I used to. My mom has been really worried about me, but I just can't put my finger on what's wrong.
Lately, I've been feeling pretty off. I keep hearing voices when no one's around, but they're fuzzy and hard to understand. Sometimes I feel disconnected from reality, almost like I'm in a dream. I used to be really sociable, but now I feel like there's a barrier between me and other people. About a month ago, I had a really stressful event at work, and ever since then, these issues seem to have gotten worse. What's going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling a little off. I've been struggling to focus at work, and my colleagues noticed that I sometimes mumble to myself. It's weird, but I swear I can hear someone whispering to me. I went through a pretty stressful event a couple of weeks ago, and since then, I feel like I can't organize my thoughts as clearly as I used to. It's frustrating, but I'm still managing my daily activities and staying engaged with my family and friends.
Lately, I've been feeling really energetic, but it's not all the time. I spent a few days where I barely slept, went shopping all night, and felt really confident. My friends and family seemed worried about me, but I thought I was just in a great mood. Then, after those few days, I returned to my normal self and felt pretty drained. It's happened a few times in the past couple of months, but I don't think it's anything to be worried about. However, my friend convinced me to come and talk to you about it.
Lately, I've been feeling really down most of the time. It's like I have no energy, and I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. However, there was a week or two ago where I felt amazing; I had tons of energy and was extremely productive at work. I even started creating plans for a new business venture, but now I don't even have the motivation to work on it. My sleep has been all over the place too. One night I'll be up all night, but the next, I'll sleep 13 hours straight. My appetite has been unpredictable as well. Sometimes I forget to eat, and other times I can't stop binge eating. Is this normal?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I have these bursts of energy where I get really talkative and hyper, but they only last for a couple of hours, and then I'm back to feeling normal. I also noticed that I'm being more impulsive than usual during these episodes, like the other day I made a spur-of-the-moment decision to buy an expensive new gadget. I have moments when I feel incredibly irritable too. I don't know what's going on, I'm usually so in control of myself.
Lately, I have been experiencing a lot of mood swings. Sometimes I feel on top of the world, full of energy and creativity, but it doesn't last very long. Then I find myself sinking into a deep sadness, feeling hopeless and unmotivated. I've also noticed that my sleep patterns have been irregular. Sometimes I stay up all night working on projects, feeling like I don't need to sleep, while other times I sleep excessively and struggle to get out of bed. It all started a few months ago when I lost my job and went through a bad breakup. Can you help me understand what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling really energetic and on top of the world, like I can achieve anything. I don't feel the need to sleep as much as I used to, and I've been staying up late working on new creative projects. I've also noticed that I'm talking more than usual and can't seem to focus on my job or family life as well because I can't stop thinking about all the things I want to do. This change in my mood has been going on for a couple of weeks. However, before that, I was feeling pretty down for a few weeks. I don't recall having a more severe depressive episode though.
Lately, I've been experiencing some mood swings that I'm not sure how to deal with. I went through a period where I was full of energy, feeling unusually talkative, and having a lot of ideas. I felt like I needed very little sleep and was able to accomplish a lot. This lasted for about four days, and then I began feeling more irritable, which eventually turned into a deep sadness that lasted for the next few weeks. During this time, I lost interest in activities I usually enjoy, and I started to isolate myself from friends and family. I eventually started feeling a little better, but I'm worried about these mood swings happening again.
Lately, I've been struggling with mood swings. It started about a month ago when I began to feel more energetic and outgoing than usual. I was really enjoying myself, getting more tasks done, and even socializing more than I usually do. However, this high didn't last more than a few days. Soon after, I plunged into a period of intense sadness and sluggishness. It was difficult for me to get out of bed or go about my daily activities. This phase lasted for about a week, and then my mood seemed to stabilize. Since then, my mood has gone up and down a few more times, but the changes haven't been as extreme as that first episode. I'm worried about what's happening to me and how it might affect my relationships and work.
Lately, I've been going through a lot of ups and downs. It all started when my job got really stressful, and I felt really down and depressed. I lost interest in things I usually enjoy and had trouble focusing at work. After a while though, my mood changed, and I started to feel overly energetic, and I was sleeping a lot less. My thoughts raced, and I couldn't stop talking. I thought I could take on the world and started multiple projects all at once. It was strange because I went from feeling incredibly low to feeling on top of the world. But now I'm feeling more balanced and in control, even though I still have some occasional mood swings.
Lately, I've been feeling like I have so much energy and I'm super productive. I only need a few hours of sleep, and then I'm ready to go again. I've been taking on more projects at work and my colleagues have noticed my increased productivity. But I've also noticed that I've been talking really fast and my mind feels like it's racing with thoughts all the time. Sometimes, I become irritated easily when things don't go as planned. This has been going on for about a week now. Overall, I feel pretty good, but I'm just a bit worried because I've never experienced anything like this before.
Lately, I've been experiencing some mood changes. I have these moments when I feel extremely happy and full of energy, like I can take on the world. It's great when it lasts, but then I crash, and get really tired and irritable. Over the past month, there has been only one such episode. It only lasted for a few days, but it was intense. I've been trying to understand why it happened; there was nothing particular in my life that could cause that. I ended up spending a lot of money during this period, which wasn't good for my finances. Is this something to be concerned about?
I have been feeling extremely energized and happy for the past week, which is unusual for me. I usually have low moods and struggle with depression, but this sudden shift has me feeling like I can conquer anything. I've been sleeping less and working on various projects – though I don't seem to be able to complete them. My friends say I'm talking a lot more and acting impulsively, but I just feel like I'm living my best life. I know it's strange, but I'm not sure if something is wrong with me.
Lately, I've been feeling pretty off. I've had a few days where I felt more energetic and confident than usual, and I found myself talking a lot during those times, but it didn't last long. I've also had trouble sleeping, but I don't think it's been affecting my daily life significantly. I've noticed that I've been more irritable, but I haven't had any major mood swings or anything. There was one time last week when I was at a party, and I did something embarrassing, but I didn't really think much of it until my friends told me about it later. Overall, I just feel a bit more up and down than usual, but I'm not sure what's going on.
Lately, I've been feeling really energetic, like I can't sit still and do anything for a long period of time. In the past few weeks, I've started multiple projects, but I never seem to finish them before jumping into something else. Sleep has become a challenge too; I feel like I don't need it as much as I used to. The strange thing is, I've had times in the past where I felt extremely low and hopeless, but that hasn't happened recently. It's just been all this energy, and it's starting to affect my relationships and work.
Lately, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. Some days I feel extremely happy and energetic, like nothing can bring me down. During those days, I find myself taking on several tasks at once and feeling very focused. But after a few days, I suddenly feel down, and everything seems gloomy. I lose interest in doing anything and have trouble concentrating. This has been going on for the past couple of months, and I don't understand why my emotions keep changing so dramatically.
Lately, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. My mood tends to swing from being really energetic and upbeat to feeling somewhat down and dull. The energetic moments make me feel like I can do anything, and I get so many ideas that I want to pursue. However, these moments tend to last just a few hours or maybe a day at most. Afterward, I would feel down but not too low -- I can still carry on with my daily activities. Though sometimes, I can't help but feel irritable. I remember last week, I snapped at my coworker and I regretted my reaction afterward. Sleep-wise, I'm not having much disturbance, but these mood fluctuations are concerning me.
Lately, I've been feeling very up and down with my mood. One day, I feel full of energy and very confident, but the next day, I'm feeling quite sad and overwhelmed. The energetic days typically last for only a day or two, and then I return to feeling low. It's been causing trouble in my relationships and at work, as I find it difficult to focus on tasks. Sometimes, I get really irritable too. There wasn't any specific event or situation that caused these mood changes, but it has been happening for the past few months.
Lately, I've been feeling really different. It started about two months ago after I broke up with my partner. My emotions have been all over the place, and I've been having a hard time keeping them in control. There are days when I feel really happy and energetic, like I can take on the whole world. I even started volunteering at a local shelter, which is something I've never done before. But you know what's strange is that, during this time, I'm only sleeping for a few hours. Then there are other days when I feel incredibly down and I just want to stay in bed all day. I feel a lack of motivation, and everything seems hopeless. But these emotional swings don't seem to last more than a few days at a time. What do you think is going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling really down and unmotivated. It started a couple of weeks ago and I just can't seem to shake it. In the past, I've had moments where I felt incredibly high energy, optimistic and almost unstoppable, but these moments were brief and didn't affect my life too much. During this low period, I'm having trouble concentrating and I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy. I am sleeping more than usual and sometimes it's difficult to get out of bed. I don't think I've ever experienced anything quite like this before.
Lately, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. For about a week, I was feeling really energetic and motivated, like I could conquer anything and that there weren't enough hours in the day for all the things I wanted to do. But, after that week, I suddenly felt incredibly low, and I couldn't bring myself to do anything. I just felt like I was in a dark and heavy place. This emotional rollercoaster is affecting my life, but the high-energy phase seems to have happened only once. Can you help me understand what's going on?
Lately, I've been experiencing some unusual mood changes. I have moments where I feel extremely upbeat and full of energy, but they don't last very long. I've also noticed that I feel more irritable than usual, and I have a hard time focusing on tasks. There was one time last week where I spent a lot of money on an impulse purchase, which is not something I normally do. I'm not sure if this is a problem or just a phase I'm going through.
Lately, I've been feeling really ups and downs in my mood. I've had days where I feel super energetic, like I can do anything, and other days where it's hard to even get out of bed. During my energetic days, I sometimes find myself talking a mile a minute, and I can't seem to concentrate on one thing for too long. It's almost like I have too many ideas in my head, and I jump from topic to topic when talking to friends. I wouldn't say it's affecting my job or relationships too badly, but it's definitely noticeable. Also, I can't recall having any depressive episodes before this started happening.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. I've noticed that my mood has been swinging between really high and really low over the last few weeks. Sometimes, I feel extremely energetic and super productive, and I can't seem to stop talking. Other times, I feel really down and hopeless, and I have trouble even getting out of bed. But these mood swings don't last very long, maybe just a couple of days before switching again. The only thing I can think of that might have triggered these mood changes was a recent break-up, but that was almost a month ago, so I'm not sure if it's related.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. It's like my mood swings are out of control. One moment, I'm incredibly happy, and the next, I'm feeling so down. Some days, I also get irritated easily. I don't know how this started, but it's been going on for almost two weeks now. I thought it might be due to work stress or a lack of sleep, but I'm not sure. The thing is, I haven't experienced any major high or low points, and I'm not 100% sure if there's a pattern to my mood swings. I haven't been this way all my life; it's just been happening recently. Can you help me understand what's going on?
Lately, I've been feeling very energetic and overly excited, more than usual. I find it difficult to concentrate at work and feel distracted. My friends tell me I've been talking very fast and my thoughts seem to be racing. They're also concerned that I've been overspending on things I don't need. I can't remember feeling this way before, and it started about two weeks ago.
I have been feeling really up and down lately. A few weeks ago, I was extremely happy and energetic, and I was getting so much done at work. I barely needed to sleep, and I was so confident in myself. But now, I've been feeling quite the opposite. I am tired all the time, and I can't seem to find motivation for anything. I've been feeling so low and overwhelmed with negativity. It's driving me crazy how these sudden mood swings are affecting my life, but I don't think I ever experienced any serious depressive episodes before. Can you help me understand what's going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling pretty 'up,' like I have a lot of energy and can tackle anything. I just never want to slow down. At times, it's really hard for me to sleep at night, but it doesn't seem to be affecting me too much. I've been finishing projects even if I'm losing some sleep. A few days ago, though, it was like someone flipped a switch, and I felt pretty down. I couldn't really find any enthusiasm for anything. These mood swings have happened a few times, but I can't remember if there was any manic episode in the past.
Lately, I've been feeling quite emotional, and it's been interfering with my daily life. Over the past few weeks, I've had periods where I feel extremely energetic and talkative, but they only last for a few hours, and then I'm back to my normal self. During these episodes, my friends have told me that I seem really confident and excited about everything, and it's like I can't sit still. I've also had a couple of sleepless nights, but it doesn't happen often. This has been affecting my relationships and work, but it's not constant, and I can go days without experiencing these feelings. Can you give me some advice?
Hey, so for the past couple of weeks, I've been feeling really energetic and excited about life. I've been staying up super late working on creative projects and my mind just doesn't seem to want to quiet down. I'm getting a little less sleep than usual, but I still feel pretty good. I've noticed that I've been more talkative and social lately, but it doesn't seem too extreme. Overall, I've been pretty productive recently. This has happened a few times in my life, but it never lasts too long and doesn't affect my daily life significantly. What's going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling really restless and energetic, like I just can't stay still. I always find myself getting involved in too many activities and my family says I talk too fast. I've also noticed that I hardly need any sleep; in the past few days, I've been running on about 3 hours a night. My mind is constantly racing with thoughts, and I sometimes make impulsive decisions or spend a lot of money on unnecessary things. But I haven't always been like this, there was a time when I was really down and had trouble getting out of bed for weeks.
Lately, I've been feeling really up and down. There are days when I feel extremely high-energy and overly excited, and I'm able to accomplish so much. But other days, I feel pretty low and I can't get myself to do anything. I've never had a major depressive episode, but these highs and lows still affect my daily life. The high-energy days have caused me trouble at work, as I tend to get too excited and make impulsive decisions. On the low-energy days, I struggle to get out of bed and even have a hard time having a conversation with my friends or family. Can you help me understand what's going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling like I have so much energy, and I barely need any sleep. I get these fantastic ideas, and I'm working on multiple projects all the time. My friends tell me that I've been talking non-stop and jumping from topic to topic. There were times when I felt down, but not too severe or frequent.
Lately, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. I have days where I'm really energized and I feel like I can do anything, but there are also days when I feel really low and struggle to get out of bed. During my high-energy days, I find myself getting distracted easily and having a hard time focusing on my tasks. I've also been having some trouble sleeping, and often stay up all night. Last week, I had an argument with my friend and impulsively spent a large sum of money on things I didn't really need. I've never felt this way before and I'm not sure what's going on.
Lately, I've been experiencing some changes in my mood and energy levels. For the past few weeks, I've been feeling extremely energetic and way more confident than usual. I've found myself talking more and needing less sleep, maybe 4 hours a night. I also started a project that I've been working on non-stop, but I'm not really making much progress. I've been quite irritable with people around me, even snapping at my friends and family, which I regret. I remember having one depressive episode about a year ago, but nothing like this has happened before.
Lately, I've been feeling really different. I have more energy than usual, and I've been feeling so happy and confident, like I can achieve anything. I've been staying up late working on various projects, and I don't feel the need for sleep as much anymore. My friends say I talk a lot more and much faster than before. I've made a lot of impulsive decisions recently, like going on a shopping spree and spending all my savings, but somehow, I don't feel guilty or regretful. However, this has only been going on for a few days, and it hasn't really caused any serious problems in my life.
For the past few weeks, I've been experiencing mood swings, but they don't seem as extreme as what I've read about bipolar disorder. I do feel more energetic and impulsive than usual at times, but it doesn't impair my ability to function at work or in social situations. I also find it difficult to focus sometimes, and my thoughts race, making it hard to sleep, but I typically still get about 6 hours of sleep each night. There was one similar period like this last year that lasted a couple of weeks, too.
Lately, I've been experiencing some ups and downs in my mood. There are times when I feel really energetic and creative, like I could take on any challenge. During these high moments, I tend to make impulsive decisions and even started some new projects. But they don't last long, maybe a week or so. Then, I start to feel the complete opposite. I lose my motivation, feel sad, and have no interest in things I usually enjoy. This low period also only lasts a week. These mood swings have been affecting my relationships and work. What could be happening to me?
Lately, I've been feeling really different. It started about a few weeks ago where I had lots of energy, and I barely needed any sleep. I was super productive at work and was coming up with great ideas. But then after a week, my mood changed and I started feeling down, like really low. I even called in sick a couple of days because I couldn't get out of bed. I've experienced mood swings before, but nothing like this. Now I'm just feeling a bit strange and was wondering if I should be concerned.
Lately, I've been feeling quite different than before. For the past few weeks, I've had a lot more energy, but I don't think it's extreme. I mean, I'm doing more things and being more social than before, but I don't think I'm experiencing any real issues. One day last week, I did feel an extreme boost of energy, and I couldn't sit still. I was also very talkative for a few hours that day. However, other than that day, I haven't really had any major shifts in my mood or behavior. I've been able to sleep well through the night and have no problem falling asleep. I don't have any history of depression or any other mental health issues, and this energy increase hasn't affected my work or my relationships yet.
Lately, I've been experiencing high energy levels and significant mood swings. I don't usually have these extreme ups and downs, but it's been happening for about two weeks now. When I have high energy, I get really productive and sometimes, even it's hard for me to sleep. During those times, I also find myself talking a lot more and jumping from one topic to another. But then, just as quickly, my mood changes, and I feel down. I haven't had any thoughts of self-harm, and I haven't experienced any periods of intense sadness or depression that has interfered with my daily life recently. Could you tell me what's going on?
Lately, I've been experiencing some mood changes, and it's concerning me. I've had a couple of days where I felt on top of the world, energetic, and super productive. I was talking a mile a minute, and I couldn't seem to sit still. It didn't last long, though, maybe a day or two at most, and it didn't disrupt my daily life too much. I don't think I had any noticeable mood swings before this. My friends did notice my behavior, but they didn't seem too concerned. After a couple of days, I came back to my normal self and everything seemed fine. But I'm worried that these episodes might happen again.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit stressed and worried about different things. On a few occasions, I noticed that I had difficulty focusing and my mind would keep drifting to thoughts of what could go wrong in the future. I'm also struggling to sleep well. It's been happening for about two months, but it doesn't really consume me all day long. I still manage to get my daily tasks done, but I'm just not as carefree and relaxed as I used to be.
Lately, I've been feeling pretty anxious, but it's not always about the same thing. Some days I worry about my job, other days it's about my family or friends or even little things like making a mistake in a conversation. The worrying doesn't happen every day, but maybe 3 or 4 times a week? When it does happen, I can't seem to shake it off, and it lasts for a few hours. I've noticed that I'm a little more irritable and I can't concentrate as well as I used to. Sometimes the anxiety keeps me up at night, but I wouldn't say I struggle with sleep most of the time. Do you think it's something I should be concerned about?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit more worried than usual. My work life has been pretty stressful, with multiple deadlines to meet, and my personal life hasn't been much better. I'm constantly worrying about small things, like whether or not I've locked the front door, or if I've left the stove on. I've lost some sleep over it too, but not every night, and my focus has been slightly affected. Throughout the day, I find myself feeling restless and occasionally irritable, but I've been trying my best to manage these feelings. Overall, I'd say the past few weeks have been more stressful than my typical day-to-day life.
Lately, I've been feeling really worried about everything, even small things like misplacing my keys or being late to a meeting. My mind is constantly racing, and it's hard to concentrate on my work. I've been sleeping less than usual because I can't stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong. It's been going on for over a month now, but I can't pinpoint any specific cause for my anxiety. It just seems to be a constant, nagging feeling that's always in the back of my mind.
Lately, I've been feeling pretty stressed with everything happening at work. I'm constantly worried about meeting deadlines and my performance. Some days, I find it hard to concentrate, and my coworkers have noticed that I've become irritable. I'm not sure if it's affecting me physically, but my sleeping pattern has been a bit off. I have a feeling that it's just work-related stress, but I wanted to talk to someone about it.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit on edge and worried about various things like work, my family, and just everyday tasks. Sometimes the worries keep me up at night, but it doesn't happen all the time. It's been going on for maybe a month or so, and while it's frustrating, it hasn't really affected my ability to function normally. My friends say I'm a worrywart, but I wonder if there's something more to it.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit anxious about various things in my life. It's not constant, but it comes and goes. Sometimes, I worry about work, my relationships, and even my health. These thoughts aren't always there, but when they pop up, they make me feel uneasy and stressed. The other day, I had trouble falling asleep because I was worrying about an upcoming event at work. My anxiety doesn't completely interfere with my daily activities, but it's enough to make me feel uncomfortable and on edge.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit on edge and finding it hard to focus at work. Sometimes, I can't help but worry about different things, like deadlines and family matters. I've also noticed that my heart races occasionally and I get this tight feeling in my chest. It's been going on for around a month but there are days where I feel perfectly fine and in control. I'm starting to wonder if something is wrong with me.
Lately, I've been feeling worried but not all the time. I get these sudden bursts of anxiety, especially when I'm at work. It feels like my heart is pounding, and I can't breathe. Each episode only lasts a few minutes, but it's really impacting my life. I don't think I've been sleeping well, either. It's just hard to shake off these moments of panic and it doesn't seem to be related to any specific thing.
Lately, I've been feeling pretty stressed out. I've been constantly worrying about various things like my health, relationships, and work. It's been hard to control these thoughts and I often feel restless. However, I've been able to carry on with my daily activities without any major disruption. Sometimes, I have trouble sleeping because of my worries, but it's not every night. This has been going on for around 4 months now, but I've never experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or muscle tension because of it.
Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with my work. I often find myself worrying about things that might happen, even though most of them never actually do. I've lost a few hours of sleep due to these thoughts, but it's not a constant issue. I have good days too, when I don't feel worried at all. But, on those bad days, it's difficult for me to concentrate on my work, and I end up not being as productive as I would like to be. It's been affecting my performance at work and I feel like I don't even enjoy my hobbies as much as I used to.
Lately, I've been feeling more anxious than usual. I worry about a lot of things, like my job, my family, and even small daily tasks. Sometimes it's hard to control my worries, but I think it's just because of the current situation in my life. I also have some trouble concentrating at work, but it doesn't affect my overall performance. It comes and goes, and it's not every day. It's been going on for about a month now, and I'm not sure what to do.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit anxious and worried about different things in my life, like work, my relationships, and my health. I think it's been going on for about four months now. I find myself overthinking situations and fearing the worst, even though nothing serious has happened. I've been having trouble falling asleep, and when I do, I often wake up in the middle of the night. I'm feeling quite exhausted from all the worrying, but I don't think it's affecting my daily life as much.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit on edge, but I don't think it's anything too serious. It seems to come and go, depending on what's happening in my life. For example, I've been worrying a lot about my job security due to the pandemic, but it's not constant. I can still go to work, focus on my tasks, and maintain a relatively normal life, but sometimes I lay awake at night for an hour or two just thinking about what might happen if I lose my job. I also find myself feeling a little irritable when my kids make noise or don't complete their chores. I've had a few restless nights, but I wouldn't say it's affecting my overall life. Is this something I should be concerned about?
Lately, I've been feeling anxious and worried about various things in my life, such as work, family, and even small matters like what to wear. However, the worrying doesn't happen every day, just a few times a week. It's frustrating because I can't seem to stop my mind from racing all the time. It's been affecting my sleep, and I often feel tired and restless. I've also noticed that my concentration has decreased and it's been difficult for me to make decisions. It's been going on for about four months now.
Lately, I've been feeling worried about a lot of things, but I can't really put my finger on why. Sometimes I worry about my job, my health, or even just little everyday things like what to cook for dinner. These thoughts aren't constant, but they do come and go pretty often. To be honest, I can't remember the last time I was very relaxed. But, it doesn't really get in the way of my day-to-day life. My sleep hasn't been great, I stay up worrying about things, but I'm able to fall asleep eventually. But I do feel tired during the day.
Lately, I've been feeling worried about a lot of things. My job, my family, and my health all seem to be sources of anxiety for me, but I can't pinpoint exactly why. It's been going on for maybe three or four months now. Some days are better than others, but there are times when I get really stressed out and my heart starts racing, and other times when the worry doesn't feel very intense. I can still go to work and do my daily activities, but this constant feeling of uneasiness is just bothersome.
Lately, I have been feeling a bit tense and on edge. It has been difficult for me to stop worrying about things like my job, my relationship, and even if I will complete my daily chores on time. It has been going on for about three months, and I feel like it's affecting my mood and sleep. However, I haven't experienced any physical symptoms like fatigue or restlessness, and it's not affecting my daily activities too much. I had a difficult childhood, and I am wondering if that could be the root cause of my worries.
Lately, I've been feeling kind of worried about various things in my life - my job, my family, my relationship, even my health. I haven't been sleeping very well, and I sometimes have difficulty concentrating at work, especially during these last few weeks. However, I feel like it's not affecting my overall daily life too much. When I think about it, I've always been a worrier, ever since I was a child. Last week, I had a major disagreement with my partner, and since then, I find myself restless and constantly checking my phone for messages. This feels like a big issue for me, and I would like to be more relaxed.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit anxious and worried about several things in my life. Work has been hectic, and I'm concerned about my performance. Additionally, I'm having some trouble in my relationship, which adds to my stress. I can't seem to shake off these feelings, and it's been bothering me for almost two months now. I feel restless and irritable, and sometimes I have difficulty sleeping. I've never felt this way before, and I wonder if there's something wrong with me.
Lately, I've been feeling really anxious about a lot of things in my life. I worry about my job, my family, and my health. I find it hard to control my thoughts with all this worry. It's affecting my ability to concentrate at work and I hardly sleep. But, this anxiety comes and goes. Like last week, I had three really good days where I felt very relaxed. Also, when I'm around my friends, I usually forget about my worries and feel better.
Lately, I've been feeling quite worried about a few things, but I wouldn't say it's excessive. I have a big project at work coming up, and it's been on my mind a lot. My manager noticed a decline in my productivity, and I've realized I'm having difficulty concentrating. When I get home from work, I am often tense and edgy, but my partner says I've been like this on and off for the past four months. It's not like I'm constantly worrying about everything, but I do have anxious moments. Overall, I'm still able to maintain my daily routine and activities without too much disruption.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit anxious, but I don't think it's anything too extreme. My mind does race from time to time, especially when I think about work, my family, or my health. I've noticed that these thoughts can occur randomly and I can't always control them. However, it's not like I'm always worried or on edge. Overall, I feel like I can manage my anxiety. In general, I don't have too much trouble sleeping, and my appetite is pretty normal. There have been a few occasions where my heart rate has been elevated and I've felt restless, but these episodes are not a regular occurrence.
Lately, I've been feeling quite anxious about various things in my life. My job has been pretty stressful, and I'm constantly worried about my relationship with my partner. I find myself worrying about things that others might consider trivial. I've also been experiencing headaches and difficulty concentrating at work. This has been going on for about 3 months. It is not affecting every aspect of my life, but it is becoming more noticeable. I don't think these feelings are completely overwhelming me, but I do want to understand why I'm feeling like this.
Hey, I've been feeling a bit uneasy lately. Like, I get worried about things that may go wrong, even though I know they probably won't. It's not like I'm constantly worrying or anything, but it just bugs me from time to time, you know? The other night, I couldn't fall asleep because I kept thinking about a presentation that I have to give in a couple of weeks. I know it's irrational, I've given presentations before and they've gone well, but I still can't help feeling a little anxious. It's like my brain just goes in circles sometimes, thinking about all the things that could go wrong and all the ways I can mess up. It's not affecting my daily life, I am still able to go to work and attend social events, but sometimes I just wish I could turn my brain off for a bit.
Lately, I've been feeling quite anxious and worried about various aspects of my life, such as work, family, and personal relationships. These feelings have been going on for the past few months, and I find it hard to control my worries. I've also been experiencing some physical symptoms like muscle tension and occasional upset stomach. However, these symptoms don't occur every day. I've noticed that these feelings and symptoms get worse when I have a particularly stressful day or encounter a challenging situation. Sometimes, though, I can't identify any specific triggers for my anxiety.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit more worried than usual, but I can't really put my finger on why. I've had a few changes in my life recently, like moving to a new city and starting a new job. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep, but other nights I sleep just fine. I can still focus on my work most of the time, but occasionally my mind wanders to random things I'm worried about. It's been going on for a couple of months now. What do you think is going on?
Lately, I've been feeling anxious about different things in my life, like work and relationships. It's been going on for a couple of months now, and just the other day, my heart started pounding during a presentation. I also get muscle tension and sometimes can't sleep, although I don't really worry every single day. I've been thinking about talking to a professional, but I thought I'd get some advice here first.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit off, to say the least. Every day, I find myself worrying about the smallest things, like if I locked the door or if I turned off the stove. Sometimes my mind just drifts, and I start thinking about how everything might go wrong. I've been like this for almost five months, but it comes and goes. There are days when I feel completely at ease, and then the next day, I'm back to being worried sick. My chest tightens up, and I get this sense of dread deep inside my stomach. I've even gotten so worked up that I lost sleep a couple of times. Could you help me understand what's going on with me?
Lately, I've been feeling more anxious than usual. It's been about a month, and I just can't seem to shake this constant worry that's following me around. At work, I'm worrying about deadlines, even when I know I'm on track. When I'm home, I'm concerned about my family's health and other issues. It's strange because I've never been this anxious before. Most nights, I find it difficult to fall asleep, and when I finally do, I wake up several times throughout the night. Some days it's so bad that I have trouble concentrating on my tasks. But it's not always this bad, some days I'm okay, and I can handle everything fine.
Lately, I've been feeling really stressed out about work and life in general. There are times when I think everything is just piling up and I won't be able to handle it. It happens a few times a week and although it's not every day, these worrying thoughts still bother me. Sometimes, it's hard for me to concentrate on what I'm doing because of these worries. Additionally, I've noticed that I'm more irritable than usual and having trouble sleeping at night. All these issues started a couple of months ago, but I don't know why they appeared out of nowhere.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit more worried than usual, and I can't seem to pinpoint why. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed at work, even though my workload hasn't changed. I also have trouble falling asleep, and my mind tends to race at night, making it nearly impossible to relax. While these feelings don't happen every day, they have been occurring more frequently over the past few weeks. I'd really like some help in figuring out why I'm suddenly so anxious and what I can do to get better.
For the past few weeks, I've been feeling worried a lot. I guess it's because of my new job, and I'm sure I'll get used to it soon. But this worry is affecting my sleep. I sometimes stay up late, worrying about the smallest things like if my boss will like my work or if I can make friends at work. My mind runs through multiple scenarios, making me more and more nervous. It's not happening every day, maybe two or three times a week.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit worried about different things in my life. I get anxious about work, my relationships, and even small things like whether I'm doing a good job as a parent. I find it hard to relax, but it's not completely taking over my life. Overall, I can still manage my day-to-day activities. It's just that sometimes my heart races, and I can't stop thinking about all the possible bad outcomes. I feel on edge, but the feeling comes and goes. I'm curious, is this something I should be concerned about?
Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with life in general, you know? It feels like I can't stop worrying about everything. From work deadlines to my kids' school stuff and even small things like if I've left the stove on. But it's weird because it doesn't happen all the time, maybe a few days a week. It's been happening for about 4 months now. I haven't had any trouble with sleeping or concentrating, but it does make me feel tense and on edge. Last week, I went to my friend's wedding, and I couldn't even enjoy it because I kept thinking about all my worries.
Lately, I've been feeling kind of anxious about a lot of things. For example, I worry about my job performance, and if I don't get a text back from my friends right away, I start thinking they might be mad at me. I had a few restless nights of sleep, and sometimes I feel a bit on edge, but it's not like I'm constantly worrying about everything all the time. I'm still able to focus and function in my daily life, but I just can't shake off this feeling of anxiety.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit on edge. It's hard to pinpoint when this started, but it's been a few weeks, I think. I constantly worry about small things, like if I'll be late for work or if I said something awkward to a colleague. The other day, I was anxious all day because I couldn't remember if I had locked my front door. I know it's not a big deal, but these thoughts consume me. It's not affecting my sleep, but sometimes I find it hard to focus on tasks at work. It's frustrating but doesn't happen all the time. Is this something I should be concerned about?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit stressed out, and I worry about a lot of things, like work, family, and my health. It feels like this has been going on for a few months now, but it's not constant. I feel tense most of the time, and it's hard to concentrate on tasks. My sleep is sometimes affected, and I often lie awake at night worrying about things. My friends say I should relax, but I just can't seem to help it.
Lately, I have been feeling worried about various things in my life. For instance, I keep thinking about deadlines at work, even though I seem to be completing tasks on time. I also get concerned about my family and their well-being, though nothing bad has happened. These feelings happen four or five times a week, and I've noticed my sleep has suffered as a result. I often lie awake at night, feeling restless and tense. However, most days, I can still manage to go about my daily activities without much issue.
Lately, it's just been so hard to manage all my responsibilities. Between work, family, and trying to make enough time for myself, I feel constantly stressed out. Sometimes, I can't even fall asleep at night because my mind is racing with everything I have to do the next day. But I have noticed that it's not always excessive, there are days when I feel pretty okay. I also consider myself more of a worrier about stuff, like I catch myself worrying about things that haven't even happened yet or are unlikely to happen. But still, it doesn't affect my ability to carry out my daily tasks.
I've been dealing with some trauma and flashbacks from a past event, and it's been two years. I feel like I should be over it by now, but I know it's not going to go away completely. I've seen how World War II and Vietnam veterans still struggle with their experiences.
I used to go to a hospital for counselling, but after two semesters of helping with this organization for veterans, I noticed that I don't need the counseling anymore. It's hard to tell how it happened, but now I'm better.
I was functioning normally and happy before this recent incident. I am satisfied with my activities in school and involvement, but after talking to a journalist, I've experienced a resurgence of PTSD and flashbacks.
I think I've done a lot with my emotions, like reviewing and re-checking them while I went to the VA hospital. That counseling was really helpful for me.
I stopped going to school and started traveling due to my busy schedule, having to travel from Fullerton to Long Beach. There are 300 veterans in school, and I thought they all need help, so I was motivated to create a facility for veterans. We have talked to the school and got a promise that they will provide a facility for veterans in the future.
As a patient, I've been struggling with the idea that being strong means not having feelings. This mentality was embedded in me during my time as a soldier, and now I think it's affecting my ability to express and process emotions.
Sometimes I feel like other veterans look up to me and I must be strong for them, but I also struggle with my own emotions. It's hard for me to express my feelings and I don't know if I can be a good role model in that sense.
I've been feeling a mix of anger and sadness, but I've been repressing the sadness inwardly because I think people don't understand what I'm going through. I avoid talking about it because I don't want to waste their time since they wouldn't understand.
I recently had a conversation with a journalist about my time in Iraq which triggered memories about specific events and the soldiers I knew who got killed. These thoughts brought up strong feelings of sadness as well as anger towards the policies and decisions that placed the soldiers there.
Lately, I've been involved with the Student Veterans Association on campus, and we're preparing a veteran appreciation event. I had an interview with a journalist, and his questions about my experience during deployment in Iraq made me think.
It's been two years since I returned from deployment in Iraq, and I recently had a flashback when a journalist asked about the names of the soldiers who were killed. This made me think about the details of the deployment, which triggered some PTSD symptoms. After coming home, I've been dealing with sensitive anger issues and nightmares for about six to eight months.
I have two issues that bother me. I am very sensitive to noises, surroundings, and certain conversations. Topics like war and government make me angry, resentful, and sad. However, due to my calm and empathetic personality, I don't act out on these feelings and instead, they go inward.
I'm a former soldier and during deployment, I experienced constant numbness due to the pressured and alert situations. I had to repress my emotions to focus on my duties. Now, two years later, I still find it difficult to process the extreme emotions, sadness, and mixed feelings associated with those memories.
I have been experiencing PTSD since the traumatic event. When I was in that situation, I numbed myself and now, after coming home, the symptoms have escalated. I don't recall having flashbacks or nightmares while I was there but, back then, we didn't have time to think and act according to our emotions. Is hypervigilance another symptom of PTSD?
I feel like in certain situations, we just become numb and have to move on to the next mission. It's hard knowing that things are out of our control, and we just have to cope with it. We're in a war, and we have to be strong.
I come from a military background and I've always been told that I have to be strong. Being strong means disregarding my emotions.
I've been living in a much better place now, appreciating my civilian life. But when a journalist asked me a question and I had a flashback, at that moment I felt like a soldier again, seeing somebody dead or hearing about someone's death. Thankfully, as a Human Services Major, I'm learning how to focus on my emotions more.
I recently had a conversation with a fellow veteran that brought up different emotions for me. Also, I've been working on some painful and difficult experiences in my journal.
I think it's natural, but what I'm doing right now is sharing my feelings with my partner, even though we don't usually talk a lot about them. It's just hard sometimes, and we need to focus on planning for our future.
For me, it's hard to be in control of my feelings and access them.
The reason, reason why is, ah, where I was, I was transferred to three different, ah, remote places in Iraq, we get mortar attacks all the time. Ah, mortar incoming is, ah, such an easy, ah, weapon for them to use, and it's hard to detect. So, they would use it. Uhm, I'll, I'll say two, three times a week, we get mortar incoming, and you just don't know where it's gonna land. And the, the noise of it, the impact of it is just tremendous. And, uhm, when you first get there within like three to four weeks, you are, you are hyper-vigilant. You are just so concerned or you're so worried. But after that, after a certain time, you just cannot be like that anymore because you gotta sleep, you gotta eat, you gotta do what you gotta do to, to continue your mission.
I was a soldier and during deployment, we experienced a lot of anxiety and nervousness. We were always on the road and road-side bombs were the biggest threat to us. At the beginning, we had constant thoughts about who's going to get hit, what's going to happen, and if we would be able to survive the next day.
For the past two or three weeks, there have been random instances of bombing or no bombing at all, which makes the situation really hard to predict.
I've been struggling to accept the pain I'm experiencing, and it's hard to express it in a constructive way. I feel like my emotions make up only half of me, and that makes me feel weak.
As a patient, I would like to express my gratitude for being heard and empathized with after sharing my experiences as a soldier. I have survived situations that most people don't get close to, and I appreciate your acknowledgment of it.
Recently, I've been feeling good and plan to continue what I'm doing. However, I want to be a role model in terms of handling emotions. Is there anything else I could do or add on to help me achieve this? Any small suggestions would be appreciated.
I am feeling better and enjoying life now. I would like to invite other veterans to be a part of our new team or group so that we can enjoy the school environment again.
I was watching an action movie and talking to my dad on the phone. I'm going to take the list home and see if anything else comes to mind that I might be avoiding due to the fear of having a panic attack.
I really don't like driving on the expressway and haven't done it in years. That's a 10 on my fear scale. I can drive on a two-lane road if it's not too busy, but it's still a 4 or 6 depending on the time of day and the road. I also don't like waiting in line at the grocery store; if I have to do that for too long, it makes me feel like I just have to get out of there.
I have anxiety issues and I don't go to the theater anymore. I used to go and sit by the door, but now I just don't go. Sitting by the door was better than in the middle. Going to the theater and sitting by the door would be a six or a seven on the anxiety scale, but sitting anywhere else is a 10. Watching an action movie at home would be a one or a two.
I sometimes avoid watching certain things, and I get nervous before calling my father, especially if there's a problem or conflict. I rated the anxiety of calling my dad as a two because I generally enjoy talking to him if it's casual. I also have a high fear of driving on the expressway and going to the theater and medium fear when driving on a two-lane road and standing in line at a grocery store.
I'm getting encouragement from the business school about my community work and management skills. The dean says I can pursue graduate school, except for a couple of statistical courses. However, my husband who used to be encouraging is now not so supportive. Also, another counselor seemed to doubt my reasons for wanting to go back to school. I'm feeling conflicted and don't know what to do.
I know I want to do something but I don't want to destroy my relationship in my marriage and my family. I want it both. I guess I want it all.
I visited a counselor a few months ago because I was considering going back to graduate school but wasn't sure if it was the right choice. After talking to them, I decided perhaps graduate school wasn't the best option, but that hasn't resolved my issues. Someone mentioned that you might be helpful since you've had a similar experience. I'd like to know how you went about going back to graduate school and if you have any advice for me.
I have been at home raising my children, but I've also been active in the community, serving on local boards and as the President of the League of Women Voters. I discovered that I have good management skills, so I decided to return to graduate school. I have visited the business school, and my graduate record is good enough. The dean even encouraged me to come back.
I felt there are a lot of opportunities. As I got really good about myself, I'm jumping out of the field and so I was encouraged and, and then I told my husband about it and uhm, it was the first, I suddenly felt my head, ah, dropped an atomic bomb or something in the house because he got really upset, and didn't understand why I wanna go back to graduate school and ah, he even told me he didn't know [content removed]
I am feeling overwhelmed with managing my household, doing all the things I am used to doing, and maintaining my privacy. I am hesitant to join a support group because I don't want the whole world knowing my problems, and I am embarrassed about it.
I recently went through a divorce and, in some ways, I didn't even want to be associated with it. The thought of having a support group is interesting because, through the years, I've felt like I wouldn't need anything like that. But now, I find myself in this position and it's really interesting.
As a matter of fact, we have three kids who are all going to college, and it's causing a significant financial expense for our family. I thought one of the things my husband would be delighted about was my decision to go back to work and help provide some assistance. But we're not able to do some things because of this financial burden.
I recently decided to go back to school, and it has been challenging to involve my family and change their roles. I've been struggling with resistance from them and wondered how someone else managed to make it work.
As a Chinese-American mother, I feel like I face some challenges when trying to balance my progressive beliefs with my traditional ones, especially when it comes to my family's expectations and education.
I think I was the black sheep in my family because my mom was always pushing education and extracurricular activities, and I just wasn't interested in them. I do recognize my mom's passion and the positive influence she may have had on me.
I feel like I'm a good person, but my mom can't see past labels and physical appearances to understand that. She only occasionally recognizes my good qualities when I do something she would do.
I feel like there are many things that could improve in my life if I just looked past the shallow and superficial aspects. But I struggle to do so.
I feel that some people have the privilege of not having to self-analyze and just accept what's around them. My family doesn't seem to have that privilege, and I think it's because they aren't able to self-analyze. I've been trying to analyze my privilege and how I go through the world.
I don't like that feeling of acceptance. It's how I'm accepting of my privilege or I'm not going to think about. I just feel like it's a lot of uncaring about others. Maybe that's off topic, I don't know. How did I get where I am?
I enjoy questioning things, even if it goes against what my parents say is right or wrong. Sometimes, I question things even when they don't feel right to me.
I never imagined my mom would say she doesn't agree with my transition but still loves me as her child. I think I've given too much power to the gender binary and not enough passion to my mom. It's exhausting arguing about these things.
I don't know if my family members see past their own privilege in many ways. They have economic and class privilege.
I recently did an exercise in one of my psych classes on the football field. It was part of our psycho minority classes, and I am not sure about its impact on me.
During a class activity, we all stood on a football field and were asked questions about our privileges. I looked behind me because there were people in front of me, but I noticed that not everyone did that. It made me think about how people with privilege tend to stop looking back and only focus on moving forward.
I was adopted by my mom at six months old because she wanted a girl. However, I have not been able to fulfill her expectations, and she still tries to push me to be someone I'm not, unable to fully accept me for who I am.
I am 24 years old and adopted by my mom because she really wanted to have a daughter. She always talks about the close relationship she had with her own mother and how important the mother-daughter bond is. It was really difficult for me to tell her that, sorry, she doesn't really have a daughter.
As a patient, I feel like my mom was really passionate about having a daughter and it was a large chunk of her life. Her life mainly revolves around hard work and family.
I see my sister as being so passionate about being a mom, especially having a daughter.
I try to approach personal matters and conversations by saying this is what's good for me, this is what feels right for me, and I encourage others to act at their own pace, doing what feels good as long as it doesn't harm themselves or others. But I'm wondering if there are different risks and consequences for people based on their various personal, familial, and cultural backgrounds when it comes to being out.
I don't know if there was ever a greater risk for me than now. I've always had thoughts of my family disowning me, but in the back of my mind and deepest part of my heart, I knew that my mom would never do that. If she did, I would prepare for it, but I never felt that part of me snap. I always felt that her love was always going to be there. I haven't told her that.
I feel like I can't prove things to her without doing things under her standards, but those actions don't mean the same thing to me. I'd rather keep the meaning than go through with an empty action. I think that would mean more to her in the end.
I've been struggling with coming out to my family for over two and a half years, especially because some of my younger cousins have strict beliefs. I'm not questioning if I will come out, but more like when and when would I be comfortable doing that. I want to give hope and understanding to others, and doing so would require me to be out, proud, and confident.
I feel driven to be a proud and visible advocate for my cause. However, I want to make sure that those who cannot be as outspoken right now don't feel like cowards, or feel guilty for not being there for the cause. I understand that being out and visible is not always an equal opportunity endeavor for everyone.
As a patient, I think telling my story would be helpful for educational purposes, and I would love to share it. When I listen to other people's stories, I try to find similarities between me and that person.
I've found hope and inspiration by listening to other people's stories and finding points of similarity or connection with them. I want to use this conversation as an opportunity to put some hopefulness and possibility out to the world for others who may resonate with me, and I think there are some aspects of my story and identity that could be helpful to share.
I felt comfortable enough to stop the conversation in our session.
I feel like, no matter how open minded I am, there is still room for me to expand and understand what you are saying about being out and proud and then not wanting other people to feel like they need to be out if they are not there yet.
I find myself emulating my father's generosity, like when he would help families in need by providing them with housing and housewarming gifts. I'm working with a young girl who's in a tough situation herself, taking care of her siblings, and I had the idea to buy them a month's worth of groceries.
Recently, I've noticed a peculiar pattern in my life. I find it hard to explain, but it's just funny how it keeps happening. I need some explanation or advice on how to handle this.
I grew up with parents who always wanted a better life for their children. Although I don't have children yet, I see others who need help and liberation. My dad was very generous and I hope I have embodied that by sacrificing my privacy and myself, even though it feels like I'm in a cage sometimes.
I feel trapped in cages of normativity and gender that are socially constructed by the media and other people. I wish I could live happily and confidently, knowing that I am living right for myself, but these external forces make it difficult.
I could be happy and confident being myself, but I fear that my family may get really awkward with me if I am more open with them. I believe it could be a Christmas gift that I can offer to my family, but I worry about their reaction and how they may receive it.
I was talking with a friend last night about how I'm having difficulty coming out to all of my family as transgender. My friend mentioned that it's better to tell them and put the ball in their court to accept and understand me.
I think it's really important to keep rehearsing and remembering the bits of history from when we started with storytelling. My transition journey began about two and a half years ago, and I wonder if I could find some seeds of it in ideas, hopes, or dreams that predate those two and a half years.
I've been reflecting on my past and marking the beginning of a significant transition two and a half years ago. I've had conversations with people who have shared their stories and versions of my story, which have shaped my understanding of my history. I don't necessarily look at my past to make changes, but I do recognize the importance of having and retelling that history.
I never thought about it, but that's probably true. I have some very stringent requirements for my close friendships, such as acceptance, understanding, and ability to communicate. Is that something we should talk a little bit about?
I'm focusing mainly on my transition, it's not necessarily about gender stuff, but it's more about physical transitions such as hormones and binding.
Over the past two and a half years, I have undergone a transition and have become a completely different person. I find it interesting to talk to my friends about how I was like back then. I also find that revisiting my history helps me not repeat mistakes.
I think my mom is so passionate about me being a girl that she would be willing to see me sacrifice my happiness. She has made a lot of sacrifices for her happiness, so she thinks everybody should do that. She's in so much pain because of it. Her pain has somehow inspired me to do what makes me happy.
I feel like my mom has been really unhappy and has sacrificed a lot for me and my brothers, always living in the past. I want to break down barriers and help people be more free, which is something she could not do. Can I still find value and meaning in my work to challenge the gender binary and strive for liberation, even if my mom may not come to fully understand my intentions?
I am trying to establish my goals as being valuable to my mom although I don't know how to do it. I am confident of her love and working hard because I think it is something she should be proud of. However, I am not sure what informs her standards and she always pushes me to make a lot of money just like everyone else.
I had a conversation with the counsellor, and I realized that I need to work harder on finding the similarity with my mom. I want to be able to communicate what I'm doing as valuable to her.
I've always been quite loud and my mom has really traditional views about what's right and wrong, especially regarding appearance and attitude. We are not able to find similarities between us, but I find hope when I listen to other people's stories and find similarities with them. I've been thinking for years about how we can find common ground and maintain a conversation together.
I'm having trouble communicating with my mom. We often talk across each other, and I think we both have some similarities that get in the way of understanding each other. She feels that I need to listen more, and while she says she would like to understand my similarities, I'm not sure if that's what she truly means.
I feel like my mom wants me to be a different person. She wants me to be a girl, go to college, focus on school, and live at home. But following her expectations doesn't make me feel happy or fulfilled.
I feel like people often say things like 'I could never do that' or 'you're so brave' when they find out I'm trans. I think they're trying to compliment me, but it sometimes comes across as if they're saying my life is so difficult and they couldn't handle it.
I feel like people think I'm brave for continuing to be myself socially, even when I've been ostracized and disowned by my family. It's hard without my support system, and I feel like a lone wolf.
As a person who transitioned, I am worried about the upcoming Christmas family gathering because half of my family is not aware of my transition. Additionally, I was adopted, which adds more complexity to the situation.
I see my mom circling the idea of openness and progressiveness, being more tolerant towards socially unacceptable things. Over the years, she's become more accepting of gay people and stuff, but the other day, she was talking about prop A and how she doesn't think we should have to govern anything and that's not our business. I feel like she might need a companion in her journey of becoming more open-minded.
I came out as a lesbian when I was 15, and later as trans. My mom initially asked if I could just be a lesbian. She didn't fully support my transition at first, but in the last couple of months, she seems to have come a long way.
Ever since I was younger, my family has been really focused on image. They care about how you dress, how you talk, and how you conduct yourself. I specifically remember my mom telling me at my dad's funeral not to cry or make a scene in front of his friends.
I have realized that a specific memory has been entrenched in my mind, which shows me how significant other people's opinions on me are and how much I should care about them.
I feel like she can't break free from the systems that blind her due to power and gender. Also, I believe she's smarter than she lets on and is pretty progressive for a Chinese-American born in the U.S., but I'm not sure what to make of it.
I have a family member, she was born in 1939 and didn't actually grow up speaking English.
I feel better because I have been accepting changes, moving on, and not holding on to the past. I think it's a sign that I am growing and learning, and I celebrate that change.
Lately, I often doubt myself and the negative voice in my head tells me that I'm not growing or doing the right things. However, when I look back, I realize that I've made good decisions and have put emotional effort into things. It reminds me that I'm still a good person and passionate about what I'm doing, and that I'm okay.
This voice in my head tries to talk me out of things, but when I take stock and look back at where I've been and where I'm headed, I can embrace the chance. It makes me feel good about myself and have faith in my abilities.
I've been struggling with the idea of transition in my life, and I'm trying to look back and see where I've been and where I'm headed.
I haven't told my mother that I carry so much of what she said, her voice and values. But the tricky part is that she always says actions speak louder than words and my interpretation of what she says differs from hers. We used to go to counseling together and it was like pulling teeth.
I don't think my mom understands why I'm transitioning and she believes it's wrong because it doesn't fit with her expectations. She doesn't know the values or meaning behind my actions, and I think we'd need a translator for her to understand the significance and meaning.
As a patient, I wanted to clarify my understanding of being a translator in a conversation - that I am conveying my version of what you are teaching me.
As a patient, I attended AA meetings, but I found some comments to be foolish. I'm tired of people treating us as special or feeling sorry for us due to our disease. The more I read about alcoholism, the more I realize that no one knows exactly what it is. So, I might even say I'm alcohol-dependent until there's a definitive agreement on the subject.
One of the things I didn't like about AA is that they wear it like a badge. There is something to be proud of, but there's nothing to be ashamed of. But you certainly don't do some reverse pride on it. I didn't see any difference between those people and normal people.
I've been thinking about how some methods work for certain people, but not for me. Specifically, it seems like it works for highly religious people who believe in higher powers and miracles. Who do you think these methods worked for?
I am not the type of person who believes some deity will come down and save me anytime I have problems. For me, there has to be a compelling reason for me to feel like it's time to make a change.
I've been thinking that the best thing I could do is just start running again and really work on substituting habits. Instead of trying to get rid of one habit, I find it more effective to replace it with another. However, I sometimes struggle with figuring out what to replace the old habit with, and it can leave me feeling stuck.
I have been getting upset with myself lately, and it's really bothering me. In the past, I joined soccer teams and played with people, and that helped me feel better. I'm thinking of doing the same now.
I was in a program where most people were forced to be there and not on their free will. So, naturally, they were resistant. In order to get through the program, we had to talk, behave, and do certain things to fit in and play the game.
I'm struggling with the idea of quitting cigarettes and alcohol, even though I know it's necessary in order to breathe better. But, I don't want to think about it.
I sometimes feel like I just want to do something without thinking about it. Like, is there any point in overthinking everything?
I've been struggling with procrastination when it comes to daily tasks like brushing my teeth and going to the gym. It feels worse to think about doing these tasks than to just go ahead and do them.
As a patient, I have been thinking about going to sleep, but I cannot fall asleep. I hope that makes sense to you.
As the patient, I feel like when I'm thinking about something or trying to do it, I'm not actually doing it. It's like when I try to go to sleep, but I can't.
I'm struggling with this addiction, and it just feels stupid that I keep on playing into it. It's like with alcohol, I've reached a point where I know it's not worth it anymore, but the addiction persists.
I used to drink all the time, but then I stopped and noticed how much better I felt. Now, I can compare and contrast how I felt when I was drinking and how I feel when I'm clear-headed.
I've been comparing myself with and without a certain thing and noticing the difference in my performance. It only becomes a problem for me when I see its impact on my performance. Other people's opinions don't matter much.
As the patient, I am having trouble understanding your approach towards addiction counseling. I just wonder if sometimes people do not want help or if they sometimes push away from the help being offered to them.
I'm not really sure if I want to change because I don't see much harmful effects of my addiction. I heard that it's progressive and supposed to get worse, but that's just not the case with me. However, I think my addiction to smoking is starting to become a problem as I recently started playing soccer.
I can't breathe because the kids are younger and younger, and they're half my age, twice my size. I'm having a problem with it.
I guess you really know nothing about me, do you? I thought at least they filled you in with some kind or something.
I got a DUI a while back in '93, and I had one prior to that in '85. I'm worried about how this is affecting me and what I should do to avoid future issues.
Lately I've been thinking about how everything in life is predictable and sometimes even negative experiences like bad habits, relationships, and jobs can become addicting because they are familiar.
I think I'm living in a bad area or town, and it's familiar to me. But it's not the terrible change that scares me. As I'm growing older, I know I can't keep up with the young crowd, and I've started saving money in a bank account and even had a college scholarship which I didn't take.
I've always had a bank account and put a lot into it, but I've been withdrawing from it for a long time and the balance is getting low. I think I can only do this for so long before I start feeling the effects, and now I'm not so sure.
I've been feeling really stressed about my finances lately, and I don't want to go into debt. I think it would be helpful to do a follow-up on my financial situation to get a better understanding of my options.
I think it has become important enough for me now to address this issue or else I wouldn't even be thinking about it in the first place. I don't really care about my health but I cannot stand if I'm not the fastest guy out there. I have an identity crisis in that sense, and I'm using my arrogance, conceit, and pride to help me.
I feel like people are too focused on living healthy lives just for the sake of pride and not for their overall well-being. Honestly, I don't really care about it since everyone dies eventually. I'm just tired of people making a big deal out of living forever even though they're not doing what it takes to have a high quality of life.
I think waking up healthy and being able to do what I want would be nice. I would like to do that forever, but I know it's not possible and accept that. For me, it's more about the quality of life than longevity.
I'm coming here today because my friend told me about the study you guys are doing, and as an addiction counselor, he thought I might be an interesting subject. I'm not currently in recovery.
I have been struggling with cigarette addiction, and I used to have problems with alcohol, but that has reduced significantly in the past couple of years. I believe it might be because of changes in my environment.
I feel like I'm not able to keep up with things anymore, and I think it's because I'm getting too old.
I really don't think I can. I really do think that cigarettes are worse for me. In the past, I've done cocaine and even crack cocaine. I've heard it's one of the most addictive drugs, but from my personal experience, I don't find it addictive at all. For me, it's tobacco and alcohol.
Lately, I've been struggling with my addiction to caffeine, especially coffee. I don't know how far I want to go with quitting, but it's been bothering me and affecting my daily life. What should I do?
I have been trying to connect with people who have different IQ levels and personality traits, but I am finding it difficult to do so. I feel like I never really got there and that my interactions are always a bit different.
I'm feeling really anxious about not knowing the outcome of a certain situation, and it's really bothering me.
I went to AA to get my license back, but it didn't work for me. I feel like they have a 'bumper sticker' therapy, like 'fake it till you make it.'
I've been to this place where some guys didn't do anything all day and they didn't drink that day. I'd rather lift weights, build a patio furnace, and program our base before I drink, instead of just not drinking and doing nothing else.
I found that certain aspects of stopping a habit like drinking or smoking work for me, but only when I have a deep-seated religious belief. I want to have an active life and focus on what I'm going to be doing and how I spend my time. I think the best way to quit smoking is to play soccer three times a week.
Lately, I've been facing issues with my breathing, and I think it's because of my smoking habit. But telling myself to quit smoking doesn't seem to work for me.
Previously, I went through mandatory counseling due to some issues with the state. I completed rehab and got my driving privileges back. But, I've had some bad experiences with the counselors, not because they were unprofessional, but because their approach felt very rigid.
I was trying to quit something but I didn't think I was really committed to quitting at that time. I later had another attempt because I was earning good money, but the counselors told me I'm not supposed to be able to quit. I feel a bit confused about what to do.
I've had a strange experience and seem to have a negative attitude about some of the things I've been through with state programs. I don't know how to explain it, but my experience doesn't match what I've been told. They say that I'm an alcoholic, and I need to quit drinking forever.
I feel like I wasn't fitting into the role they wanted me to play.
I feel like my situation doesn't work, it's a copout. I actually wish I was stupid and didn't know any better so I could feel comfortable in this uncomfortable place I am right now.
I find it uncomfortable to move either way, and I become more conscious of taking in the poison or carcinogen, which is becoming a problem for me.
I'm feeling stuck and unsure about my direction in life. I don't want to stay in the same place I'm currently in with friends who are into drinking and smoking. But I'm not sure what I should do or where I should go.
I feel pressured by my friends who give me a hard time about smoking, although they drink a lot. They don't smoke, and they insist that I should quit, but I feel like I would have to quit drinking as well, and they don't seem to support that idea.
I feel like things don't work out for me the way they should. I've been trying to stay away from certain people, but it's hard to establish distance and independence.
I wake up with a hangover and I thought it was because of the alcohol, but it isn't. I realized it's carbon monoxide from the cigarettes.
I've got no oxygen in my system due to cigarettes. Although alcohol is bad, I'm not as worried about it as I am about my smoking, because it's not causing me as many problems.
Lately, I've been waking up after having a six-pack of beer and then trying to work on my programming or play soccer. I find it difficult to be alert and focused during the first two hours of the day.
I've been struggling with drinking lately. My tolerance has gone up so high that it takes too much to get the same buzz, and the recovery is becoming unbearable. It's getting to the point where it's just not worth it. If only I could get the same high as a twelve-pack from just three beers.
I've been feeling stressed lately because I got three ounces to process and it's taking me 12 times more effort to get the same results as before. Now, I've got 12 to process and I'm struggling to find a balance point for measuring returns on ever-expanding quantities.
I quit smoking, and I quit drinking too because I can't drink without having a cigarette. If I drink, I'll end up having a cigarette.
I've noticed that when I drink alcohol, I tend to lose my job. It might be related to my willpower or judgment getting affected. Also, I have associated habits like having coffee and cigarettes.
I find it difficult to resist cigarettes when I am going home, and I have noticed a similar pattern with cocaine and alcohol. There's such an association between these substances for me.
Lately, I've been feeling judged by others when it comes to my drinking habits. I'm curious, do you drink too?
I feel like people often say that alcoholics are different, but I think it's just a physiological reaction to a toxic drug. Everyone's judgment goes down after they consume alcohol, like after having six beers.
Lately, I've been struggling to breathe on the soccer field and it's been quite distressing.
I've been trying to find something to live for, and I read about positive addiction. I used to be a runner and I've noticed that after running, I don't have the desire to drink. I think that many runners might have had drinking problems and running helped them overcome it.
I have very little desire to smoke cigarettes. When I experience endorphins, I feel good and alert. I question why I would want to pollute myself with cigarettes. However, I'm not entirely committed to total abstinence. I'm not sure.
I am committed to quitting smoking so that I can breathe better on the soccer field.
I used to lose respect for people because they were so easy to fool. I read addiction counseling books and found out what the counselors were looking for and just played the game, telling them what they wanted to hear. But I feel like that was really counterproductive, as nothing changes if I'm not genuinely committed to it.
I've been struggling with my emotions lately. I used to think that there was someone outside of me telling me what to do, but now I realize it's my own internal feelings, like my longings and desires, that seem to be guiding me.
I've experienced some physical issues that make me feel like my body is hitting me back for my unhealthy habits. My liver and lungs don't seem to be in their best condition. But I don't know why it's hard for me to stick with a healthier lifestyle, like running.
I get really angry with myself because if I was just stupid, I could forgive myself for my addiction. But if I identify as an 'addict,' I think other people might be able to forgive me too.
I feel angry and I am upset at my ex-husband. It's hard for me to express my feelings and I need help in finding a way to communicate my emotions.
I feel very frustrated about the situation, that my ex-partner, Jeff, has left me and the children in. I don't think he understands how hard it is sometimes and the things I have to explain to the kids about the situation. It bothers me that he doesn't spend more time with the children and I worry that they will resent him for it in the future.
As a patient, I participated in a role-playing activity where I played the role of Jeff. I was trying to see what Jeff could answer in that situation.
I'm feeling the same as before, just a little frustrated at the moment. There's a tight feeling that I have, and it's difficult to put into words, but it doesn't feel good.
I feel a tight and compressing feeling in my chest, specifically around the heart area.
My chest feels very tight. I feel very frustrated, angry.
I'm just accepting the anger that I'm feeling in my chest right now. I realize that it's a part of me, but I often refer to it as 'it', like it's something out there, not within me.
I've been offered something and I'm considering it. I feel like it could be a good idea for my kids' sake. What do you think about this offer?
I think that's something that I could look at, but when I contact you, I don't want you to be short with me or rude. I want you to consider it and be honest. I am aware of the contract happening and I know that the children are important.
I'm worried about the impact of my separation on my children. My partner and I want to come to a mutual agreement on how we're going to take care of our children, but I'm struggling with feelings of anger and frustration. How do I manage these feelings and work together with my partner for the sake of our kids?
I've recently begun attending counseling sessions with a partner who hasn't been participating actively in the process of forming a contract. It's making it difficult for us to navigate the sessions and communicate effectively. What can I do to make the session better?
I've come to a realization that the children need both their father and mother. I think I just need to let him know that and extend the invitation for him to spend more time with us.
I am Sandra and I was asked to have a conversation with an imaginative version of Jeff. I am unclear about what he is saying in this conversation.
I feel like my spouse, Jeff, doesn't want to spend more time with me and the kids. He is always busy with work and other things, which is affecting our family.
I've been feeling frustrated lately because I want to spend more time with my children, but when I try to discuss this with my partner, Sandra, she becomes short and rude. I would like her to be more open to the opportunity.
I am feeling frustrated, angry, and hurt with my ex-husband, Jeff. I don't have any appreciation for him when it comes to our children, because I believe the reason he's involved with them is not genuine.
I feel frustrated with my partner because although we are both busy, I still give our children priority and make them a major part of my life, but he doesn't do the same. I don't think it's right.
I feel like my ex-partner should be more proactive in wanting to see our children. I wouldn't mind if they wanted to see them more than what we have agreed.
I am really good at creating contracts and being clear about what I want, but I am struggling with reaching agreements with the other party in the negotiation process.
I have been trying to resist the negative effects of a particular issue on myself and my children, and I shared my story with the counselor. They were moved and felt a sense of outrage themselves.
As a patient, I have noticed that the difference between people with dark or light skin causes divisions even within a family. This issue has divided children against each other and I recently witnessed it happening with my own children. I'm very disturbed by how powerful this issue is.
I was experiencing the effects of a situation, but I didn't have to fight back. I'm going to be very well dressed and my hair will always be nicely done.
I've been so caught up in trying to reassure my daughter about her beauty and protect her from those powerful stories with long histories that have produced divisions between people, putting them into groups and perpetuating stereotypes.
As a patient, I recently had a moment when I looked in the mirror and had negative thoughts about myself. I have been working on getting past these thoughts, and one way I do that is by dressing in bright colors.
I've been trying to shift my focus by dressing myself up, selecting different clothes, and keeping my hair done. I've been doing this so I can concentrate on other things and not worry about my insecurities like feeling unseen when I wear a black sweater. I hardly wear black shirts now, out of the many shirts I own, I only have one or two black shirts.
I'm aware of certain things and I try harder at a lot of things because I don't want to be thought of as stupid because I'm dark-skinned or for any other reason. I want to be noticed for my efforts and achievements.
I want to not just move the stereotype, but to actually break free from it completely.
I've been labelled based on my appearance and complexion, especially my dark skin. People have said things like 'Oh, you're pretty to be so dark,' which makes me wonder what people expect of dark-skinned individuals. Am I supposed to be ugly and just got lucky?
As a patient, I often hear people say something that feels like they're giving me a compliment but then taking it back. They don't realize it, but it makes me feel like my dark complexion is a disease and that I'm somehow beating the odds by not being ugly because of it.
As a patient: I have been experiencing situations where people make comments about my skin color and race, almost offhandedly, without intending to be hurtful. They say it as a compliment, but I am still affected by it.
I feel like my family taught me a hierarchical system to evaluate people, but when I go out into the real world, I realize that it's not a good lesson. I start to question the teachings when I encounter a situation that doesn't fit the pattern or when an unrelated person points out the issue.
I feel like I'm constantly being categorized into a group instead of being appreciated for who I am as an individual. This has happened quite a few times, and people are always surprised that I don't fit into their preconceived notions of the group they've placed me in. This has made it difficult for me to be who I truly want to be.
I've had quite a bit of negative effects over the years, but because of my personality, I've turned the negative into positive. However, it's like a constant fight, and I always compare it to having a disease.
I feel like my doctor is giving me a really negative outlook, almost as if I'm paralyzed and will never walk again. But guess what, I'm actually walking now.
I often feel judged when I go out to meet new people, and they look at me with surprise or disbelief, as if they didn't expect me to be cool or interesting.
I feel like when I enter a room, my complexion is what people see first. I believe that being dark-skinned automatically means I'm considered dumb, loud, and without much to offer. I have to constantly prove myself to be seen differently. I feel this judgment comes mostly from within my own race.
I've been thinking about the distinctions made among African American people based on complexion, and how it might be influenced by the history of racism, colonization, and family upbringing. In my family, lighter-skinned people are treated better and tend to separate themselves from the darker-skinned family members.
I think there's a kind of code, as I mentioned earlier.
Sometimes, I use creams to lighten my complexion because I know that people are looking at me and thinking negative things because of it. I don't want to be anyone else, but I wish I didn't have to deal with those judgments.
I don't want people to recognize me solely because of the color of my skin. I'd rather they notice something else about me, something completely outside of my complexion, without complimenting or negatively commenting on it.
I don't want people to notice my condition because they don't know much about it and what I go through. I want people to focus on the fact that I'm walking even though I was supposed to be paralyzed.
I sometimes feel like I'm expected to be dark-skinned, ugly, and all those negative things people associate with my complexion. However, I know that I'm not like that, and I want to move past it.
I've been struggling with people labeling me and limiting my identity to just being a black girl without any culture or connections. I found a genealogical story about who I am, and it gives me a sense of belonging outside of just my race.
I've noticed that people from different countries appreciate the diverse features of dark-skinned individuals. This makes them beautiful in their own right. This has played out in my own children as well.
When I first started the program, it came out in a counseling session that I didn't even realize I was treating my kids differently based on their skin color. I have a dark-skinned and a light-skinned child. My dark-skinned child once came home from preschool and told me someone called her ugly and black, which brought up past issues for me. I felt like I needed to make sure she knew she was beautiful, so I always made her wear nice clothes to fight back against the prejudice.
I have been so focused on my daughter with darker skin that I neglected my other child, thinking she wouldn't have any problems. To my surprise, my dark-skinned daughter didn't face any issues, while my other child ended up having problems.
I believe that if I was living in that area, I probably would have been using some kind of bleaching cream too. It gets really heavy on a person to have to deal with that. I felt a connection and compassion for what Michael Jackson was going through.
I have lighter skin friends, and we understand the differences in our experiences. However, some people in the black community think that lighter-skinned individuals believe they're superior to those with darker skin. I wish this issue would just disappear.
I constantly feel the need to prove myself and be recognized for things other than my complexion. I want to change people's stereotypes and show that dark skinned people can be smart and attractive. I know my heritage, as my mom is a genealogist, but I still feel trapped in this box.
I've been trying to cope with my dark skin tone, despite my efforts, sometimes I find it hard to appreciate it and it ends up affecting my relationship with myself.
I feel like my appearance doesn't match the stereotypes of a dark-skinned person, and I hate to say it, but it helps me in some ways. My hair is long, I don't have a large nose, and my lips aren't huge. It's like being paralyzed and walking, and because I'm walking, I go the extra step to run. However, I shouldn't feel this way about myself, but I do.
Sometimes, when I look in the mirror, I feel like I am too dark and feel the need to do things to make myself feel better, but I'm not necessarily trying to lighten my skin.
Lately, I've been struggling with the urge to change my appearance, and I've dyed my hair brown to fight against it. My hair, however, couldn't handle the dye.
I find it really stressful and hard to get myself out of bed in the morning. I eventually force myself to get up because I need to pay the bills and go to work. However, I often lay in bed too long, and then I have to rush around to get ready for work. Sometimes I even skip breakfast because I'm running late.
I have a bit of a commute to work and I drive my car. During my drive, I get really stressed out and I dread going into work. While I'm in the car, most of my thoughts are negative.
I feel like my heart's racing, I'm sweaty and on edge. When I'm driving, I constantly need to do something to calm myself down.
I have been in a long-term relationship, and I recently went through a breakup. I am struggling with adjusting to being on my own and feeling comfortable in this new situation.
Every morning, I wake up at 7:30 and lie in bed thinking about the day ahead. I think about my commute, what I'm going to eat, and some past events. I often wonder how I'm going to make it through the day.
I am sensitive, gentle, and responsive to people. I am also efficient in my life, as when I start something, I like to see it all the way through to the best that I can. It doesn't always turn out that way, but that's what I try and strive for.
I am very serious about setting and achieving my goals. When I look at words like open-minded, patient, resilient, adaptive, good sense of humor, caring, empathetic, thoughtful, adventurous, gentle, sensitive, and efficient, I would say that being adaptive is a core value for me.
Recently, I moved from a different country to America and I had to learn how to be adaptive during this transition. Additionally, I've gone from working a 40-50 hour a week job to having almost no work and being a full-time student.
As a patient, I've been asked by my counselor to participate in an activity where they will ask the same question ten times, and I have to give the best possible answer each time without repeating any of my responses.
I think some of the good qualities about me are that I am open-minded, patient, and resilient.
I believe I have a few good qualities, such as being adaptive, having a good sense of humor, being caring, empathetic, and thoughtful.
I am adventurous, gentle, and thoughtful. But sometimes, I struggle with validating myself and recognizing my positive traits.
I recently ended a four-year relationship, there's talk at work about positions being moved around, and I'm trying to drink less. I'm feeling overwhelmed lately and sometimes find it hard to get out of bed.
I just tried to reflect on the person that I am now as opposed to the person that I was, you know, a while ago. I was focusing on being here now and who I am, and can I give you a list of things about myself that really capture who I am?
As a patient, I am feeling thoughtful because sometimes it takes me a while to sit down and think about something in order to come out the way I'd like it to. I tend to overthink, but I guess that also makes it true.
I'm Omar, and I've come in for counseling. I want to discuss my life situation and the reasons behind seeking help, but haven't disclosed the specifics yet.
I would say that what feels normal to me is being content and less stressed. I could definitely use more calmness in my life and not feel as edgy.
As a patient, I struggle with getting up in the morning and I feel like I have to force myself to do it. I want to feel contented and calm and know that getting up has to happen.
I struggle with getting up in the morning and feel overwhelmed by work stress. I feel like my workplace is out of control and my position is insecure. I guess I need help not worrying about it too much and finding some hope.
I've been feeling overwhelmed with worry about the future and I'm looking to develop some positive hope. I want to try to reduce the worry and replace it with something more positive.
One thing that makes me feel good is knowing that I actually got to where I needed to be on time and turned in my work. This gives me a sense of accomplishment and relief.
I feel safe on the road, stick to my lane, and try to reach my destination as quickly as possible. At work, we have a meeting every time I get there, which makes me apprehensive. After work, I just can't wait to get back home and lay down. I find relief in going home, laying down, and not having to deal with crazy drivers or my coworkers or deadlines.
I feel worried throughout the day and I don't have much appetite. I lay around, watch TV, and go to bed, but there's always a lot of worry. There's only a brief moment when I feel a little better, and that's when I get to work.
I've had this pattern of drinking too much, especially during stressful times. I don't want to end up like some people in my family who have had similar issues. Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and find it hard to get up in the morning.
I am feeling stressed due to the uncertainty at work, as there's talk of my position being removed because of a management shift. It has caused a lot of worry since I need to make my payments and bills. Moreover, since my divorce, I only have half of the resources that I used to have.
I often feel overwhelmed with stress, and it's hard for me to deal with it. If this overwhelming feeling went away, I think I would feel normal, whatever that means.
I want to go out and socialize, but I'm afraid of people asking me how I'm doing or about my divorce. I feel like it's safer to just stay at home.
I struggle with finding authentic connections in my life, and the only friend who truly makes me feel alive lives an hour away from me.
I'm finding it hard to connect with my sister as much as I would like. She's an hour away but it feels like we're more distant than that. We do talk on the phone often.
I have been having conversations on the phone with a friend, and we laugh a lot during those calls. We both have busy schedules, so we only get to talk about two or three times a month. I really need those laughs.
I find energy that I didn't know was there and before I know it, I feel alive. I think that what broke my heart has opened up a path, brought me to something that brings me joy, keeps me connected, breaks the isolation of other women, and gives me a sense of purpose.
I have this talent and I want to find a way for it to help me get some finances but I don't have a degree or anything, and I've never placed a price on my time.
I've been struggling a bit lately, and I just came across something that truly lights me up. I like the idea of being able to guide and help women find themselves again. It would have a lot of meaning for me.
I think from my youth I imagined myself financially independent, but I also imagined myself as accomplishing something and that's the missing peace. Right now, it would be taking something that broke me, putting it back together, and then helping other broken people get fixed.
I have been informally helping people who reach out to me for support. I share my story with them, and it feels good to help others. However, I never thought of turning this into something more formal.
I live for the moments when I'm with my kids, feeling joy and connection, laughing together, and taking care of them. However, when I'm worried about my son or my finances, or not feeling fulfilled in my work, I feel less connected and more alone.
I have been feeling lonely lately, especially after my divorce. I miss the connection and companionship I used to have. Aging has also made me feel more vulnerable to losing people in my life. I wish I could recreate the warmth and connection I experience during Christmas in my everyday life.
People get disconnected and isolated, and I'm a person that likes other people. But it's hard for me because I'm so exhausted at the end of the day that when I get invitations to go places, I find excuses not to go.
I find it so easy to come up with reasons not to do things, and I'm always just so tired. I want to be able to explain to others why I'm feeling this way.
These days, my adult son is living in LA and I'm helping him financially, even though he is quasi-independent. He's been coming up short on rent this month, which is unusual.
I'm Donna, and I've been facing some issues with my adult child who keeps asking for financial support to pay his rent. If I don't help him, he might get kicked out of his place.
I feel worried about my adult son, who might get kicked out and want to come back to live with me. This would make both of our lives miserable. He cannot ask his father for help, and this situation is putting pressure on me.
I am a mother who finds joy and fulfillment in being a mom. Lately, my adult son has been facing some financial pressures, and I have been helping him occasionally with money for transportation like Uber when I can.
I've had a rough week with things being tough at work, and I'm tired. I had to give my son money for rent, which forced me to Uber to work since I don't have a working car. I also have to take dinner to my parents, and I feel like a hamster in a wheel, with no way out. I never thought I'd be in this situation, alone and carrying everything by myself.
I'm not used to focusing on myself and whenever I think about it, my heart feels uneasy. I have elderly parents and I don't know what slowing down means.
I became a partner in a business, and my life changed dramatically. Additionally, I have an adult child with needs, so I often revert to my mom role and make sacrifices.
I've been struggling with asking for help and finding a balance in my life. It's hard for me to envision a more pleasurable young elder-hood.
I feel scared about the changes that will happen in my relationship with my son as he becomes more independent and doesn't need me as much as a mother.
I feel scared and lost at the thought of my husband not needing me anymore. If he doesn't need me, then who am I? I've no clue who I want to be at this stage of my life.
Right now, I can't imagine anything different. I feel broken. My marriage and identity were broken, and financially, I went from being comfortable to suddenly struggling.
I am feeling scared as I am moving towards retirement, and I am worried about having to reposition financially.
I feel like I'm physically and emotionally launched, but I'm still facing financial stress and worrying about my elder-hood and the resources I need for that.
I'm struggling with the financial instability caused by my divorce. I'm in my 60s, and I never expected to be in this situation. I don't want to give up my role as a generous and loving mom, but the financial stress is taking a toll on me.
I am going through a major change in my life and it's not what I had envisioned. I am really mad at my ex-husband because we wouldn't be in this situation if he hadn't left us for another woman. Now, my son needs help and I want to show him love and be the better parent.
I've been feeling really hurt lately, and I think it's all because of him. I feel like this pain is affecting the rest of my life, and it's his fault.
I have always been helping others, but I realized that I haven't been asking for what I need in life. I want to start doing that, but I'm not sure how.
I feel like I'm unable to pursue my dreams as a physical therapist because I don't have the money and my brain can't function at the level needed for the courses. However, I'm not sure if this is my true passion.
As a patient, I believe there's a part of me that wants to help other women whose husbands have left them. I've been considering becoming a counselor because it excites me more than my current profession as a physical therapist.
I've been thinking about getting training for a new career that has more passion and meaning for me. I have little experience in this field, and I know how disorienting it can be, but I believe it could potentially bring me more financial security and possibly joy.
I have been struggling to feel joy lately, even though it's a word that I know. The last time I remember feeling it was during Christmas when all of my kids came home.
I feel like I don't fit in, and my thoughts are crowded. I feel like I don't have the space I need to grow.
It feels good to hear you say that, almost validate what's kind of been a hidden feeling. I just didn't give place to it. My kids have been well trained to come to me, but I would like to have some time for myself, like talking to my friends, getting support, or just sitting quietly.
I've been trying to remake my life and recently pulled a card from the elder good deck. I feel unsure about what the card means and how it might relate to the changes I'm making.
I've been hesitant to ask for help from a loved one because I fear being a burden, but I guess she would be willing to support me if she knew I was going through a hard time like experiencing a loss.
I have a lot of pressures trying to make sure my kids are okay in the world. I'm adjusting to being the mother of an adult and I also have a 15-year-old at home. On top of that, I have to take care of my aging parents.
I've been struggling with the idea of aging and figuring out where I'm at in my life right now. Calling myself an 'elder' doesn't feel right to me.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit insecure about my appearance, but I'm trying to remind myself that I still look good and have my health.
I have a family with members that I love, but I often think about whether I made the right choices in picking them. I struggle with negotiating with my teenage child, and I often think about what I need in my family. I also have adult kids who are trying to find their footing in difficult situations.
I've been feeling unfulfilled after being a full-time wife and mom for many years. I had set aside some of my personal desires and aspirations, like going back to school.
I wanted to be a physical therapist and a teacher, and I had the chance to home school my kids. But now that they're grown, I'm working at a healthcare facility for seniors, just to bring in some money, but it doesn't fulfill me. I want it all to go back to school for physical therapy.
I haven't been to school in over 50 years, and I'm worried about the finances involved and my ability to remember school stuff and writing. My fears are screaming really loudly.
I've been thinking about reasons and excuses lately. I feel like excuses are ways to run away from something, but a reason is a valid statement of a truth.
I used to feel trapped in sadness, but after discussing my situation with you, I feel like there's an escape hatch. It's like I can turn my heartbreak into something meaningful and even potentially profitable.
I don't want this experience to take away my strength, I want to repurpose it in a way that it strengthens me and other people. But I'm not sure how to do that or what my next step should be.
I was feeling low on energy and unsure about my possibilities, but after discussing with you, I feel better and realize that I have more potential than I thought. However, I am concerned about the hard work and boundary setting that I need to do.
I am working on sharing more with my friends and getting better at asking for what I need. I plan to call a close friend and ask her to be my buddy in this journey since it could benefit her too.
I only get to see my friends during classes, so it's the rest of the day that I'm frustrated with - other things going on with my other classes. I think I want to do well and my frustration level is at a two.
I was on the math team in eighth grade and I know that's the path to get into college. I still want to do well, so I keep going to class even with everything going on.
I've been feeling very alone lately, and it seems like everyone is against me. But when I think about it, I do have people on my side who care. I respect the seniors, and they don't make me feel isolated.
I'm a senior, and I don't think other seniors care much about the things that are popping up. I'm trying not to care about what they say.
Well, I guess if it doesn't matter to those people then it shouldn't matter to me. But I think it still does a little bit. Yeah. Well, and that's just-- I mean, just cuz it keeps happening, I think it's just continuing to happen. I don't know. Ah, I just kinda think more like, like I said, my friends are seniors, it's just, ah, kind of being like.
I still talk to my mom and I have a couple of close friends. Going to classes with them and talking to them helps me. They don't participate in any negative online activities like on Facebook.
I feel hurt by the things people say about me online and in school. It's hard to see the consistency of those negative comments. It feels like everyone is making fun of me and not on my side.
I think my mom, friends and my math teacher from eighth grade would all say that whatever anyone is writing about me is ridiculous. My math teacher helped me a lot and she was the one who got me to think differently and explore other areas in life.
I feel frustrated and hurried at school. I can't really relax, and I'm always trying to get to class as fast as possible to avoid a certain group of people. Even people I don't know seem to know me, and it's really hard for me. So, I just try to get where I need to go very quickly.
I feel like I'm hiding and trying to rush through school. Sometimes it can feel really horrible; I'd say I'm at a 2 out of 10. But I still go, even if not to all classes, and I enjoy participating in band and theater.
I really like being in the band at school because I can be around a different group of people who don't know me well enough to laugh at me or judge me. I feel like I can just blend in with this more mature group of students and not worry about any negativity from my peers.
Lately, I have been feeling like people are talking about me and picking on me in class. I have been trying techniques to cope with these feelings but I need some advice to improve my situation.
I think counting would mean that somebody cares about me and I matter to them. In my life, for example, I think Ms. Jones is upset that I am not as involved or doing the things that she saw me do last year. So I guess I matter to her.
Lately, I've been struggling with negative feelings and my teacher, Ms. Jones, is worried about me. She said I am bright and that I matter, but I still feel down. Can you suggest an activity to help me focus on something positive?
I was sitting at my computer, typing, and I remember one time I just got fed up with it and decided to shut my computer.
Well, yeah, cuz I didn't wanted-- I mean, I was having a really good day, that was after our competition, and then I just didn't want to ruin it, so I just closed the computer.
I still go to school despite everything, and I have a plan for myself to finish and go to college. I don't want to get back at those who hurt me, as I believe it takes courage not to seek revenge.
I think being capable means being able to do something good or take some initiative. I do get good grades, and I always know the answer.
I feel connected because I think being in touch with people or, you know, something that keeps you striving to do something and connected, I think, yeah, it just means like you want to be involved. I have a great connection with my mom and my sisters, and I find it to be a positive thing for me.
I think my mom is overreacting. I brought home a not-so-great report card and she freaked out. My grades aren't great, and I don't like my math class because the kids aren't nice. I used to be good at math, but now they make fun of me for being smart, so I stopped participating.
I have been feeling really frustrated lately because there are some things that have been popping up online about me, and people have been saying things about me in the hallway too.
I've been feeling like a target and it's really upsetting me. I've found that shutting the computer and walking away helps, as well as talking to my friends and my mom. But I haven't told my mom about everything that's been going on.
I've been trying to give my friend a bit of information about my situation, so she can understand what I'm going through and not be upset with me. I can talk to her about it.
When I talked to my mom about my problems, she didn't seem to understand much about the internet. I think she needs someone to teach her about what's going on online. I also find it helpful to talk to my friends and focus on my future.
I've been feeling down and struggling with school lately. I haven't been attending classes, and I'm sure my teachers have noticed.
I have been struggling with people who constantly pick on me, and it's frustrating. I don't believe in revenge and it's not part of my value system, but I don't know what to do about this situation.
In the past few weeks, I've been struggling with an issue that has been causing me significant distress. However, I found the strength to shut the computer and walk away from it. I feel a bit better now, but I'm not sure how I can help someone else going through the same thing.
Recently, I've been feeling like I don't want to be seen much or draw any attention to myself because I just want to stay out of the way, which is not how I used to be.
I feel powerful sometimes, but other times I feel angry and powerless, like there's nothing I can do about it.
I don't feel very powerful, and I don't feel like I can stop what's going on. I'm not getting positive attention, and that's taken away some of my power. But I do have friends, my mom, and Ms. Jones who likes me.
I am concerned about my senior friends, especially those in band, as we will be graduating soon.
I feel that when I'm happy, I walk slower, stand up straight, and smile. I think happiness makes me feel lighter and more confident. But, lately I've been feeling a lot of worry and negative emotions that I would like to replace, as they're affecting me at school.
I was asked by the counsellor to choose a color representing a feeling that I have when I'm at home. I chose the color pink.
I chose pink to represent the excitement I feel when I think about going home. I love my house and being there with my family. We also go on lots of trips, which is something I look forward to and enjoy.
Lately, I've been feeling really sad and inadequate because of people posting hurtful things about me. They just see me as a joke, and it feels like I don't matter to them.
I guess, just, ah, I mean, I'm involved in a lot of things or I used to be so, - you know, I'm-- I can do the band and, and math and theater and all those things so I guess that's I think an interesting mix, those things.
I feel embarrassed because I am getting a lot of negative attention. Some people only know me for the bad things that are happening in my life. It's not the same as before when I used to get positive attention for being on the math team and doing well.
Today, I came across something I didn't want to deal with and it could have ruined my good day, so I just shut my computer and didn't look at it anymore.
I didn't let a bad situation ruin my day recently, and I was able to shut my computer and walk away. Also, I find that spending time with my friends and going out with them has been really helpful.
I think I've just been able to think about the future, I guess think about the time when it might not happen anymore. So, I'm just kinda waiting for that time to come.
I am a patient, and I mentioned that focusing on my priorities might help in my progress. I asked the counsellor if there are any other feelings to share when we're online. I want to move the negative feelings out of the way and then read some words on cards to discuss their meaning.
I want to know how revenge fits in with the emotions we discussed earlier. I think it takes courage and strength not to retaliate against people who make me feel bad, but I'm not sure which emotion it aligns with the most.
Lately, I've been feeling a sense of inadequacy, like I don't matter to anyone or have any worth. This feeling is making me sad and upset. Can you help me understand why I feel this way?
Every time I feel comfortable, I know that the next day is going to be pretty bad. I lose all those feelings of being comfortable, and then I go into dread again, which makes me really upset. I would say my control over the sadness when I'm at home is at a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10.
Well, sometimes I just don't look at it. I mean, I just won't look at Facebook. Because I do want to be connected, that's where everyone talks about things and posts pictures, but sometimes I just don't want to look at it because I don't want it to ruin my day. You know, ruin my night at home and I just try to ignore it, but then I hear it in the hallways.
Lately, I've been able to just go off and forget about my problems. I think I have something in me that helps me to cope by being able to walk away like that. However, I still have other feelings at home that I'm unsure about.
I don't think it's fair what they're doing to me, and I struggle to explain my feelings. I haven't retaliated and I'm trying not to get angry. I've been talking to my mom about it, and she keeps saying 'this too shall pass'.
I feel really hurt and I've been having some emotions at school that are bothering me. I haven't lashed out, but it's just really painful. Talking to my mom helps somewhat. The main problem is happening when I'm on Facebook. It feels like a tornado inside.
I feel embarrassed a lot of the time online because of seeing certain pictures, captions, and comments from people. It makes me feel shamed and brings me down.
I get angry at school because of the frustration from a group of girls who constantly try to bring me down in class. I'm new to high school and didn't go to junior high with these girls, so I don't know them well. They didn't like that I knew the answers in class and called me a school girl. I used to enjoy being good at something, like math, but they make me not want to be good at it.
I've been trying to be okay with being called a school girl, but it's tough when people share it with everyone and they say things about me in the hallways. Some people I don't even know know my name and say things to me. It's upsetting how a small group gets something started and it continues growing.
I don't try to post anything about the people who make me angry. They make me angry, but I don't go after them or anything. I don't think that would be right.
Lately, I've been trying to reach a level of maturity like other people and not worry too much about things. However, when I'm online, I feel worried and scared of what I might see.
I've been dreading looking at social media because stuff gets spread really fast and it becomes really mean. This worry and fear of seeing what's on there is causing me other emotions.
I think to move up to a two with that emotion, it's kind of like the hurt one. It's just trying to get above it, I guess. Trying to make it not as important.
I still think those things can affect me, even though I try not to think they're important. They do hurt, and I get nervous about what I'm going to see. I'm trying to make it less of a worry.
I've been so worried about the future and found that people in the support group can be overwhelming with their displays of affection. However, I'm feeling more positive about the one day at a time approach. Will you be my counselor?
This morning was rough, and I wish they had let me sleep a bit more. But I'm feeling better now. I guess for the rest of the day, I'll have lunch, hang out with David, maybe talk a bit, and then fill out that assessment package you gave me. David also mentioned some meetings he goes to, so I might attend those, although I won't be hugging anyone or anything like that.
I feel like some of the questions are stupid and I want to give false answers to a few of them. Is it okay if I do that for about five questions and be honest with the rest?
I guess I've been scared before, but not about this situation. When I was a little kid, I was scared of the dark. In my drug career, stuff never really scared me. The only thing that worried me was being homeless, but I always knew I could go back home, so it was never too bad.
I never really felt afraid of getting arrested when it happened because I was so jacked up, but now I don't know what's coming around the corner.
I've been trying to take things one day at a time, but it's hard. I've been learning to make changes and face my fears, and I want to change how I talk to my parents. I think they'll believe me, but I was wondering if you could possibly talk to them as well.
I'm worried that I might not be taken seriously and feel like I'm being hung out to dry. I understand that it's fair to be observed for a couple of weeks, but I'm concerned about my performance during this time.
I am willing to think about it and write it down, but I'm scared to see them now that we're talking about this.
I'm scared because I feel like they won't believe me, and I won't be able to fake them out, especially in this new program. I want to be a part of it, but it's also a little scary.
I'm scared, I'm scared ****less. To be honest with you.
I've been feeling scared lately because if I don't change this time, I don't have anywhere to go. I've never seen the situation this serious before.
I've been noticing my roommate, David, who has been here for about 30 days. He seems to be doing alright, talking in the groups and stuff. But I'm not sure if he's being genuine or just bullshitting. I'm not sure if that's part of the recovery process.
I've been struggling with bull crapping too much, and I just want to lessen it. I caught myself doing it twice today. Can you suggest a way to reduce this habit?
I feel like the counselors are always just telling me what to do and talking, without really understanding my situation.
I've been told that I need to go to meetings and get a sponsor, specifically AA meetings.
I feel really out of place with the new schedule change. It seems like everyone else is already used to waking up early, but I just went through detox and am struggling with the adjustment. Am I the odd one out? Should I just try to get on board and adapt to the change?
Lately, I've been waking up really early, like at 6:00 AM. I don't think I've ever gotten up that early before, and it seems a bit unusual for me.
I don't know if anyone has ever really tried to help me. I'm 19 and I've already been through three programs since I was 16, and I don't want to do this again.
My family has been acting differently towards me lately. They've never done this before - slamming doors, hanging up the phone, and even my grandma won't talk to me. It has been two months since they last talked to me.
I have been here for two days, and this is my first time meeting with a counselor. I am a little nervous and sweaty, and this whole situation is not quite what I had in mind.
I recently moved to a new place and I'm finding it nicer than the last one I was at. I didn't expect there to be so many people around, especially people my age, like 19.
This is my third time here, and it's not so bad. The only thing I really dislike about this place is that the food kind of sucks.
I don't really like the food here and the restrictive hours, but honestly, I don't want drugs anymore. I'm done with that.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with my daily routine. It's difficult for me to wake up at 8:30 in the morning and I'm forced to go for a walk which I don't particularly enjoy.
As a patient, I didn't provide much information, but I said 'Thanks' to my counsellor after they mentioned they will see me tomorrow.
I feel like my family does not want to hear anything from me or even talk to me. Do you think you could convince them to come for a family group session and listen to what I have to say?
I didn't think I was talking to my family. It was like a different person.
I am concerned about my family situation, especially with my brother. I'm surprised to hear that you will try to bring him in for a session. He's in college and we barely talk these days.
Lately, I've been feeling really disconnected from my family. They used to be very supportive, but now it feels like they've stopped caring or talking to me. I would like to reconcile and have a better relationship with them.
I feel like my family exaggerates my behavior. They say I never do anything for them and that I don't care about them anymore. I help sometimes, like when I helped my dad with the car. But they still believe that I never do anything.
I feel like my parents are constantly saying things to me and then backing down. I think they're really serious this time, but it's difficult to know for sure because of their past behavior.
I feel frustrated when people hang up on me during phone calls. I want them to talk to me instead, but I don't know how to make that happen.
I'm feeling scared to share my feelings with a big group, and I don't want to admit that I'm scared. Can't I just talk to you instead of the group?
I'm not going to hug them in the recovery group. I feel like they would think I'm funny if I say I don't want to.
I met my counsellor today and I was a bit nervous during our conversation. My hands were sweating while we were talking, and I mentioned that they cause me to feel a bit embarrassed when shaking hands. I also told them that I find the counselling sessions a bit scary.
I've been feeling kind of nervous lately, especially in situations where I don't know the other person well. I tend to worry about getting yelled at or put down even though people typically don't act that way towards me.
I recently had a confrontation with someone who didn't yell at me, but it still made me really nervous and sweaty. It's bothering me that I reacted this way.
I want to change and I have made some changes already, but I'm afraid because at my last treatment center, they kept saying everyone fails and the success rate was one out of ten. And I'm thinking, even if I really want help, what's the point if the success rate is so low?
I've been struggling with understanding why people act in certain ways, and I've thought for years that you can't change it. But now, I'm starting to believe that maybe I can change things.
I've been told that I should take things one day at a time, and I guess I agree. I have a group session this afternoon and I'm not sure what to do when I walk in there. Can I tell them about what we talked about?
I'm trying to assure my parents that I'm committed to my recovery from addiction, but I'm worried they won't believe me. I want to take it one day at a time, and I don't plan on going back to my old habits. But I can't promise them I'll never do that again.
As the patient, I role-played as my father and asked my son if he could promise not to engage in a harmful behavior again. In response, he said he'd take one day at a time and live by the philosophy 'just for today'. My dad would be really impressed if he heard my son say that.
I don't know what taking one day at a time means, but I'm here today. Last time, I just kept thinking about how to get out, but today, I'm not really thinking about how to get out. It's kind of surprising and weird.
I figured I would already be trying something, I mean, maybe it's because I know that my parents are done talking, it's like, last time I'd go to the payphone, I'd sneak out and call them, but they'd always take be back.
Today, I got up at the right time, made my bed, did the morning chores, and completed the community job. I also pitched in and made my own breakfast.
I went to a group session and actively participated. I was honest about my feelings and experiences. Although I have just started seeing a couple of groups, it seems like people are talking about their struggles and what they need to do. I think I should also talk about my goals, like getting a job back.
I have been participating in a group therapy, and I am not sure if I am making any progress. I have been sharing some light-hearted thoughts, but I am not sure if that's what they want to hear. I am considering writing a letter or talking about how I can be a better son, brother, or friend.
As a patient, I've never had a counselor tell me it's alright to bull crap a little bit. They're always like, telling me it's character this, and you're a liar...
I haven't laughed in a while, but I feel good now that I'm laughing and talking with you. I haven't been feeling this way before I came in here.
I haven't laughed in a long time, but I recently did without the need for drugs. I'm just kind of worried about having different counselors and if they'll be as cool as you.
I'm struggling with my relationship with my family. It's pretty bad right now and I want it to be better.
I'm just going to need help, I don't know what to do.
I recently reached out for help and was told to come talk to you. It's a new experience for me to admit that I need help, but I'm here now, trying to understand and work through my issues.
I guess I need help with this since I’ve been involved with drugs and have been through a lot. I know all the lingo, but I still need assistance to deal with it.
I really want to do it this time, but I don't know how to. I now realize that I can't just bull my way through it.
I feel guilty for having certain emotions because my family sacrificed a lot when they moved from Colombia. We lost our identity and family dynamics, and my parents had to struggle with documentation. It's hard to connect to my emotions or think further about it.
As a child, I was exposed to a different atmosphere when visiting my family in Columbia. There was a lot of affection, hugging, kissing, and closeness that I never experienced at home. It was a shock because it was so different from what I'm used to, but I really loved it and wished I had it in my own family. Now, my family is not as affectionate but we still love each other.
I know I create lines of communication with my parents, and they'd be open, but I wish they would reach out more. I'm scared to initiate that, and I feel isolated in that part of my life.
I feel there was a big weight kind of dropped from my shoulders. Umm… there was like a lot inside me that has to come out and I was able to start really seeing that, just kind of exhaling. Just a lot of the keywords that you used to describe my feelings kind of hit it right on the nail, so it helped me clarify a lot of what I’m feeling.
I feel the sadness at times, and it comes and goes. I try to deal with it and work through it so I don't get deeper into this hole. I've talked about this on a surface level with friends, but I haven't gone too deep. I don't want to burden them, even though I know they're willing to listen to me.
Lately, I've been feeling so much pressure, like I'm about to explode. I'm just so tired, and I don't allow myself to experience these feelings. When I start feeling them, I just push them away. Sometimes, I dwell on missed opportunities from my past and feel ungrateful.
I feel lonely at times because many of my friends are starting families and there's a lot of pressure. My parents know that I'm gay, but they still expect me to have someone. My family in Colombia mostly doesn't know about my sexuality, and they want me to follow a certain timeline. I think I also put pressure on myself.
I struggle with communicating with my family, especially since they don't know about my sexual orientation. They expect me to follow the traditional timeline of having a girlfriend and getting married. This pressure increased when my younger brother brought his girlfriend to meet them. I feel responsible for not meeting their expectations.
Hi, for the past two years, I've felt this pressure to settle down and do things that my friends are doing, like getting married and having kids. I'm 25, turning 26 soon, and sometimes I feel alone because I'm unsure whether I'll go down that path, especially being gay and considering adoption.
I have been receiving wedding invitations from my friends, who are all heterosexual couples. Every few months, I get excited for them, but at the same time, I feel like I'm falling behind.
I feel a lot of pressure seeing all my friends getting married and following this timeline, which revolves around a traditional heterosexual relationship. I also feel like I should be settling down or having a child, as it is what my parents expect. They know I'm gay but we don't talk about it, and sometimes I feel disappointed.
I have never really discussed my mom's friendship with her ex, but they remained friends and we had a good relationship. No one ever asked me how I really felt about the situation, even years after the fact.
I feel pressured when my parents ask me about my personal life. We don't really talk about emotional things in our family, and it has been like this for the past 25 years. It's difficult for me to open up.
I'm feeling a bit uneasy about something, but I don't think it's a big deal.
I am the oldest child in my family, and I feel like I've been robbed of my childhood. I didn't have the same experiences as my friends because my family immigrated here with nothing, and my parents worked all the time, leaving me to care for my younger siblings. I've become a fatherly figure to them, being tough on them and protective. Sometimes, I wish I could have just been a kid and relaxed more.
I wish I had a closer relationship with my parents. We have a good relationship, but we don't communicate well, and I haven't told them about my sexual orientation. I'm out but I've never told them because I don't feel like I had to and I feel uncomfortable bringing it up. My only relationship was with my ex-partner, who pushed me to reconcile with my family.
I feel like my friends are my family, but there are some parts of my life they can't really understand, especially the part about being gay. I feel isolated because they can't provide the emotional relationship with a partner that I'm missing.
I feel isolated in relationships and with friends. I don't know if it's because I'm gay or if it's just me. I feel constant pressure when I see my friends having partners, and I don't have one. I want that romantic love story where I just bump into someone and hit it off, but it seems like I have to work so hard for it. I can't really distinguish if it's being gay or just my personality.
You know and umm… and it just… and it just makes you feel very lonely at times. And I mean like you can… you can be surrounded by many people in the world and like half of my friends and… and my family, so it’s not physically lonely but…
I wish I had better communication with my family, especially my parents. I find it difficult to talk to them about my relationships. My brother, on the other hand, can easily discuss his relationship with his girlfriend with them. When I brought my boyfriend home, my family didn't talk about it, whereas they openly discussed my brother's girlfriend when he brought her home for the first time.
Oh yeah, when he came back, we liked her, she is great, she is really nice and stuff like that. But with John, it was different. My ex was gone, but that part was another thing like he was gone, so my family had this pleasure. I mean the language barrier made it hard for them to communicate, and they liked his company. We spent a lot of time together, but we never really talked about getting married or anything like that.
I'm missing something in my life and it makes me feel guilty and ungrateful. I believe I've had a good life overall, but sometimes I can't help but think about these things. It's a weird and crazy feeling.
I feel emotionally isolated and left out, which makes me wish I had received more emotional support growing up. I think this feeling has also affected my financial situation.
I feel like I am surrounded by mostly heterosexual friends, I would say about 95% of them are, and only a few of my recent friends are different.
I felt better this week because of the presentation and it really helped. I'm not saying it was great, but compared to the past and my appraisal, it was better this week.
Last week, I watched the tape of my previous therapy session as part of my homework. Can you now help me set the agenda for today's session, and then towards the end, guide me on what lessons we may have learned from this session and set further homework?
I watched the video of myself with my husband. It was really hard to watch and listen to myself. But, it made my husband realize how serious my situation is and how difficult it is for me to attend various functions and do my job. He also reminded me of some of the things you had said.
As a patient, I am here to learn and understand more about my issues and how I can cope with them. I am willing to listen and apply the lessons in my life.
I get really nervous and uptight sometimes, and when I do, I tend to focus on things that go along with that feeling. I end up excluding other things, and I can only remember the bad things about a situation.
I realized during our conversation that I've been editing out the positive things and focusing more on the negative ones. I forgot about this until we started talking, and I guess that makes my postmortem analysis of situations quite inaccurate.
I've been struggling with negative thoughts about my past experiences, and I'm finding it difficult to see these situations in a different perspective.
I had a busy and testing week, and I experienced troubling symptoms in some areas, but not too much. I remembered our previous session and tried really hard during my presentation to look at all the audience members, which was a bit helpful.
During my childhood, I always felt like I was expected to run myself. My sister had problems in her teenage years, so my parents focused a lot on her. My brother also needed extra attention because of a serious accident when he was a child. I feel things were a bit unfair because I didn't get the same attention from my parents as my siblings.
I feel like it was unfair because I didn't receive much positive acknowledgement. A lot of assumptions were made about me achieving, but nobody recognized how hard I had to try. The sibling group was very competitive, and I was at the bottom of the hierarchy in age and other aspects.
Growing up, my parents seemed to favor my siblings over me. It was always implicit, but now that they're older, they've explicitly admitted their favoritism. I feel like I was expected to run myself and sometimes, I just feel like I'm not lovable.
I just have this image of myself standing there looking stupid in situations where other people might be around, looking at me and possibly thinking negatively about me. I feel extremely self-conscious.
I feel like I have a fear of looking foolish or being seen as stupid and being laughed at. I realized this issue about a year ago during a less busy time in my life, like during the summer holidays. I believe my workplace plays a significant role in this fear, it's probably the biggest part of it.
I've been waking up early in the morning feeling very nervous about meeting the people I work with. It gets to the point that I would do anything to avoid it. At night, I tend to think about all the things I got wrong the day before and what I could have or should have said, making me feel even more nervous by morning.
I've been playing cards regularly with my immediate neighbors, Mike and Silvia, and it goes quite well when it's just the four of us.
I've been receiving birthday cards from someone whom I believe to be genuinely trying to make me feel good, but in hindsight, I think there could have been better ways for them to help me.
I recently realized that my mom was trying to help me, but her efforts didn't have the intended effect. I later went on a school trip and met a girl from another class.
During my schooling, I didn't have a friend that I sat and talked to during lesson times. Instead, I made a new friend in another class, and we focused on lessons during school and our friendship was outside of school.
I've been struggling with anxiety, especially during presentations and now it's spilling over into other areas of my life as well. For instance, I have a business function to attend on Monday evening with my husband, and I really don't want to go.
I'm feeling pressured to attend social events with my partner, even though I don't want to go. It's starting to affect my social life negatively. I'm not required to speak or perform, but I feel like I have to say the right things.
I feel anxious in social situations, especially in formal settings where I believe people are making judgments about me. I've attended parties and dinner parties, but I enjoy them less recently. When hosting at my house, I prefer to stay in the kitchen so I don't have to be around everyone. 
I wouldn't go into a pub because I just feel not to do. I wouldn't know what to order or how to act.
I usually tend to leave a situation first in order to avoid feeling left behind. Now, as we are going to be in different areas, I want to make this a good ending. I like the idea of arranging a phone call instead of a formal meeting to help me stay on track, what are your thoughts?
I used to think that I might have difficulty trusting you and feeling safe enough to talk. But, I'm surprised to find out that I actually trust you a lot. However, there's still a part of me thinking that I might not be able to trust like this again after finishing our sessions.
It is strange because I know we've only met four times, but I felt really sad because having somebody well I listen and there was something's that you said that had really shocked me as to how much I understood, you know you understood me and that… that was a real shock and this paused me really like that I thought somebody knew me. So I feel quite sad that you know it is going to end.
I don't think I do endings particularly well in my life. The endings I've had made me feel deserted and left behind. I find it difficult to end things without someone getting hurt.
I feel left out at work because it seems like my coworkers never start conversations with me. They greet and interact with each other, but I never get the same level of attention. For example, my coworker Linda used to have coffee with me, but she doesn't anymore.
Recently, I noticed a change in Linda's behavior and I think it could be related to me working more often.
I am feeling upset because my coworkers don't seem to like me. They never invite me to any gatherings or social events. Silvia, for example, never came over for tea or coffee.
Lately, I've been feeling uneasy about attending dinner parties. It seems like everyone is constantly rearranging their schedules to accommodate these events, and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. I often find myself juggling multiple commitments just to make it work.
I'm anxious about giving presentations because I feel like the people I'm speaking to are much more knowledgeable and experienced than me. I'm afraid that I'll look foolish if I can't answer a question they ask, and I often imagine myself standing there unable to speak and being laughed at.
It was in that lecture theater and it was a lunchtime lecture, and I really wasn't feeling very well that day, sort of physically not feeling well. I had to give a PowerPoint lecture, but I'm not very good at it. When it was my turn, I was nervous about them noticing my lack of PowerPoint skills. As I talked about my product, I noticed the audience seemed bored, and people were talking in the back, which made me lose my concentration. I couldn't even remember what I was talking about and just quickly wrapped up my presentation. It was awful.
I had a terrible experience recently. I felt so embarrassed, and I'm sure they will never ask me back again.
I often find my mind hunting out things I did wrong and it generates a pattern of worry. It's like my worry is a magnet that eases my mind.
I'm in sales and have to do a lot of presentations and public speaking to groups, often selling them ideas or products.
Last September, I got promoted at work and started working with more prestigious clients, which increased the risk when I see people. I haven't received any specific training for this new role.
I've been doing a good job and my employers said they liked the way I was working, and I had got some good clients on board. They encouraged me to do bigger and better things, but now everything feels different and not the same.
I always get nervous, but it's not as bad as it has become now.
As a patient, I feel that I am often receiving negative feedback from people, and it makes me wonder whether they actually like me or not. I am considering how I would want to treat staff if I were in their position, and I am curious whether my thoughts on this are reasonable or if I should adjust them.
I know that they don't like me because there have been times when six of them met, and four of them didn't invite me to the gathering.
I know that they never phoned me or come and have a cup of coffee with me. Should I write that down?
I feel left out because my friends are going to weight watchers without me, and they never ask about what I'm doing. This makes me think it must be true that they don't care about me.
Ever since I moved to this new place, I've struggled to fit in and be accepted by my peers. As a result, I became dependent on my friend who was much stronger and outspoken than me. However, that dependency lessened around the age of 16. I'm still embarrassed about how much those girls impacted me, but I wonder if it's just a part of the acceptance process.
I've always believed that no one would help me. I've made mistakes in my life and I've paid for them, but now I'm realizing that those mistakes can be considered as useful pieces of learning. However, I still struggle with the belief that no one will help me, even though there have been some people who have helped me before.
It's likely that people will pop up for help, and I'm just as likely as anyone else to be helped.
I find it really difficult to do certain things, and it makes me feel quite uncomfortable.
I'm feeling more aware of my thoughts lately and I've noticed that I've let them run away with me sometimes. Remembering myself as a child has been interesting, and I'm being less harsh on my memories and myself from that time.
I talked to some of my colleagues who have the same line manager as me, and many of them said they always come away feeling like they've done something wrong rather than right. I found it interesting that a lot of people feel they don't get enough positive feedback. It made me realize that it's not just me who feels this way.
I often do things myself whenever someone asks me to do something. I've only found one person who appreciated my work, but I think they may have been sarcastic or just joking. I'm not sure.
I feel like I'm not as clever as the others and it's bothering me. I've noticed that even though some of them are clever, they don't always engage the audience's interest during their presentations. Some of the best speakers I've heard weren't even particularly technical.
I'm worried that I won't be able to interest my audience during a presentation. When I feel really bad in front of a group, it reminds me of when I was little, being the youngest child with an age gap between me and my sister.
I was the youngest in my family, and whenever I tried speaking during family gatherings, I was mostly ignored or dismissed. I often struggled to get my voice heard. My relationship with my parents was not good, but it improved as I grew older.
As a teacher, I've noticed that sometimes when I'm teaching, there are students who are not paying attention and looking out the window. This makes me feel like I'm not an interesting teacher and it bothers me.
I suppose what happened was that I saw some people not looking at me, and that made me afraid to look at anyone else because I thought they might be the same.
I recently gave a presentation, but I was unsure if people were paying attention or not. There was someone who came up to me at the end and said what I talked was useful to their group.
I hadn't really thought of that actually. It's interesting, and I just remembered it now.
I've been feeling a bit down lately, and I need some support to navigate through my emotions.
I actually liked you there in front of me. I think it's a good idea to continue our conversation.
I was in a situation where there was a row at the back, and someone was sitting there. I think about four or five people were involved out of 50.
I'm wearing my presentation suit, which is dark colored and quite smart. However, I must admit that I'm feeling quite rumbling and I'm actually in quite a bit of pain.
I see a room full of people with tears in their eyes, and the lights are undimmed, so I can't see them all. I know that the product I'm talking about is something they don't know, and I can see that some of them are sort of not paying attention.
I feel like a fool because my colleagues seem cleverer than me and they are bored with what I have to say. One of my colleagues, who is a doctor, hadn't done a very good presentation.
I constantly compare myself with my friend and feel like he is more intelligent than I am.
As a patient, we are nearing the end of the session, and I'm okay with closing it. The counsellor suggested that I watch the tape again and think about what I can take from the exercise, particularly regarding how I interact with my mom. They also gave me another piece of homework: asking 10 people about the kind of feedback they get from their bosses.
As a patient, I think it's really helpful to watch the tape, as we've talked about a lot today and it feels like some quite important things were discussed. I can write down the questions I want to ask them too, before watching it, if needed.
I'm surprised how powerful that image was and how it affected the way I was feeling. Also, talking over the appraisal situation has been helpful, as I had forgotten a lot of things. I find it quite hard telling you how I was feeling about the sessions, but I don't think that was not helpful.
When I was younger, people teased me a lot and I felt very apart from everybody. It's not like anybody is teasing me now, but I feel like there's a big pink elephant in the room that no one is really talking about and no one knows how to deal with.
I used to date older guys when I was younger, and I think they were more accepting of my disability. But people judged me for that, saying things like, 'You sounded like you were crazy when you were young.'
I've been feeling unhappy and like something is missing in my life. I thought that once I got into my dream graduate program, I would feel more resolved and settled, but it hasn't been that way. I've been feeling like this on and off my whole life, and despite working hard to hide it, I still feel alone and like everything is a burden.
I feel like no one understands me. It's frustrating trying to explain, and I'm wondering if it's related to my disability.
I feel good about our session and I was expecting something else. I talked about many things I didn't think I would. I'm always late and never really thought it was because of my disability, but maybe I should time things differently. I have cerebral palsy and people often misunderstand its severity when I tell them.
I've had cerebral palsy all my life and have been told that I just walk differently. However, I've always struggled with being organized and have tested positive for ADD. People have told me it might be related to my disability, but I feel like it's just the way I am. I'm afraid that my disability might be affecting other aspects of my life, and it's hard for me to accept.
I must admit that my husband is not strict with our daughter like he should be. I feel like it should be the other way around; he should be more strict with her and maybe less strict with the boys. But he's not helping the situation.
I feel like my husband has a strong bond with our sons, as he is always involved in their activities and never misses their games. However, I think he struggles to deal with our daughter and ends up spoiling her by giving in to her demands. I understand he wants to spoil her, but I'm concerned about this approach.
I think my husband needs to set some boundaries for our daughter, but he's not doing that. I believe that this might hurt her more, and she has been playing us against each other. He can't seem to see it.
I have been really thinking about my daughter's behavior and how it's affecting our family. My husband seems to be at a loss on how to approach her, as he knows how to handle his boys, but seems uncertain with her. She ends up manipulating him and causing conflict between us.
I feel that society has double standards when it comes to boys and girls. Boys can go out, party with their friends, and nobody says anything about them disrespecting the family. But for girls, people talk about us if we go out or stay out all night or date.
I'm really worried about my daughter Nadia. I feel like she's getting more freedom than she should at her age and I'm concerned about who she's talking to on the phone. Even when I ask her, she comes up with excuses and I feel like she's talking to boys.
I took the phone away from my daughter as a punishment, but her father doesn't help the situation. He still gives her his phone, especially when she goes out with her friends. I don't mind her having it when she's out with friends because I need to know where she's at. But if she's being disciplined, he needs to respect that.
I feel like my husband is interfering too much by giving my daughter access to his phone behind my back. He was pretty strict with the boys, but he's doing this with her.
Up until the eighth grade, my daughter was doing well in school, maintaining B's and C's. However, when she started high school, her performance deteriorated. She often comes home upset and claims to have already completed her assignments, only for me to later find out that she hasn't. Despite hiring a tutor, the situation hasn't improved, and she still fails to turn in her work.
I hired my daughter Nadia a tutor and she does her work with the tutor, but when she goes to school, she's not handing in her assignments. Also, I feel like she's selfish and rebellious. She wants everything to be done her way and doesn't follow instructions properly.
I'm feeling frustrated with my daughter because she wants to be out all the time with her friends, stays over at their places, and is always on the phone. When she comes home, she doesn't help with anything even though I don't ask much of her.
I am the patient's mother, and my daughter, Nadia, is in the tenth grade. I was called to school by her counselor because we are both concerned about her failing schoolwork. She is not turning in assignments and sometimes walks in late to class.
I am concerned about my daughter. She makes it to school on time, but recently she told her counselor that she wishes to go to sleep and never wake up again. It really bothered the counselor, so they suggested we see a therapist to work out any issues she may have.
I'm having concerns about my daughter, Nadia. She recently made some serious statements at school which required a higher level of intervention. At home, she sometimes throws stuff, and says she wishes I wasn't her mother or that she was dead. However, I am unsure if this is typical teenage behavior.
I think my daughter might have said something shocking to her counsellor for the shock value. She sometimes says things like that.
You know, I don't want my daughter to have that idea that it's okay for her. She's really young. She's only 15. For her to go and sleep over her friend's house. There is time for fun and there is time for family. There is time for everything. And with her, it's like it's a constant party. I find her to be very irresponsible and sometimes she's been portrayed as reckless behavior.
I have been taking my children to the mosque every Sunday as part of our family tradition, but lately my daughter hasn't been participating in it. She resents going and it leads to arguments between us. My husband sometimes doesn't join us but I still believe in the value of the family activity.
As a tradition, my family and I go to the mosque every Sunday since my children were little. When my daughter Nadia turned 12, she started joining us. One of the customs is to cover our heads with a scarf as a sign of respect when we enter the mosque. I don't wear a scarf regularly, but I make sure to put it on when at the mosque.
As a Muslim, I feel it is expected of me to wear a headscarf when I enter a religious institution.
I'm struggling with my daughter, as she never keeps her room clean or does her laundry. Even though I don't ask her to do anything else like I do with her brother, she still doesn't take responsibility for her chores. Her room is always messy, with clothes on the floor.
I have tried disciplining my daughter by taking away her phone, computer, or grounding her, but nothing has worked. Even her father thinks I am too hard on her, but I disagree. I am having a hard time making these disciplinary measures work, and it is causing difficulties in my life.
I don't think I'm too hard on my daughter, but my husband disagrees. He believes she's young and I should allow her to go out with her friends and have sleepovers. I feel like she has a home, so there's no need for her to sleep at her friend's house.
I'm having an issue with my child wanting to sleep over at someone's house, and I don't feel comfortable with it because of all the dangerous things happening in the world. I believe girls should not be allowed to stay outside their home, but my spouse seems to disagree.
As a patient, I am describing my brother's situation who has older siblings, and they spoiled him and let him get his way.
As a patient, I want to share that I am really proud of my two older sons. My oldest son is in college now and got a scholarship through sports. He is doing wonderfully. My second son is the president of the Honor Society.
As a patient, I feel like I may have used a different approach with my sons compared to my daughter, Nadia. They are wonderful boys and doing great, but I have to admit that my parenting approach is a bit different for them.
I'm a mother who is concerned about my only daughter. She is fragile and I believe she needs protection from her brothers. I always tell them to look after her at school and make sure no one talks to her. I think it is important for her to know that our family's honor is carried by her actions.
I am really upset. I have turned down a lot of opportunities at work because they involved traveling and leaving my family for extended periods of time. I didn't want to do this because my children are my life.
I'm having a hard time at home because my daughter is not making things easy for me. There's a lot of tension, and we argue all the time, me and her father, as well as her and her brothers. It feels constant and unbearable.
It's frustrating for me. I feel like my family is having a hard time, and my daughter's situation is causing a lot of worry. I hope we can get her back on track and bring some stability and peace into our home.
I finally recognized that the child could've died if I hadn't walked into the room when I did, and that there was nothing else I could have done differently in that situation. I've been trying to be strong, but I still question myself.
I have been struggling to stop blaming myself for things that are out of my control, and I need to become more confident in my decisions. I shouldn't second guess or turn back the clock. I have been dealing with these negative thoughts for 40 years, and I'm worried that even if I try to change, they will still be waiting in the wings. What should I do?
I feel like I have a tendency to be weaker and more submissive than my friend who can bully me into not having confidence. I want to improve my strength and confidence, especially with my personal integrity and believing that I am competent.
As a patient, I'd say I give myself a rating of 4.9 or 5 because I think I was doing the best I could under the circumstances. I feel like I need to practice having more confidence in my decisions and care given to patients. I think reflecting on my decisions and care provided at the end of the day would help me feel more confident and help me sleep better.
Lately, I've been trying to feel more confident about my decisions. So, I'm reflecting at the end of the day on the decisions that I make or the care that I've given to a patient, and trying to reconcile the fact that it was good care.
I've been struggling with my relationship with my mom, and it has affected the way I interact with my kids. I vowed not to treat them the way she treated me, but I didn't realize how much it has affected the way I treat myself. I didn't deliberately want to be this way, but I ended up with something like an alter-ego.
Lately, I've been feeling like I have this internal bully that's constantly putting me down. Sometimes, I even wonder if it's my mom's voice in my head. I feel like I have a better awareness of this part of me now, but it's not going away as easily as I'd like.
As a patient, I am having a hard time with being too hard on myself and not giving myself enough credit. I need to work on a compromise to become a happier and healthier person.
I'm trying to act stronger by giving myself credit when I've done things successfully. I need to work on reducing blame, and stop blaming myself for things that are out of my control. When I feel attacked or being blamed, I want to bring that into control so that it doesn't affect me, like the recent incident at work where I followed proper protocol with a post-op surgery patient.
I made the decision to see a patient second instead of first, and it turned out to be the right choice. When I saw that child, I was able to catch a mistake from the previous shift and save their life. If I had not made that choice, the child might have died. I'm not sure if what I did was considered strong or not.
After a good night's sleep, I felt pretty restful and benefitted greatly from the relaxation skills you taught me. However, I don't give myself credit for it, instead, I give the credit to you. I think I've met my goal, but I'm not sure about it.
Yesterday, I went in for my nursing shift. We had a dreadful situation in which a child coded due to the wrong medication bag being hung by the previous nurse. The child had an allergic response and needed to go to ICU. I felt guilty about it, thinking that if I had seen that child first, maybe I would've caught it sooner.
As a nurse, on a regular day, the child I was talking about wouldn't have been the most critical case to see first. So, I checked on another child who had more urgent needs. But I didn't anticipate the situation to change so quickly for the first child.
I'm a nurse and I have been practicing relaxation techniques to help me sleep at night. They were working well until I had a horrible day at the hospital during a shift yesterday.
I was able to implement the relaxation skills that I've learned from therapy. While lying in bed, I would go through all the muscle groups, taking myself through the process, and I managed to drift off to sleep successfully. The tape I used also helped me a lot.
I hadn't slept well in a long time, but practicing relaxation techniques has started to bring me closer to that goal. The skills worked well for me because they were structured, and that's what suits me. I'm also very determined to make it work, maybe because I want to please.
I have been struggling with these negative voices in my head for a long time, and they have become automatic. Recently, there was an incident that left me feeling very self-critical. I am willing to try a new exercise suggested by my counsellor.
I recently had a session with my therapist where I had to play both myself and my self-critical part. As the self-critical part, I told myself that I should've seen another patient first to catch a mistake, and as my regular self, I defended my actions. The therapist remained on the sidelines, coaching and prompting me.
I feel really bad because I didn't foresee this situation, and when I saw the mother's face and her reaction, it was just overwhelming. She asked me what I had done to her child, and I feel like I am being blamed.
I feel accused and criticized by a parent, even though I know I can't foresee everything. They might see me as incompetent for not noticing something that wasn't even my responsibility. This taps into some deeper issues I have been dealing with.
I accidentally hung a bag for a child who was allergic to it, and during the chaos, the mother was taken out of the room. But I felt like she was blaming me for what happened and it's been bothering me a lot.
I'm having trouble shutting off my thoughts, and I keep seeing this face in my mind. I've been feeling self-blame for a while now, even before a particular incident at work. I'm constantly vigilant about pleasing other people, which is probably because of the way I was raised.
I'm frustrated with that person for picking on me. I am constantly put in a position where I need to defend myself, even though I know I shouldn't have to.
I'm feeling frustrated with someone because they keep looking at me as if I'm at fault and doing things wrong when I believe I'm competent. I think I'm doing the best job I can at raising my children, given that it's been my sole responsibility. I've had to support them on my own, and they are not in trouble with the law.
I feel like no matter what I do, it's never good enough for those around me. I've been working hard, taking financial responsibility, and taking care of my children. But still, people always find fault in me and say I'm not perfect or competent.
I feel like if it wasn't for me, others would be too weak to handle things on their own.
I struggle with setting high expectations for myself, which sometimes feel unreachable. I know that I need to make my standards more realistic, but it's hard for me to consider lowering the bar. Ultimately, it's my self-expectations that make me feel like I'm never good enough.
I feel like I could never be good enough for my mother, especially compared to my brother who she thought was perfect. I've struggled with this feeling of not being good enough and seeking acceptance from her for a long time.
I feel sad because I didn't want to put the same level of pressure on my children that my mother put on me. I tried not to be like that with my own children. I think I was successful in my relationship with them, but my mother still had a significant influence since she helped me out when I had to work double shifts, especially when the children were younger.
I think she's stronger than me, so I need to practice and develop my skills to have more confidence. I'm planning on giving myself credit when I've done something I'm pleased with like having a good hospital shift. However, I don't really have experience being pleased with myself and I'm not sure how to do this.
I'm feeling quite down about an episode at the hospital. I'd rate myself a one on a scale of one to five in terms of how pleased I am with myself. Maybe if I had acknowledged to the mother of the patient that I saved the child and it wasn't my fault, I could have felt better and more confident. That would've made me rate myself a four. However, I don't know if I could ever qualify for a five or be that perfect.
I struggle with self-acceptance and constantly rate myself lower than perfect. I want to know how I can learn to be more self-accepting and what could I do differently in a particular situation to give myself a perfect rating.
I chose the patient that was clearly a patient that needed to be checked first more urgently, how could I possibly have been responsible for something the other nurse did? Just because somebody else hangs the wrong bag doesn't mean that it's my fault. I did my job, I was doing what I needed to do.
I feel like I can't stop blaming myself for the situation, and I keep hearing that it was my fault. Even the mother of the child knew it was my fault. I just can't get past these thoughts and find it difficult to accept the reality.
Recently, I was in a situation where I noticed a child having a reaction due to possibly a wrong medication bag being hung. The child's mother was untrained and didn't know who was responsible. I called code and helped save the child's life. However, I'm feeling frustrated because it feels like my coworker is blaming me and not taking ownership for their mistakes.
I was experiencing the happiest time of my life when I saw things through my child's eyes. But I realized that our society can be violent and abrupt, and I was concerned about my child being exposed to such things on television, like the show 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids.' I tried to shield him by not watching a lot of TV. I'm just trying to be present and not care about what others think I should be doing as a parent.
I just don't wanna be by myself. And I think it isolates me because I have a lot of shame around being disorganized and being scattered and always feel, and I'm, you know, when I'm with people, I'm apologizing all the time. "Oh my God, I'm so sorry," "Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I can't find a thing," "Oh, sorry." You know, constantly, I just, oof. I just, I'm sick of the sound of my voice!
I'm struggling with my relationships and it's affecting my life. My mother is in her 80s and lives like a hoarder, but she seems happy. However, I don't have any meaningful relationships in my life, and that's what I want. I want relationships with my partner, friends, and others.
I've been able to create a magical space for my child for about seven years. He's a really amazing kid, and people just naturally gravitate towards him. I believe homeschooling him and letting him hold onto his own soul for a longer period has contributed to him being this wonderful person. I was really tuned into him and we would spend time together, exploring and learning from each other.
I keep losing my things and being forgetful, like the other day I left my purse at a restaurant and had to drive back to get it. It keeps happening to me and it can get really overwhelming. Sometimes I feel really stupid and hate myself because of this. I just want not to have this happening to me all the time.
I've been criticized for being in the moment and not having a lot of judgment. Part of this process for me is admitting that I'm not perfect and that things are happening all the time. It's a relief to be able to talk about it and not feel like I have to hide or that the world will crumble.
I'm the patient in the conversation, and I was discussing the upcoming session with my counsellor Keith Sutton. I asked whether on Wednesday, I would meet just with him or with someone else too.
I've been hiding a lot, trying not to let the world see what a big screw-up I am. People have told me that I'm overweight, don't spend enough time with my dad, and not getting enough male influence. I talked to my mom the other day and shared with her what's going on with me.
Lately, I've been trying to improve my relationships with people and have taken some steps in that direction. I had a conversation recently that went well, and I feel good about it.
I'm feeling a little weird because I was so down three days ago, but now I'm feeling better. However, it's strange because my emotions keep going back and forth. There's just been a lot going on lately and it's really stressful.
I know this is such a hard question you always ask me, I don't know. I can't really get to a straight answer. Sometimes, there are no specific thoughts popping up, it's just vagueness. I remember when my ex and I were together, he'd ask me about my feelings and intentions, and I would be clueless.
I don't have a direct answer to how I feel. I just want to feel well and have a sense of wellness. I faced a problem today as my car was broken into last week, and my kid's library books and the library card were stolen along with it. Usually, I wouldn't deal with such situations and would avoid them, But I handled it responsibly today by going to the library and explaining what happened, and it made me feel good.
I just always feel like, or I've been feeling a lot like, you know, like I'm not doing a good job in supporting my loved one.
I feel guilty about stressing my partner out, and I know he feels guilty too. Sometimes, I say things to him that might make him feel guilty, but it's not intentional. If he wasn't there, I would just be talking to myself, like asking where my keys are. He thinks it's his fault that the keys are missing, but I'm really just thinking out loud and he's there.
I feel really guilty about having ADHD and not being a good enough parent. I feel like good parents have a sense of order and structure, and their kids aren't looking for their keys all the time.
I often feel like something is wrong with me or I'm not good enough, especially when I see how easy things are for others. I tend to spiral into negative thoughts when I'm by myself.
Sometimes, it's hard for me to have compassion for myself. The other day, when I was with Noah, our car got broken into and I was really upset. Later, I told him to go do something because I had an appointment with you. I even asked him if he was going to tell the doctor about what happened. I think my reaction was quite cynical.
I've been trying to help my teenage son, but I feel like I'm not a good mother. He has difficulty opening up to me and connecting with friends. I'm worried about moving too fast and losing his trust.
I have been struggling with getting my child to open up about his feelings with me. He is good with other people, but when I try to engage with him about how he's feeling, he clams up and doesn't want to talk.
As a parent, my child often feels that I don't listen to him, and it stresses him out. I want to communicate better with him but I worry that validating his feelings might come across as agreeing.
I've been trying to remember to practice the breathing exercise we did a couple weeks ago. It's hard to catch myself in that moment, but I guess it's like karate where practice makes it a reflex. I'll try to remember to do it more often.
I want to check back again about talking with Noah in the next session. I'd like to have him turn to me to talk about his stress because it might help him feel better. I'd like to be that kind of support for Noah, but I need guidance on how to practice and be patient with myself.
I'm scatterbrained, disorganized, and I stress my child out because I can't find things easily. I get stressed out and short-tempered but not with him. I also say negative things to myself that he shouldn't hear, like calling myself stupid. I feel like most parents around me are more organized and can find their keys easily.
I used to be so proud of myself and so sure that I was a good mom when my child was little. But now, I often hear a critical voice in my head telling me that I'm not doing enough, and that my child is going to become a statistic. I sometimes feel like depression is like a fog that comes in front of the sun, blocking my ability to see the positive things.
I feel like I'm a really bipolar parent - sometimes I feel like I'm the best parent in the world and other times, I feel like the worst. My confidence level fluctuates from zero to ten, so I guess my average confidence in my parenting would be a five.
I don't know if I'm a good parent or not. Sometimes I feel like I'm doing alright, but there are certain aspects where I think I'm lacking, like getting my child to eat well. My child eats plenty, but I cannot get him to eat healthy food.
I'm having trouble getting my child to eat healthier food. I don't think he eats very healthy because he prefers noodles, cheese, bread or spaghetti sauce, and I feel like I'm not good enough at setting boundaries. Although he doesn't eat junk food like sodas or fast food, he doesn't consume many vegetables either.
I often lose my keys, and when that happens, I panic and search frantically around the house. My son once asked me when was the last time I really lost something, and it made me realize that most of the time, I eventually find the item. I get stressed because I'm usually running late. When I'm in that state, it's hard for me to calm down and think clearly.
I feel like people around me might hear what I'm saying, but they never give me the answers I need. I can't help but conclude that they just don't care about me. I've tried to check this out, but I'm just so tired and weary.
I have tried to talk to my loved ones, and we have had deeper conversations in the past. But I get the feeling that they're not really hearing me or saying what they want to say because they don't want to hurt me. They seem to hold back.
I feel like people are holding back and not telling me the truth because they don't want to hurt me. I have told them that I want to hear what they have to say, even if it hurts. I'm ready for the pain and just want them to be honest with me.
Lately, I've been struggling with some issues, but whenever I try to talk about my experiences with others, they dismiss it as my problem and make me feel like there isn't really an issue to address.
Although this child doesn't look like my son, I still love him. I live overseas and we've had a short time together. I seemed to get it right when I took care of him while his parents were away, and he was very happy.
I felt useful and appreciated and it was easy, which surprised me. I was always quite an anxious mom first time.
I've got a close friend who I really enjoy spending time with, but they live far away. It's sad that we don't get to see each other in person as often as we'd like. We use Skype to communicate, but it doesn't feel like the real thing.
I've been thinking about spending more time with my son by going out with him and showing him my love. But at the same time, I'm feeling really tired and didn't really intend to talk about this.
I feel overwhelmed by the thought that if I matter to someone, they would have expectations from me, and I might not be able to fulfill them. On the other hand, being alone also has its negative connotations of exclusion and not being there. But it saves me from disappointing people or committing to them. I feel like it's an ongoing battle.
I feel like there's a battle going on inside of me, about whether I should be alone or not. It's really exhausting and I don't know what to do.
I've been feeling protected and comfortable with being distant from people, not letting them know that I'm a nice person. But this changed with the arrival of my grandchildren. I didn't know if I truly loved them, even though I know that others can love their grandkids because they remind them of their own children.
I've been feeling like I'm under a spell that I can't break because it needs my children, particularly my son, to express their feelings towards me and tell me what they like about me.
I'm feeling stuck because my family is angry with me, but they won't tell me why. I have lots of fantasies and assumptions about why they might be upset, like maybe they think I don't want Christmas presents or birthday cards from them. I just don't know what's really going on.
I feel resentful because my middle-aged sons don't buy me flowers for my birthday, and it feels childish to ask them if they love me. They would say they do, but I want to know why they don't show it, especially when they buy gifts for their mother-in-law. Why not me? It feels really unfair.
I've been thinking if I actually want to get involved or do anything with them. It feels easier to just step back because it requires less physical and emotional effort.
I've found it easier to not get emotionally involved with people because it means less chance of getting hurt. I feel disappointed when I realize that some people don't love me as much as I'd like them to or when I don't see them as often as I'd like.
I've been thinking about how much I love and want to be a part of my grandkids' lives, and how I want to be the fun, energetic granny that they love. But there's a part of me that's worried I might not become that person, even if I try hard. And if I put in the effort and they don't like me or prefer others, then I'm taking a huge risk by making myself vulnerable to them.
Actually, it just struck me as I've been thinking about coming back to see you today, and just as you said welcome back, we got an hour and I'm aware of it, I'm really nervous about coming back and talking to you. Partly about what I'm going to be saying, and once it's said, it's out there. I suppose what I was thinking about was becoming a grandmother this year and making some choices about my career, and I suppose it's sort of thinking about now what?
I've been feeling really tired lately, and I am questioning if it's normal to feel this exhausted all the time. I become worried because I can't complete the daily tasks I used to, and I wonder why I can't do it anymore. I am also concerned about being a grandmother and having enough energy to do things with my grandchildren.
Lately, I've been thinking about when my children were little, and how much energy I had to do activities with them. Now, I wonder if I'll have the same ability to do these activities with my grandchildren. Part of me is worried because I can't even hold on to two at once, which is surprising.
I've always been noisy since I was a child, and I often feel empty. I try to be a magnanimous woman who doesn't get upset when I don't receive a Mother's Day card, birthday present, or Christmas present from my family. But I still wonder, why don't they do that?
I feel upset because my family doesn't send me Christmas cards or remember important occasions like my birthday. I even tried dropping subtle hints and having my husband remind them. Recently, I sent my son a card for his birthday but didn't send a present because I felt hurt, and now I feel mean and cruel.
I feel really guilty about not giving presents to my grandchildren. I feel guilty that I don't buy something for my grandson and send it on a regular basis. I feel guilty that I haven't put in more effort for them. It's just that sometimes I think it shouldn't matter, but I can't help feeling this way.
I feel really upset because I think I might lose my connection with my own children and grandchildren since they want to spend more time with their other grandparents. This thought is making me feel really down, and I can't help but shed tears.
I feel like I don't deserve my family's love, particularly my grandchildren, and it seems like the ultimate payback for not being the best mom I could be. I've been putting a lot of effort into talking to them every day to remind them that I exist, but it's hard since we don't live close by and my daughter-in-law doesn't involve me much.
I'm struggling with the thought of distancing myself from others in order to avoid the risk of being rejected, which is a fear I have. I've been thinking that if I don't get close to anyone, then I won't get hurt.
I feel strange about your offer to help me without any obligation or expectation on me. I keep questioning why you're doing this and what you expect to gain in return.
I've been feeling like I might disappoint you by the end of the course, and I'm worried that I might not come back for the next session because I've already told you about this.
I can't shut the door in this situation, and if I come back, I'm worried about what might happen next time. I have expressed my needs and this has made me feel vulnerable.
I remember having a special relationship with my grandparents, especially my granddad who made me feel cherished and precious. I'm now wondering how I can create that same bond with my own grandchildren. Do I have to spend lots of money or cook a lot?
I feel unloved by my children and worry that I'll be unloved by my grandchildren as well. They don't treat me like I think they should, but I wonder what can I do to change that? What have I done that made me so unlovable?
As a patient, I feel exhausted trying to balance my own needs with meeting the needs of others, and I sometimes question if my needs are legitimate and if I'm worth it. I'm not sure if this comes from my background or not.
I feel like my childhood stomping didn't work and I don't think it will work now. I can't see anyone who notices me really. I feel like I'm not that important to anyone else in the world, the only one I'm important to is me.
I feel so alone. The only one that I'm important to is me. I feel like I'm putting pressure on others by expressing this, but it's not what I want. I just want my children to say that I matter to them, but I know it's not enough.
I feel like I can't handle anything anymore. No matter what I do, it always seems like it's too much for me to take.
I've noticed that my partner behaves differently with his mother, who is my mother-in-law, compared to how he behaves with me. I have evidence to support this observation, and it's really bothering me.
I feel really exhausted as I constantly have to be the diplomat and the one who smooths things over with my family. I'm worried about losing my grandchildren if I don't put their needs first, but it's taking a toll on my energy and doesn't seem equitable.
You know, I have needs in my family relationships, especially with the children. I know it may sound mercenary, but I need them to show me some appreciation, like sending flowers on Mother's Day. It's not about the present; I want them to think about me and notice me.
I want to feel a part of someone's life, not because I'm a burden on their way but because they genuinely care for me and wouldn't have it any other way. I don't want to have to struggle for that love, but rather have it as a given.
I'm struggling with not being able to have someone close to me, especially when they are far away. I can't have them stay with me and be a part of their lives. This has been really tough for me, and I have tried to compensate by giving material gifts, but that isn't working either.
I feel left out and excluded, like when my best friend has a party and doesn't invite me. It's like everyone is having a good time, and I'm just not a part of it. That feeling of exclusion is really painful for me and brings up old hurts.
I feel like everyone around me is living their life and I'm just watching from the outside, like I'm looking through a window. My son, his wife, and my grandson all seem to be enjoying their lives and I feel left out.
I feel like I'm on the outside and it's a childish emotion, like everyone has to love me. I know they have the right to do what they want, but I still feel left out.
I'm feeling really tired and noticing that even after some time, I still get upset easily. I just want and need to feel loved but I feel like there's no chance for that to happen. I also feel ashamed for admitting this.
I'm feeling a strong need to be loved, and it's difficult for me to cope with this feeling. It doesn't fit with my life philosophy, and I have to work really hard on it. It's like that mental picture from the Wizard of Oz. I just want someone to look at me and say that they love me without me needing to ask them all the time.
I've been feeling as if no one notices me lately, and it's really affecting my self-esteem. I wish people would be more straightforward, show me love, and pursue me. I want them to search for me and make it clear that they care.
I feel pressured and conflicted. I want to be heard, but at the same time, I don't want to bother others with my issues.
I often feel a lot of pressure, and it feels so real to me. It's really hard to deal with it.
I feel like I started building closeness with other people when I realized we had something in common, rather than focusing on our eating disorders. In other places, it felt like connections were based on the eating disorders, and it led to unhealthy behaviors like exercising together or comparing our experiences.
In the past, other programs I've been in didn't believe that I could be fully recovered from my eating disorder. They only focused on being in recovery and struggling, which was kind of depressing for me. How is your approach different?
I came to EDTC because they believed recovery is possible, and that gave me hope. However, at first, I wasn't sure if I could do it. The different levels of recovery at EDTC required me to reach a baseline with food and weight to be healthy, but it didn't dictate exact body size or what my food should look like. It felt more like I get to choose.
I've always known that I wanted to overcome my fears, but sometimes I doubted myself because I couldn't get past them. I was really scared and didn't know how to deal with my fears. When I sought help, I realized that I cared about other people's experiences too, and that was getting me farther away from what I truly wanted.
I wanted relationships, and wanted to be able to go and have fun with a group of friends like going to the movies or having a girl's night. But I couldn't understand why it wasn't happening for me, and I felt like what I was doing was taking me further away from that goal.
Lately, I've been trying to move forward in my life, but I feel like some aspects of my old eating disorder are holding me back. It's like they're puzzle pieces that don't fit anymore, and I keep trying to force them in, but it just doesn't work.
I felt like you guys really cared about not just my health, but also about who I am, what I value, and what I want outside of the eating disorder. Other places made me feel like I had to get my eating disorder fixed before I could build a life, which was scary because I didn't have a life or support system to return to.
I have been working on my eating disorder and starting to build a foundation for my life. I really appreciate the support and guidance from you and the team, which helped me discover what I really wanted in my life.
I am the patient in this situation and I sometimes felt torn between wanting to get better and not being sure if it was even possible. Did you ever experience that?
I tried a different approach and it felt better. It made more sense and didn't feel like a power struggle. When someone tells me I have to do something just because they say so, it doesn't work for me. I feel resistant and wonder why I'm doing it for them. The other alternative is that I do it out of obligation, but only because I'm being told to.
I was trying to make some changes in my life regarding exercise, but they didn't last because I didn't know why I was making those changes except to get to the level I wanted in a program. I struggle with holding on to my values in relationships and can be very black and white or perfectionistic in my approach to life.
I have been struggling with holding on to two different thoughts, such as when I'm facing difficulties in one area and doing well in another. It's challenging for me to accept that both can be true at the same time. For instance, in my recovery journey, I'm dealing with certain issues, but I also know that I have made significant progress and have a lot of positive aspects in my life.
I've been working on some personal issues, and I've found that some of them seem to fall away naturally, like pieces of a puzzle. There were a few that I had to work really hard on, but it wasn't because someone else was telling me I had to get rid of them.
Lately, I've been deciding to get rid of certain habits because I realized they're not working for me. For example, if I choose not to sit in a chair and walk around, it's going to be really hard for me to go to movies with friends. I need to figure out how to adjust to these changes.
I used to struggle with eating, and I had to make a choice between living a normal life or continuing down this path. I remember when I was at UCLA, they made me eat a turkey sandwich without cutting it and I had to eat the whole thing.
For the past six months, I hadn't eaten anything besides a piece of fruit. Whenever I struggled to change, my food was taken away and I was given supplements instead. No one asked me why I wanted to do this or why this step felt important for me.
I still find it weird that my mental health is on a spectrum, not just sick or well. I tend to move along this continuum based on how connected I feel to the life I want, and not because of any judgment. My progress is often measured by various triumphs in different aspects of my life.
Recently, I've been able to push back against my boss, set limits, and use my voice in different aspects of life like fighting perfectionism and overcoming fears. These fears include applying for a job, looking for an apartment, and even eating. All these achievements felt equally important to me. In therapy, we focused more on my aspirations and the person I wanted to be, rather than just discussing my eating disorder and its origins.
I feel like people are missing out on who I truly am because they may write me off as broken or chronic and don't explore other aspects of my life. I am not sure what I would have missed about myself in that case.
I had no idea who I really was, but after going through EDTC, it feels like I'm a completely different person. I've discovered that relationships matter a lot to me, and I'm accountable, tenacious, and loyal. It amazes me how much I've changed and grown in such little time.
Lately, I've been feeling grateful for the experiences I've had in my life, particularly my involvement in the EDTC program. It has helped me discover who I am and has been instrumental in my personal growth. Without it, I feel like I wouldn't have had the chance to learn more about myself and it's really helped me function better in the world.
I'm not fully better yet, and when I struggle more than usual, I sometimes get caught thinking that everything is bad. But I can usually pull myself out of it within an hour. School and life are really stressful right now, and I'm trying to avoid thinking in terms of all good or all bad. I'm taking a heavy course load and might not keep my 4.0 GPA, which is hard for me.
As a student, I've always struggled to accept anything less than perfection. Recently, I discovered an option to elect for pass-fail grading in some of my classes. I decided to give it a try, and now my goal is to get a C or better. I'm trying to be okay with this new gray area.
I used to have a black and white mindset when it came to being sick and recovered. But now, I realize that I still have some growing edges and things I'm proud of that I couldn't have done 10 years ago.
I would say that I am quite good at creating distractions for most people. On a scale of zero to ten, I would rate my need to take control of my eating as an eight or nine. It's really important to me and I want to start doing things to help me gain control.
Today's been a starving day for me. Yesterday, I looked in the mirror and didn't like what I saw, but I still ate because I had to. I kept that down since it was pasta. However, I'm sure in the next couple of days it will get to a point where I'll take four or five laxatives or some ipecac and it'll be gone and I'll feel better. I feel like this eating problem is something I have to fight and it's controlling my life.
I've been struggling with my eating habits, and I'm unsure of how to take control. I want to do something about it, but I need some guidance on how to get started.
I've been trying to keep track of my eating habits to make sure they don't get out of control. I find that I do better with time-based plans, like scheduling specific times of the day for my meals, but sometimes I struggle to stick to those times as well.
I have been trying to make lesson plans for my work, but I'm not doing it as frequently as I should. However, when I do make them, I usually stick to them.
I've been trying to take control of my life by not eating and just getting through the day. I feel like this is working for me and it's a good thing. However, I do drink cherry coke to get me through.
I've been drinking cherry coke for three days and now I'm experiencing headaches. People at work have started to notice my behavior, like not wanting to join them for lunch. They might suspect something about my weight loss, as I have gone from 180 pounds to 130 pounds in a year.
I recently gained control of my life as an art teacher and started recovering from a dissolved relationship. However, I still have some issues to deal with, including low self-esteem that contributed to my eating disorder. I am anorexic and bulimic, and it varies depending on the day.
I tend to not eat for two or three days and then reward myself by eating a lot, after which I throw it up or use laxatives. This has been going on for a while and more people are noticing it. Initially, people saw me as thin and healthy, but I actually felt like I was killing myself.
I guess there's probably so many more things under that category. I mean, there's… I think there are so many more things that maybe I just don’t know about yet. It’s kind of like I feel like…
I was teased a lot when I was younger, and I think it has affected my self-image and relationships. I believe I push people away because of my appearance and the anger and hurt I carry from those experiences.
I feel defective and unlovable. I think I'm unattractive and unapproachable, and I keep people at a distance. My unhappy childhood experiences have led me to develop these beliefs. To fix this, I avoid eating too much, thinking it will make me more lovable.
I find myself trying to fix my problems by not eating, and it feels like I'm going to war with myself. Instead of doing something healthy, like pushing myself at the gym, I choose to not eat for days.
Basically what I'll do is, I won’t eat for like two or three days and then I'll reward myself for doing such a great job of not eating for two or three days and then I'll go and just peg out, you know, I'll throw it up or whatever. So then… I used to be really good at it and you know people would say, oh you look so thin, you look so nice and healthy, and that's just like, I mean, I was killing myself and...
I have been struggling with an eating disorder, which is the most serious and pressing issue in my life right now. It is really hard for me to control it.
I've noticed that whenever I express my emotions, I feel even worse and out of control. This makes me want to avoid and spend time distracting myself from my emotions.
Lately, I have been feeling uneasy about a situation I need to face, and I'm worried about how it will turn out.
I recently gained control of my life after starting my career as an art teacher and recovering from a relationship that dissolved. However, I still struggle with low self-esteem and an eating disorder that I believe started before the relationship but was exacerbated by it. I'm anorexic and bulimic, and it depends on the day.
I'm a teacher, and I create lesson plans for my classes but not as frequently as I should. I find them helpful to map out a sequence for the term, guiding me through the chapters and artists that I need to cover.
I can't look that far ahead. I think the feelings are causing me difficulty, like feeling alone and vulnerable.
I feel out of control when I'm alone and vulnerable. This feeling is bothering me and it's been happening for the last couple of days. I don't understand why it's happening now.
I have a hard time planning my meals because of my work schedule. I usually eat fast foods, have cravings for unhealthy snacks, and don't prepare my meals at home. Can you suggest some ways to help me gain control over my eating habits?
You know, I do much better with like, time, like timeframes, like maybe planning up, take out time of the day to eat and anyway it's sticking to that. Because you know, I could… I can always say right now, well, I can’t… I can't eat right now, because I'm doing this or I'm too busy now, but if I eat at a particular… if I say, I have to eat at four, no matter what or if I have to eat at, you know, whatever time, maybe, you know, something like that when I'm on like some sort of schedule, something like that.
I realized that there is a lot more to all of this. It's like a spiral and I'm going to come face-to-face with the same issues again and again on my path. I'm feeling a little bit better that I looked at this and didn't just go home to avoid it.
I've noticed that other therapists often seem happy when I start to cry, as if losing control is a good thing. But with you, it didn't seem like you cared whether I cried or not. You just wanted information and to know some things about me.
I have been trying to cope with my problems, but the fact is that I don't feel better afterwards. It's frustrating and I don't know what to do.
I think I should get on a program and stick with that for a while and then take the steps to get off. I believe the step-down approach, along with counseling, could help me.
I know I have friends who have gone to counseling, and they've talked to me about it. They've even asked me why I haven't tried it yet. I've been putting it off for a while, but I'm getting tired of feeling this way, so I'm considering giving it a try.
I have some friends who went through the same program as me. Some of them are not doing better and have started using heroin again.
I was just saying that the problem was my friends who used to have issues like mine have managed to stick with the solutions and they're doing a whole lot better now.
I have friends who are also dealing with substance abuse issues. Some of them went to one program and a few went to another program. They seem to have their own approach to overcoming their addiction.
This morning when I woke up, I felt somewhat high. I managed to get some substances before I could fully feel the effects. To get the money for these substances, I do different odd jobs, like plastering and painting.
I have friends who have been able to join a methadone program successfully, but there is a waiting list for it. I have also tried methadone before.
I'm on methadone treatment for my addiction, but I'm concerned about the effects on my body and the potential for addiction to methadone itself. I know the importance of taking care of my body and not abusing methadone like I did with heroin.
Lately, I've been thinking about how it's much easier to quit using methadone than it is to quit heroin on my own. When I try to come off of heroin by myself, it's such a painful experience and I feel like I'm in trouble.
I used to prioritize my marriage over taking drugs, but now that I'm no longer in that marriage, I struggle with heroin use again. My children are the most important thing in my life now.
I don't really tell my family about my substance use because I try to keep it away from them. They might have an idea, but I've never directly talked about it with them. I see my oldest child regularly.
I've been considering making a change in my life, but I'm not sure if it's worth it or not. I need some guidance.
It's not going to be easy, but I would try my best. It's a very messed up situation, you know, but I want to do it for them.
I want to quit a habit that is affecting me negatively, but it seems like a huge step to take. I wonder if there's anything I could start doing right away that could help me with this.
I have lost some friends to drug overdoses, mainly because they were shooting the drugs, not just snorting them.
I've been struggling with drugs for a while and I'm just tired of it now. There's a point where you get tired of the daily struggle and it feels like the drugs are taking more out of me than I'm getting from them.
I've been feeling tired of my friend lately. It's like, sometimes you need to move on from friends when they stick around too long.
I've been struggling with my addiction to heroin and it's been affecting my relationships. I want to say goodbye to heroin, but I don't know how to do it properly. Any advice on how to break up with this toxic friend in my life?
Hi, I'm Danny. I'm here to talk today and get to know you a little bit.
I'm from Chicago and currently 41 years old, turning 42 next week. I'm here today because I'm trying to overcome my drug problem and get my life in order.
Lately, I've been feeling like it's time for me to get my life together because I'm getting older and tired. It all started when I was younger, running with older guys and following in their footsteps. They pulled me under their wing and taught me everything they were doing.
I started using drugs when I was around 14 or 15 years old. I got into a few things, stopped, and then got back into it. I've been doing it again for the past six or seven years. We're talking about cocaine and heroin.
I started doing this activity because I was influenced by my friends, and at that time it seemed like something interesting to try.
I'm straight and I believe my friends who are dealing with some problems can benefit from my experiences as well. Trust me, I'm confident about it.
I encouraged my brother to join a program and I've seen how it's been helping him. However, I backed away from it myself.
I'm Danny, and I feel like I'm finally ready to make a change in my life. I've been tired for a long time, and now I'm ready to take those necessary steps and see what new things could happen.
I've had some setbacks in the past, but I've learned a lot from them. I know that I can accomplish my goals if I really want to, and I'm determined to stick with it this time.
I've been learning from my experiences and trying not to make the same mistakes. For instance, when going around corners too fast, I got scratches. I think I'm improving.
I've got a lot of buddies that do drugs differently than me, but I don't discriminate. We both do it in our own way. However, my friends who shoot up seem to have more problems than me.
I don't always do a lot of it at once when I'm using. I typically take a little bit, sit back, relax, and see how it feels. If I feel alright, I might do a little more, but I always wait a bit before doing more.
I have been taking a little bit of a substance and then waiting to see how it feels before I continue with the next part. I am checking my reactions to it to avoid potential trouble.
I was able to quit my addiction a couple of times by myself, going through the cold turkey method. It was definitely a rough experience.
I've been experiencing withdrawal symptoms for about a week or two. The first three days were the roughest, and then it got a bit smoother, but it still wasn't completely gone. I still have some withdrawal symptoms but they're not as bad.
You know, I just to a sense like stayed away from everybody. And, 'coz see, at the time, I had an ultimatum, right, 'coz ah, there's this friend of mine, there was a choice between her and the drugs, you know what I'm saying and, yeah, my ex-wife. And it was her or the drugs, so, I decided to keep her, you know what I'm saying, the drugs must go, you know. And ah, you could say she helped me get through it, too.
I was doing well for a while, with the support of my partner. However, I started hanging out with certain people and engaging in some harmful activities, which eventually led me to relapse after almost a year of staying clean.
I used to think that bad things wouldn't happen to me, but now I realize they can. I've experienced something really tough that I wouldn't wish on anyone.
I used to feel like my body wouldn't function right without the drug. It's a scary feeling, but reality has set in, and now I need to do what I got to do.
At first, taking the substance helped me feel in the groove, but later on, my body felt like it was just not working without it. So, it wasn't about getting high anymore, but just trying to feel normal and get my body back right.
I have tried to quit a couple of times and went through the rough phases of quitting. I managed to stay off for a while, but then I faced problems and ended up back on it. Sometimes, I got back on it because of hanging out with people and thinking I could control when to stop.
As a patient, I know that there's a way to deal with my problem, which is the good part. My main concern is finding the right ideas and resources to support my decision to change and staying true to myself.
Some days I consume a different amount of substances because I feel like I need more to function properly.
I am experiencing withdrawal from some substance and I have only been snorting it, not injecting it.
All my life, I've been scared of needles. Even when I go to the doctor, I'm scared. Right now, I'm still scared of needles but I can tolerate it if I'm really, really sick and need a shot for a life and death situation. I don't know why, but I've always been scared of needles.
I've decided that I'm going to take steps in the right direction, and I am just trying to psych myself up for this journey.
I've started going the right way, doing the right things, and I feel better now. Everything looks better and is going better, so I want to stay going that way and bring everything in that direction instead of turning around and going back to my old ways.
Lately, I've been struggling with temptation and some negative thoughts but I want to move forward and become a better person.
I have struggled with addiction, but I feel like doors are opening for me now, and my life is getting better.
I feel like I have to have it every day, especially when I wake up, because if I don't, my entire day is just messed up and I can't function properly.
I sometimes get really impatient and feel hurt when I have to sit and wait for hours before being treated. It often makes me want to leave and get relief elsewhere.
I feel like I need something to help me feel okay just to get to the point where I can go through changes, even though eventually I might not need it so much anymore.
I'm worried that when I go to sign up for this program, they might want me to start the same day. I'm not sure if I'm ready for that, it makes me a bit afraid.
I was with this group of people, and we were talking with each other, doing the regular counseling thing. We try to keep in touch with each other and try to keep each other right, to stop each other from backsliding and going back to our old ways.
I feel conflicted because some people I know don't struggle with addiction, and when I run into them, they try to persuade me to join them. I want to take steps towards recovery, but I haven't started yet.
I think the first step for me would be to sign up for the program and then go from there. I would just have to go to the program and talk to them.
I don't know what's keeping me from taking the first step to sign up for the program. When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I feel like I need to do is go out and try to get something to make me feel better.
I felt great and a lot better during the year when I wasn't using the substance. I wish I had stayed off it, but I just couldn't.
When I stopped drinking, I was already married. My wife gave me an ultimatum: leave alcohol alone or she would leave me alone.
As a patient, I mentioned my family and how I had to choose between my wife and children and a different path. I said that my wife was important to me, and at the time, we had two kids, and now we have three.
I have two children who are 24 and 23, and they're doing really well. However, I got divorced from their mother about 12 or 13 years ago.
I was doing well for a year without using drugs, but then I started hanging out with my old friends who were still using. At first, I resisted, but eventually, I got back into the drug problem, which caused a few other issues as well.
As a patient, I am currently discussing methadone with my counsellor to help me stabilize from my drug addiction. My ultimate goal is to eventually get off methadone as well.
I feel like I'm on a bridge and I have to choose between taking the long way or the short way to reach my destination.
I've been considering reducing my drug use by using a safer method to wean off the substances. I believe this approach will help me come down more comfortably and safely.
I have been using methadone as a part of my recovery process, but I believe that receiving counseling at the same time has made a significant difference. I feel that once I completely get off methadone, I already know the right direction to go in, and I'm sincere about sticking to it.
I'm saying, you know, something about staying in the right direction. Oh, yeah.
Well, my father and I, you know, we have a nice relationship, a little bit distant, he, he usually work. But we're close.
As a patient, I feel that it's funny how society views the relationship between mothers and sons. It's like it's not okay for them to have a close relationship. I would want a close relationship with my father, but I wouldn't want my son Neil to feel threatened by that.
I feel a little bothered by my husband's close relationship with his mother. I guess there's some jealousy, but it's not just that. It's also that he has a nice relationship with her and I'm left dealing with all of the problems with her. It feels like I'm doing his job.
I married my husband and it's like I got his family as part of the wedding present. I volunteer to help them, especially his mother, when I see she's upset. I think I'm closer to her than he is because we talk a lot.
I have a close relationship with my mother, and we spend afternoons just talking and taking walks. However, I feel conflicted because I think it's okay for mothers and daughters to be close, but when it comes to mothers and sons, I believe they shouldn't be as close.
I'm tired of going to our families all the time and my partner gets tired of the same routine as well. I understand that everyone gets tired of the same old stuff sometimes, like I get tired of going to work every day and just want a day off or someone to drive me to work.
I usually don't do many romantic gestures for my partner, but I know she loves sweets, so the other day while she was at work, I brought her a little cake as a surprise. She didn't find it romantic though and would have preferred a bouquet of flowers.
As a patient, I feel frustrated when others say the positive changes my partner is making are for me. I believe my partner should do things for herself first, and then for me. I don't want her to just do things to please me, she should also focus on her own goals, like going to school and getting a good job.
I want my partner to focus on the important things in life and to be more emotional with me. I wish I could get him to ask himself what God would want from us and treat each other like angels, instead of worrying about what other people think.
I'm feeling frustrated because my partner depends on me a lot, and I wish she would take more responsibility for herself. For example, when we go grocery shopping together, I always end up carrying everything. If I'm at work and she goes shopping, she'll wait for me to get off work to help carry the groceries up the stairs.
I feel like I am trying to be more responsible and not depend on my partner too much, but I don't see him trying. There are many things that I do for him, like tidying up after him when he leaves a mess.
I feel like my partner is constantly tidying up, but not necessarily for me. I don't want to see it as her doing it just for me, because it's a part of life that everyone should do. I wouldn't pick up things as soon as they're used, and I feel like she's doing more than necessary.
When my partner and I were courting, we didn't really exchange gifts. Instead, we spent time together, like going to the park and laughing and joking around. That's why I fell in love with him.
I've been hanging out with my partner, playing games and spending time together. But she doesn't think I'm romantic at all. She didn't fall in love with me because of my eyes. I'm not sure what made her fall for me in the beginning.
I liked this person because we had things in common and he was a nice guy. He was dependable and would treat me well. We used to go around visiting friends, and that was fine because I didn't know any of his friends.
I was raised in a nice home with great parents, but they taught me to always take care of myself. If I wanted something, I had to go out and get it without waiting for somebody else's help. It's the bottom line – do what you have to do to make it in life. I was taught to take action and be responsible for my survival.
I was in the Army for 4 years, and I was always told not to sit around and wait. So, if I want something done, I'll discuss it with my partner. However, if it's not done, that's when attitudes come into play and we get mad at each other. I'm not trying to make her do stuff nor is she trying to make me do things.
I was raised by a minister, so my worries and goals in life are more spiritual, loving, and emotional. My partner was raised differently, with a focus on material things and taking care of oneself. We're supposed to learn from each other, but we don't know how to go about that.
I was in the Army for 4 years, and I was always told not to sit around and wait, because if you do, you'll lose out. So when I feel that something needs to be done, I discuss it with my partner, but if it's not done, attitudes come into play, and we get mad at each other. I don't try to make her do stuff, and she doesn't try to make me do things either.
I was really raised as the baby of the family, so I had everything thrown at me. Now I have a lot of responsibility to learn, and I know I need to be more responsible since I'm a mother now. But I'm not a go-getter and that's not a strong part of me.
Lately, I've been having a lot of thoughts about mythological creatures. For instance, there's this one called Pegasus that I just can't get out of my head. It's a creature with a horse's body and a man's upper body. Do you know what I'm talking about?
I feel like I'm a unicorn Pegasus, but all I do is stand there and can't fly. I just stomp and look silly.
I was just sitting there when this fly started bothering me, and I began stomping to get it away. My partner saw this and was watching me, which added to my frustration.
I feel like there is a unicorn and a fly in a situation, and the character is just standing there not doing anything about the fly. I just want to get away from the fly and go into the pasture.
I have this odd fantasy about a cat and a bird, but I know they don't get along in reality. I see myself as the cat in this scenario, but I'm not sure if I should change the bird's image.
I feel like I have the advantage over someone because I can creep up on them like a cat and they can't spot me everywhere I go. My worst nightmare is if someone closed the barn doors and we were trapped together.
I am worried about my fear. I fantasize about this half man, half horse, Pegasus creature that constantly disarrays the whole barn and messes it up. It stays like that until someone releases it again. I fear that this situation might go on forever.
I have never been in counseling before, and this is a first experience for me. I am still kind of shaky and nervous about explaining my problems to everyone. I am not one for doing all of that, and if I feel I can't solve it myself then maybe there's not a solution. However, I decided to come because I know if there's something wrong and you need help, you should go get it.
I feel like my partner listens to what I say, but he doesn't take any action on it. We're two different people with our own ways, and we need a mutual understanding. That's why I wanted to come to counseling.
My partner and I are having difficulty meeting in the middle when it comes to our expectations of each other. We seem to keep crossing each other's paths instead of coming together. We communicate a lot, share our problems, and try to work things out, but somehow we can't seem to find a common ground. I don't know why this keeps happening.
We both knew that we were capable, it's just putting all the pieces together to make the complete puzzles so that it can be complete. Just be more caring.
I've recently realized that I want to make a change, specifically to become a more caring person. I feel like I'm capable of this because I've done things like skydiving, which shows that I can take on challenges and conquer my fears. But I'm a little unsure about where to start and how to take it step by step.
I am unsure about my new counsellor and nervous about discussing and sharing my experiences which were recorded from previous therapy sessions.
I am the patient in this situation, and I feel like the main issue between my partner and me is not our cultural differences, but the different ways we think and our ideas about how we should get together. I believe that I'm not responsible enough and my partner is not emotional enough.
I feel that my partner's idea of being romantic is different from mine. She wants me to bring her flowers, cards, and go out for candlelight dinners, but I think that providing everything she needs and not having to worry about anything is romantic enough.
I have been living with my partner for about 2 years. In the beginning, I was the only one working and bringing in money, while she provided emotional support. Now we both have jobs, but I still feel like the responsibility and burden of our life was mainly on me during that time.
I had a baby and got pregnant a year after we were together. I worked for the first 3 months of my pregnancy but then stayed home, and he took care of me. About six months after the baby was born, I went back to work. My partner took care of the baby after I started working.
Recently, my partner and I have been able to manage work and taking care of our baby by switching between jobs and staying at home. Although we are financially stable now, we still have a lot of arguments. I'm not sure if that's the way we communicate or something else.
I'm doing my thing, and she's doing hers. I'm still doing what I need to do, like if something needs to be done I'll go ahead and do it, and that's it. If she needs something to be done she'll kinda wait, and wait, and see if I'm gonna go ahead and either do it, or push her to do it or something of that nature, and that's part of the problem cuz' it's burning me out. It's burning me out, you know, I'm trying, and trying on my side and then I'm also trying, and trying to help her as well and, uh, I don't know.
I started interracial dating at a young age, around 13 or 14. My family initially thought it was just a phase, but eventually realized it wasn't and began to accept my relationships. My current boyfriend has been well-received by both of our families, and we haven't had any major issues.
I have been with my partner, Kayla, for almost 3 years now, and we live together. Our families have no issues with each other, which is a great relief. But I feel relationships can be complicated when families are involved.
I've been struggling with a problem that causes a lot of tension and frustration. My partner and I keep knocking heads and can't seem to get it together. In a dream, my partner appeared as a pretty little bird flying around.
I had a dream where I saw a pretty little bird, but I can't remember its color. In the dream, I was a cat.
I was raised as the youngest child in my family, so I always had everything done for me. I never had to worry about responsibility growing up. I was also raised in a minister's family, with strong spiritual values.
I've never had a problem with interracial dating and started dating interracially at a young age, around 13 or 14. My first relationship was a bit iffy, but it didn't cause any major issues.
During the holidays, my family would celebrate and cook together or we'd go out. I would attend these gatherings but only because I didn't have a choice. I would go, eat, enjoy myself briefly, and then go to sleep or mind my own business.
I feel frustrated because my partner doesn't seem to show the same level of thoughtfulness as me when it comes to exchanging gifts with family. He often shows up empty-handed while others bring thoughtful presents. He also doesn't see the importance of making romantic gestures, like bringing flowers or going out for a candlelight dinner.
I've been having trouble understanding my partner's idea of romance. To me, it's not just about having everything I need, but also feeling special. My partner thinks that because he gets me something every day, there's no need to make extra effort on special occasions like my birthday or holidays.
I don't know why my partner goes through mood swings. When they are happy and not complaining all the time, it puts me in a good mood. However, they often complain about small things like wanting to go somewhere or do something, which can be annoying. I just want them to stop complaining.
Lately, I've noticed that my partner seems to have a happier disposition, especially since our baby was born. She used to mope around the house a lot, but now she walks around happily. Our 10-month-old baby also lifts both of our spirits when either of us is in a down mood.
I bought a cake for my partner because I know she likes sweets. I didn't really see her reaction, as I work midnights and had to go to sleep after we got home. She told me, oh you bought me a cake, thank you, and that was it. I'm not sure if she really appreciated it.
I really appreciated that my friend liked the cake I made for her. It made me feel good and I didn't feel bad afterwards. I believe I can produce that kind of reaction in her again.
I have been trying hard to keep the house clean, make dinner, and fulfill other responsibilities, but my partner doesn't seem to try to fulfill my needs. He's not romantic at all and doesn't appreciate me on special occasions like my birthday or holidays. I feel jealous because everyone else I know is celebrating and spending time with their family on these occasions.
I've been told by others, including my girlfriend who left me, that I have issues and they feel threatened by me. My sister suggested I come here for help. I'm not sure what's wrong with me, but when so many people suggest getting help, I feel like I must be doing something wrong.
I have been struggling with finding meaning in my life after my third relationship ended in a similar way to the previous two. My girlfriends left me without explaining much, and I'm left wondering why things went wrong. It scares me that I might be doing something to people without realizing it.
I have been living with my partner for four years, and she is 35 years old.
I'm having difficulty understanding people's reactions to me, especially when they feel threatened by me, even though I never intend to threaten anyone. Lately, I've experienced many failures in my relationships and I'm starting to question the meaning of my life. Sometimes, it's hard for me to find a reason to stay alive.
I've had bad experiences with therapists in the past, which has made it difficult for me to trust anyone. My last girlfriend and I went to therapy together, and the therapists talked her out of the relationship. Now I'm left questioning my ability to be in a relationship and I find it hard to live alone. I've been living with my sister for some time, but now I'm living alone again and seeking treatment to give myself another chance.
I was really surprised when I found out my partner was pregnant, because she didn't even realize it herself. It was only after I noticed some changes in her appearance, like her skin and eyes, that she started thinking about her missed menstrual period and realized she might be pregnant.
I recently found out my partner is pregnant. She told me that I didn't give her enough space and that I was always trying to help her with her insecurities by filling in her thoughts and feelings too quickly, which made her feel like she couldn't be herself.
I felt angry when my partner called my love for her controlling because it was never my intention. I might have worshipped her a bit too much, but I don't know if that's the issue. She has told me that my behavior was controlling in the past, during our therapy sessions.
I am a 35-year-old man, and I'm still in love with my ex-girlfriend. Our relationship was satisfactory for me, but not for her. We were together after receiving therapy, but I'm not sure what to do now.
My partner left me suddenly one day, leaving a note. We had previously gone to the emergency center because she was pregnant and needed help. After we went there, she was taken away by the therapists, and I couldn't find her. They made the decision because they thought she felt threatened and afraid of me, but I don't want to harm her.
My partner wanted me to go with her to a counseling center because she felt very insecure about everything, especially having a baby. She was considering getting an abortion, and I was opposed to it. She also felt that there wouldn't be enough room in our relationship for a child because I wasn't giving her enough space. I thought we had a very close relationship, and I was the one who actually asked her if she was pregnant when I noticed some changes in her.
My partner was unhappy with me when she got anxious about having a baby. She thought there wouldn't be enough room for the baby in our life because we were so close to each other. I believe this concern came from her insecurities.
I thought my partner had some doubts and difficulties, so I suggested we go to counseling since it had helped her in the past. During our session, she said a lot of critical things about me, even though she had never expressed any unhappiness about me before.
I was in a therapy session with my girlfriend and her therapist. I felt like the therapist was putting words in her mouth and creating problems between us. They accused me of telling her what she was thinking without her thinking it, but I didn't believe that was true. I felt like the therapists were setting her up against me and convincing her to leave me.
I went to the emergency center with my partner as she insisted because she was worried about things going wrong with our baby and our relationship. She had never mentioned any concerns or criticisms before, but during the session, she told me that I tend to assume what she's thinking without her actually thinking it.
I can do it, we can do it. In a way, my partner panicked and felt unsure about having a baby within our relationship, so I suggested we seek help. Later on, I found out through therapists and a note that she felt threatened and scared of me, which was devastating and confusing because she never expressed any complaints or concerns to me directly.
I grew up in a Jewish culture and my parents would prefer me marrying someone Jewish. However, this isn't a problem for me as I am prepared to marry my non-Jewish partner. Our relationship is great.
I have a problem because I feel like my family won't approve of my relationship. We're all really close, and I talk to them a lot. I visit home five or six times a year. I worry that they'll never be at ease with my partner and won't fully accept them into the family.
I am really concerned about how my parents and siblings are reacting to my fiancée. I care about their opinions and sometimes feel guilty because of their reactions, but I love my family.
I feel like my relationships have a great deal of importance in my life.
I'm getting married in June and have a great relationship with my fiancée. However, ever since I asked her to marry me, I've been having problems with my family and some of my friends in my hometown and at my graduate school. My parents do love and support me, though.
I feel tension and guilt when I visit my parents with my fiancée because I know they don't fully approve of our marriage. They like her as a person, but they don't want me to marry her. I think the main issue is that I'm Jewish and she's Methodist.
I'm facing a dilemma with my partner regarding our religious beliefs. We both have our own faith and enjoy our religion, but it's not a huge part of our lives. My partner goes to church maybe once a month, and it's important to her, but not a central aspect of her life. It's pretty much the same for me.
I'm struggling with the religious differences between my partner and me. It seems to cause conflicts and I'm unsure if I should be doing something about it or just accept that I'm going against my religious tradition. I'm also worried if this will still be an issue ten years from now, as I'm already tired of dealing with it for the past six months.
I feel like my family doesn't listen to me. They impose their religious beliefs on me, and I feel guilty when I don't follow their expectations. But, Judaism is a big part of our family, and we grew up with it being important in our lives.
I'm feeling concerned about my relationship with my parents, as they seem to pressure me into having a more traditional relationship. It's nothing overt, but my dad withdraws and my mom makes subtle remarks about others having traditional marriages. It's important to me because they are a significant part of my life.
I have been feeling very stressed lately because of my family's interference in my relationships. They seem to be trying to control who I date, and my mom even brought up an ex-girlfriend in front of my current partner. I haven't seen this ex in 10 years and it's irrelevant to my current relationship. I don't understand why she is doing this.
My parents usually like my fiancée and people in general really like her too. She's very nice and it's hard to find a reason to dislike her. However, they don't seem to accept her due to our difference in religion.
I mean, I still want to work on this and I would like some help, so I'm willing to do that.
I've been struggling with the fact that although the holidays and Jewish culture are very important to me, I won't be raising my children Jewish. It feels like I'm forgetting about all that and maybe my partner doesn't understand the significance of it.
I feel like my parents are worried about my lack of religious adherence and the possibility of my children not following their faith. My mom, in particular, is grieving the loss of her religious mother and might see my choices as the end of the family's religious tradition.
I don't know, I mean, you know, maybe this isn't the kind of thing, or maybe I just need to work this out, you know, myself and, I just need to sit and really talk with them and, you know, hash it out.
I feel like whenever I use a public restroom, I'll get sick, and ultimately, that will lead to me dying. My fear is based on this thought, even though I know it's not entirely rational.
I feel anxious about the idea of being contaminated, and I worry that it could make me sick or even kill me. These thoughts have crossed my mind probably thousands, if not millions, of times.
I've been worrying about getting sick too often, but when I think about it, I haven't actually been sick a thousand times as I feared. In the last three or four years, I've only been sick a few times.
I struggle with using public restrooms due to my fear of germs and getting sick. The idea of getting really sick and facing the consequences scares me and I don't like to think about it.
I have this fear of dying and even though I know it's unrealistic, I can't help it. The fear takes control over me and it's hard to convince myself that I won't die when I'm scared.
I'm feeling very uncomfortable and contaminated after placing my hands on the sink without washing or rubbing them. My anxiety level is around a six or seven, and I have strong urges to clean my hands.
I'm trying to stay strong, but I feel like I have germs crawling all over me. I know my fear exaggerates it, but that's what I'm feeling right now.
I was feeling anxious at a level five, but now after talking about my fear, it has come down to a level three. However, I'm still worried about getting sick.
I'm feeling a little better, about a two.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and found myself catastrophizing certain situations. I've managed this before by reminding myself that it's not a relapse and that I can bounce back. I practice rewinding the tape in my mind and then planning how I want to do things differently next time.
I still have those little blue dots around to remind me of my plan. I use the self-statements like 'Be strong, be positive, be realistic' to help me stay strong during exposures and whenever I need a boost. It makes me feel good about myself.
I have been thinking about the upcoming holidays where I will stay with my husband's family for a few days. Being away from home, dealing with different people, and using their restrooms makes me anxious since I haven't done that in a while. I am worried about how to handle potential challenges related to my OCD during this time.
I find myself starting to wash excessively and mindlessly, especially under stress. I've done it a few times and then realized I had a setback. I want to get back on track.
I know my husband feels fine without me taking care of things at home, but I'm afraid to give up what I've got. It's really scary to think about the risk and uncertainty of leaving behind the life I've established. What if I don't like it when I get there?
I'm feeling a lack of confidence in succeeding in this new direction. I think it's more the fear of giving up the security I had with my degree.
Since I've gained my new status, my home life has been affected. I don't have as much time as I used to, but I never really spent a lot of time on household chores anyway. I don't think my husband has noticed much difference.
I've been struggling with balancing work and school, which has been a dream of mine for a long time. I got accepted into the program and had everything planned out, but something's not quite right. I can't make the shift from work to where I want to go.
I feel conflicted because my job has always been important to me, and I've spent a lot of time and effort establishing my professional identity. I am comfortable in my current career, but now I'm facing a new situation where I don't know what I'm doing and I'm scared that maybe I can't handle it or it won't be what I really wanted after all.
I have been thinking a lot about my career and school, and I feel very supported by my husband, who encourages me to follow my dreams. We don't have children, so that's not an issue. He believes it's better for me to pursue my goals now, rather than waiting till I am older and regretting not taking action.
I love my current job because it's exciting and challenging, but I find that I can't let go of it, even though I want to. I'm not sure what's keeping me here, maybe it's the security or an underlying fear that I won't like other options.
I am struggling with a conflict between going back to school in the same field and staying in my current career versus making a total career change. It feels like I am stepping into an entirely new realm, and that's causing me anxiety.
I have been feeling conflicted between my work and school lately. Although my job is flexible and I've managed to work out time requirements for school, I'm still unsure of the exact cause of this conflict. I'm able to get everything done that needs to be done at both work and school.
I have been juggling work and school for three or four years, but I am having difficulties. I initially planned to quit my job this fall and devote all my time to school, but now, I'm unsure if I will be able to handle it financially.
I've been feeling really overwhelmed with everything going on in my life, but talking to you has made it a little less overwhelming. I appreciate your help.
I am Kate, and I've been discussing various issues with my counsellor. Recently, we decided to focus on the losses I've experienced, especially the loss of my mother about a year ago.
I've been experiencing a lot of loss lately. First, I lost my partner in September, and then my father moved into a home in January. I had to move out there to be with him for a while, and eventually, I had to deal with selling his house as he moved to a care facility.
I've been very tired lately. I think I coped with my mother's passing initially fine because she was 88 and wanted to go. I was kind of happy for her that she went as easily as she did, so it almost didn't seem like there was any reason to mourn. Her death happened very quickly in the end.
I have been living on my own, and sometimes it doesn't feel so easy. I just have to get on and do what I have to do since living alone.
I've been living alone for about 12 years now, and sometimes it gets really tough. I feel flattened by the loneliness and the need for someone to care for me.
I have been experiencing a loss of energy lately, making it difficult for me to even do activities I love, like walking in nature. I have tried going for walks, but my energy levels are just not the same. I also find myself wanting to curl up and just disappear under the covers, but I have been trying to shake myself out of this constant tiredness.
I almost need permission to curl up in a ball. Sometimes, I get it from women friends who ask me difficult questions, like what do I do to take care of myself or what would I normally do if I were feeling like this.
I recently lost someone important to me and it has brought up feelings of anger and sadness. Along with the grief, I realized there's also anger because he abandoned me a long time ago. I find it difficult to express my anger and this situation has drained my physical energy, making it hard for me to do what I normally do.
I have been following a life pattern similar to my father, which might be called stoicism, where we just deal with problems and move on. But lately, I've realized that I've experienced a lot of loss in a short amount of time and that it's a lot for anyone to handle. I think I need some compassion for myself.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and rushed. I'm starting to feel a sense of peace when I try to embrace this other part of me that doesn't always need to be in a hurry, but I'm worried that my feelings of sadness and anxiety won't disappear quickly.
I feel very uncomfortable and in pain due to something that happened in my past, which I believe was influenced by my parents. This current conversation is also making me uncomfortable.
I am not sure what you mean by 'digesting it.' Could you explain it?
I've noticed that during my self-development journey, something will come up in a session and I might forget about it for a while, but then it might resonate later on and I realize that it has actually impacted me, even without consciously thinking about it. This process is hard to explain because it is so woven into the fabric of my life.
I've been reflecting on the complexity and mystery of life, and how there's so much that goes on that we're not entirely conscious of. I also struggle with shutting away from difficult feelings due to lack of support or training and education.
Over the past couple of years, I have become much more willing to digest and explore difficult feelings. I've been thinking about whether I am tasting, sensing, and chewing on these emotions, and I've realized that there is value in this exploration. Ignoring these feelings just doesn't work.
I've been using a coping mechanism that seems to work, but only in the short term. I'm not sure if it's effective in helping me reach my ultimate goal.
I have been upset since my mother's passing, even though we had a strained relationship and I lived far away from her. Additionally, I had to end an 11-year-long relationship with a man I loved, and it has been incredibly hard for me. These losses seem to be getting tangled up together and I'm not sure how to deal with it.
For many years, I thought I had the wrong mother. She wasn't someone I could ever talk to. I adored my father, but he was a very remote figure, always working hard and caring for us...
I am finding it difficult to balance my life, and although I have become more conscious of it, I still struggle at times. I also watched a video that made me feel a sense of sadness and grief again about a special person I lost, and it's still there in a different way.
I've come to terms more with my mother's death, which happened three years ago. I feel like I have a whole new relationship with her now, even though she's in spirit. I feel like she's supporting me in a way she never did when she was alive. I saw a medium twice, and my mother communicated through them, apologizing for some things and saying she can now see me better.
I've created a very special and beautiful place as my home, with a river flowing through it. It's important for me to be in the flow and feel energetically connected to my surroundings. Since we last met, I've qualified as a shamanic healer.
I have energy now, and I'm much more physical than I was before. The place I moved from was small and contained, but now I'm even proposing to go on a one-day course to learn how to use a circular saw for my wood burner. It feels exciting and transformative, as I've managed to really root in a place and create a home. However, when it comes to being gentle with myself, I'm not sure if there's much improvement, but I do hold that awareness and think I am better.
I've experienced several recent losses that have been difficult for me to cope with. I lost my mom just over a year ago, my partner in September, and had to move my father into a home in January.
I've been very tired lately. I had to deal with the death of my mother, who was 88. I think I coped with her passing initially fine because she wanted to go, and I'm happy she went as easily as she did. However, dealing with everything else like selling the house and experiencing so much loss in a short time has been really difficult and overwhelming.
I recently lost my mother unexpectedly. She was in the hospital for only 12 hours due to an infection that spread rapidly. I was driving back from another part of the country to spend time with her, but she passed away before I could make it.
I have been trying to cope with my difficult feelings by locking them away, but I recently took a homeopathic remedy which has helped me.
I am a very independent person, but the session with you showed me that it would actually be very helpful if I asked for some help. So I did see a counsellor for a while, not necessarily about the same issues, but they were still useful.
I felt like I had an infection locked in my chest, but it turned out to be grief. I took a homeopathic remedy, and it helped me to allow the grief to flow. I also do Shamanic work and have regular massages.
I watched a session recently and realized that I actually worked more on my home than I initially thought. I feel like I'm making progress.
I have been trying so hard to be perfect and be on time, but I've realized that when I express my pain and grief, it actually allows others to relate and express their pain and grief. It even makes it easier for people to connect with me as a human being.
I've realized that grief doesn't have to mean feeling closed off and in a dark place. We talked about changing the meaning of words, like digestion, which now means something different for me. Grief has also come to mean something different for me.
Lately, I've noticed that the meanings of some key words in my consciousness and self-development have changed for me in a substantial and deep way. My perspective on them has changed, and I'm wondering, do people really change? It's a bit of a philosophical question.
I didn't want to be there initially, but I've managed to get through it to some extent. The man who had been very precious to me is still a source of pain, and that loss is diminished but not gone. I've realized that the depth of love is proportional to the depth of grief.
Lately, I have been feeling really sad and confused. It's been incredibly painful for me, and I have been experiencing these intense feelings for more than just a week.
I recently looked back at a video of myself after losing a loved one and was in tears again, realizing that the pain hasn't completely gone away. Part of the grief was the loss of my childhood home, but now I've moved to a place that feels like home. I've just turned 60 and found the perfect place, with a beautiful view and land around it, and it feels like I have finally grown up and taken responsibility for my life.
I have had so many emotional events in a short period of time, which has flattened my physical energy. It's been hard to do what I normally do easily. I'm following a life pattern like my father, maybe it's stoicism or something.
I've been struggling with the fact that I live alone and feel like I need to have more compassion for myself. I've always had to deal with this feeling ever since I started living on my own.
I have been living alone for about 12 years after splitting up with my partner. It is difficult and tough to be on my own because there isn't someone to be caring and be a friend.
Lately, I've been feeling like I've been flattened by my struggles. It's as if everything is just weighing me down and I can't seem to find a way out.
My father is 90 years old now and he's not the same man he used to be. I feel like the person I knew and adored as my father is gone, and it's making me feel rather sad and disconnected.
I feel like my partner has abandoned me, and it somewhat makes me feel vengeful but that feeling doesn't last long. On top of that, I experience a mix of emotions like grief, anger, and fear.
I got trained by mom and dad to be tough, and I used to play netball at school. Once, I fell badly and had a severe gash on my knee, but I got up and continued playing until I saw blood running down my leg. I think I'm at the point now where I need to recognize that I'm hurt and it's okay to stop.
I feel overwhelmed by my situation, but I appreciate having someone else here with me to share and discuss it with. It makes it a bit less overwhelming.
It's been nearly two years since I had a session with you regarding my experience of loss.
I remember when we had our first session, and it was such a great experience for me. I felt truly seen by you, and I was able to see myself and let my mother's spirit see me truthfully as well. She always thought I was special, and I believe she knows that now.
I recently found a beautiful place with the perfect weather that my mother would have loved. It feels like a special place for a special person, and I felt a connection when I was there.
I experienced a lot of emotional pain after losing someone close to me. It was bleak and not only did I suffer emotionally but I also felt a physical pain. My body was in pain and my heart was in pain as well.
I've reached a point where I can say that I'm special without it coming from a place of ego. I realize that everyone is special in their own way, and it's important for us to find our place and give expression to our unique gifts. But, I've heard criticisms that counselling is too focused on the self and can be self-indulgent. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on that.
I'm starting to feel like I am benefiting people in my life, and I feel more worth loving. However, there's a difference between feeling special and wanting to be the most special person in the world. I think this might be related to not being valued or loved in my childhood.
I feel like I should change the meaning of certain words and connections because it has been deeply ingrained in me. I want to be more loving and compassionate with myself, and be accepting of my feelings and how things work. However, this feels different from my family of origin.
I think if I had an inside mother, I'd feel held, embraced, loved, and not trying to change my feelings. I'm beginning to have a sense of embracing this other part of me that feels flattened and very tired.
As a patient, I'm having a hard time digesting these huge experiences I've been through. I understand it's going to take time, compassion, and kindness, but the process is very uncomfortable and painful for me.
I was married for 18 years, but it was a very lonely time for me because my spouse was always focused on his job. He was physically present but emotionally absent. I feel like I've experienced these distant relationships multiple times in my life.
I used to think of it as changing the meaning of words or connection of the word, like the word 'home', for example. Now, I guess it needs to change. I'm trying to be more loving and compassionate with myself, accepting my feelings, and it's definitely different from my family of origin.
I feel like if I had an inside mother, I would feel more held, embraced, loved, and understood. My emotions would be acknowledged without an attempt to change them.
The death of my mother was unexpected, and I felt her leave her body while I was driving to see her. We didn't have an easy relationship, but I miss her now. Shortly after her death, I ended an 11-year relationship, which has been extremely painful for me. I've been mourning both losses, and it's been challenging.
I've been feeling a loss of energy lately, and it's been difficult for me to do things I usually enjoy, like walking in nature. I just want to curl up in a ball under the covers and escape from the world, but I feel like I need permission to do so.
I've been feeling homeless lately, because in the past, when I faced problems, I would go back to my parents' house. But now, there isn't a home to go to. Even though I had a distant relationship with my parents, their home was still my refuge in difficult times.
I felt somewhat relieved because even though the people I was with weren't ones I could really talk to, at least there was somewhere I could go.
I am a counsellor, and my patient Kate just told me about how she was homeless at 18 and struggled with not having a stable and comfortable home. She said that her father and mother's home was her alternate home when things were tough, but she couldn't really talk to them about her problems.
I have been married for 18 years but it was a very lonely time as my spouse was married to his job. He would bring his body home but not himself, and it was similar to the distant relationship I had with my parents. I've gone through this pattern in my relationships three times now.
I have been feeling emotional as I talk about my parents' journey to this country for a better life. My mom was homesick when she first arrived here, and letters from home made her happy. My dad, on the other hand, came here to help support his family back home. He later met my mom and they got married. Both my parents came from large families, but suffered losses as well. It's hard for me to talk about this because my dad passed away four years ago.
As I reflect on my family's immigration story, I remember how my parents had to go through difficult times to make a life here. They were willing to share their home with others and help them settle down. I've seen many people come and go, witnessing their struggles as immigrants.
I am having a hard time with the struggle of my identity, feeling ashamed about how Mexican or how American I am. However, I am also actively involved in supporting my parents' immigrant story and the activism that happened at that time, which makes me feel proud.
I'm driven to participate in advocacy and marches, especially around immigration, because my family has been impacted significantly by amnesty laws. Some of my relatives are undocumented, and I want to be the voice for those who don't have one or are afraid to use it. So I try to bring awareness within my family and do whatever I can to make a change.
I am sharing my family background. My mom is one of six siblings and had to become like a second mom to her younger siblings after my grandfather passed away when she was 13. My grandmother had to work hard to provide for the family, and they faced many struggles, like living with other families who were not very nice.
I came to this country through a difficult journey, crossing mountains with a friend and a cousin. I didn't have legal documentation, so I had to cross illegally. I spent Christmas out in the mountains and eventually met my brother here.
I’ve struggled with feeling American enough here, and with feeling Mexican enough in Mexico. I worked hard to eliminate any accent in English because I was ashamed of being Mexican at some point. Due to these struggles, I don't feel like I fit in either culture. Also, dealing with differing values and beliefs between me and my mom has been hard. It even makes me feel shameful talking about it now.
I feel good about my journey, but I'm also aware that it might take some time to get there. I think about my struggles and obstacles, but I know I can get there. Family is important to me, and I never realized the emotional connection that comes with certain memories from my childhood.
I'm struggling with my identity and the balance between my Mexican culture and being born in the United States with immigrant parents. Growing up, I've been exposed to different ideas, views, and ways of thinking, which often conflicted with my family's values and beliefs. This has been difficult to manage, especially with my mom.
I selected three cards and one of them reminds me of Mexico, being Mexican, and what that means to me. Being Mexican will always be a part of me, and I feel really good and proud about it.
I picked this one because it reminds me of a bird, you know, birds are my favorite animal. Birds come back and forth freely between here and Mexico. It reminds me that there is pride in coming from two different cultures, and that birds are free to come back and forth.
I've been struggling to find my identity, and I often forget to think about myself. I want to create my own language and value system that fits for me, just like this lady who looks confident. I want to be okay with what fits for me without worrying about pleasing others or fitting labels. I just want to find balance within myself.
I remember noticing the difference in shoes at my elementary school, where most of my fellow students were Latinos, but there were some African-American students as well. They often wore branded shoes like Nike or Adidas, and I wished I had those too. My family was not well-off, and my parents didn't understand the significance of branded shoes. So, wearing low quality or non-branded shoes always made me feel inferior or left out.
I remember growing up and feeling like the brand of shoes I wore was important. My parents didn't seem to care about it as much as I did, and they would say things like 'At least you have shoes.' I had to wear the same shoes in our rancho, and I understood at an early age that my parents couldn't afford to buy expensive shoes for all four of us.
Well, I guess… My first question is do you understand Spanish? There are times when specific words or memories would be easier for me to express in Spanish.
I have been feeling tension and experiencing conflict within my family as immigrants. This has led to strong emotions like shame, embarrassment, and even pride in my culture. I'm just starting to open up about these difficult topics and wonder if you have any questions for me regarding counseling or how we should proceed.
I've been trying to become more spiritual, find peace within myself, and understand what makes sense for my life. This is hard for some of my family members to understand, and religion has some important connections to my parents. I'm struggling to reconcile the messages I've received about religion with my own experiences growing up in the US.
I remember playing Loteria with my family in Mexico. It always reminds me of the time spent at my grandma's house after church. We would play games like Loteria, poker, and other card games, even the little kids would join in. We played for money, using Pesos, and it would get really competitive but fun. It brings back many fond memories of Mexico and I still play it with my family here.
I used to play a lot of card games with my family back in the US and it brings up many good memories and competitiveness among family members.
I'm struggling with how to respond to my mom and dad when they say that school has changed me and it's affecting my religious beliefs. My family is very religious, specifically Catholic, and religion has always been a big part of our lives. I was raised Catholic and it has always felt like a safe and familiar place to me where I could connect with a higher being. I'm now trying to talk to others who may have had similar struggles.
I used to be religious, but after listening to some messages that didn't align with my values, I started to move away from it. Now, I am not religious and trying to find peace within myself.
I'm feeling conflicted about my identity as a Mexican-American. I've struggled with language barriers and cultural expectations from both sides. In Mexico, I'm not seen as fully Mexican, and in the United States, I'm often seen as just Mexican. I'm trying to find a balance between the two cultures and find a way to explain this to others and myself, as well as fitting in with my family.
Lately, I've been feeling really defensive and upset because of the political climate surrounding immigration issues. It's really affecting me because my family is a group of undocumented immigrants, and the negative messages being spread make me feel like they're directed at my family. It hurts me to know that people might believe these things about us, and I try my best to spread awareness and participate in marches and protests.
I feel a mix of pride and sadness when I think about my parents' journey to the US. They originally didn't plan to stay here but eventually became citizens. I never experienced the struggle of being undocumented, but I empathize with others who do, especially with the current situation. Sometimes, I get defensive when talking about my parents and their journey since they had to endure so much to give me this life.
I remember I had these shoes from a brand called Soda, but I think they were actually knockoffs. It makes me chuckle now that I think about it. I just wanted to fit in and be like my friends who had those shoes. Also, every summer, we'd go to Mexico for about a month during the break.
I've been feeling distressed lately, but I found people in school with similar experiences and have managed to navigate all the challenges. I've also shared the story of my parents and their journey.
I feel like I'm spending a lot of time preoccupied with certain thoughts, but I'm trying to still be a good therapist for myself and get out to do some activities.
Lately, I've been struggling with negative thoughts that seem to be taking over my life. I try to keep myself busy with daily activities like grocery shopping, meal preparation, or watching movies to block out these thoughts. However, they still manage to seep in and disrupt my life more frequently.
I'm fine, yeah. Yeah. But, when there's a pause, it seems to make it a little bit less intense.
As the patient, I'm struggling with the fact that there's no formula to deal with the situation I'm facing. It's on my mind, and I'm doing the best I can. I wish someone could tell me the end process, but unfortunately, no one has come back with the answer.
My partner and I have recently started attending couples counseling. Our relationship seemed okay on the surface, but it was clear that we weren't addressing issues that were deeper beneath the surface. Since beginning counseling, communication has gotten a lot easier and we've just started exploring these deeper issues.
I didn't feel like I was a participant any longer. I felt like I was just there. And it's not a nice feeling. I'm starting to feel more comfortable with my counsellor though.
I'm just not comfortable with what I'm doing right now and would rather be somewhere else. I thought I was capable of handling this situation with my coping mechanisms, but it turns out, I'm not.
Recently, I've been struggling with the idea of death and the uncertainty of the end of the road. Society tends to glorify death, and I just don't see it happening in the way everyone expects, surrounded by family and in a peaceful manner.
I have been feeling really terrified about this particular thing in my life.
I have been dealing with this disease and although I went on disability and took medications, I still feel helpless and wish there was something I could do to fight it.
I feel overwhelmed and frustrated because there's nothing I can do now to change the situation. It's an unpredictable situation in life and there's no magic button to make it better. I'm not unhappy, just sad at times, and I don't have anyone to talk about it.
I feel like dying is a very private issue and I have been reading books like Kubler Ross to understand it better. I don't think I'm good at denial and I push myself.
In the past year, I developed a heart condition and my blood pressure has gone out of control due to the medication. I've lost all the fat in my body because of the medication, and I've watched myself go from someone who is vibrant and alive to someone I don't know anymore. I don't know if there are words to describe that.
I'm struggling with the instability of life because of my physical health. I can easily get hit with fatigue or other problems, and it really affects me.
It will be ten years next month, when things didn't work anymore for me, and I'm finding I'm not doing well. I don't know if anyone is.
I am afraid to die, and I am just becoming aware of this fear. My whole belief system and my identity are in turmoil as I try to find the meaning of life for me now. There have been some medical changes, and I can no longer put off facing this issue.
I think these are easy issues to deal with when you're not faced with them or you think you're facing them far in the future. But the closer I get, I might think I'm backsliding. The hard thing is just trying to find hope.
I have something on my mind that I'd like to talk about.
Sometimes I can handle things well, but fatigue often makes it difficult for me. I desire stability and consistency in my life. When I'm not feeling well, I can cope with things better, but as soon as I start feeling better, I seem to struggle.
I've been having some health concerns that seem to be triggered by specific situations, like after a doctor's appointment. It doesn't just happen randomly during the day, but is induced by something (e.g., a situation or event).
I'm experiencing financial stress when I receive bills that my insurance doesn't cover or prescriptions that aren't paid for under my program. Also, my 86-year-old mother who is an alcoholic is another source of concern. I applied for Social Security in 1993 because I was overwhelmed by the stress of my job at a hospital.
Uhm, my mother cut me off. And, I'm afraid to get closer to her. We have a relationship. She, ah, fell and broke her leg last year...
I have a smoking addiction that's difficult to quit and find motivation to replace it with something else. I am a disabled gay male, living with my partner and suffering from AIDS. My medications are failing, and I'm unsure if I'll make it to my 50th birthday.
I know I should quit smoking, but there's a lot of issues in my life right now. Life itself right now is very overwhelming.
I've always been the giving person, but now I'm in a situation where I have to be on the receiving end. I don't want to deal with dying, but it's something I have to face, and it makes me feel very unsure.
I am beginning to face the reality that I may not be one of those people who are successful with medications, and it's really frustrating.
I've been struggling with fear and anxiety lately, and I've tried using self-talk to put my fear on hold for a few minutes. I've also thought about sharing my fears with someone else.
I've been feeling overwhelmed and really struggling with some difficult situations in my life. It's all just too much, and I don't know how to handle it.
I feel overwhelmed and unprepared for the challenges we're facing because I don't think our prior experiences have prepared us for it.
As a patient, I've been trying to cope with my situation by reading Bernie Seagal and other self-help resources. While they do provide some relief, I still feel like my own experience is unique and that there's no specific roadmap that can guide me through my emotional turmoil.
I'm feeling nice after my own counseling session this morning, realizing that I am in control of my destiny. I'm planning to not worry tonight and, if I do, I'll try to take a 15-minute break. Also, I want to continue being more open when I'm frightened or when I need help.
I'm finding some good things that are happening lately. I'm really appreciating the sunlight and the warmer weather. I made it through another winter and went through chemotherapy. It feels like a lot has happened.
I've been enjoying the great spring day, and I found it comforting to just walk and talk to people, even just for five minutes. However, I don't know if this feeling will last forever. I tried to tell Kevin that I'm afraid, but it's really hard for me.
I find it really hard to cope with the challenges that I've been facing lately.
I have a long day ahead and I'm trying to slow things down. I tend to do everything in one day, and then get exhausted for the next two days. I have three or four errands that can be done tomorrow. What should I do to reduce my stress and turmoil by just 5%?
I have a part-time job as a dog walker after graduating college. I enjoy being with the dogs. It's fun and it helps me get outside of myself. However, I'm afraid that two of the big dogs I walk might knock me over.
Lately, I've been feeling stuck in my career as a dog walker and sometimes it feels like I'm knocking my head against the wall.
I'm struggling with trying to make something work, but I don't know how to stop worrying about dealing with this thing. Can you help me?
As a patient, I have a day-by-day program related to AIDS that I try to read for inspiration. I don't read it every day, but I do read something inspirational daily.
As a patient, I've been reading philosophy related to living just for today for a number of years. I am aware of the saying 'Just for the day, I live through this day only.' However, I feel like I should practice it more.
I've been feeling overwhelmed about the future, and even though I've tried certain things to help lessen my anxiety, sometimes it just doesn't seem to work.
I've been feeling angry and like things aren't working out for me. I feel like my own buttons have been moved, and I'm not even aware of where they are anymore. I can't seem to find the joy button anymore.
I find it easier to discover my feelings and thoughts by doing something rather than just searching for them.
I don't feel like a participant in life any longer. I want to be a participant in life, let go of some anger, be less afraid, and feel less stressed out by the prospect of dying.
I have been trying to abandon all those feelings and turmoil I have been experiencing. There are moments and half hours when I seem to be able to do that and sometimes even a few good hours.
Lately, I've been experiencing a lot of emotional turbulence, and it's become more constant than it was before. I just wish for some stability in my life, one way or another.
I have been struggling with not having a productive routine in my life. I used to have a fulfilling job or go to graduate school, and that gave me a sense of purpose. Now that I don't have that, it's hard for me to find something meaningful to replace it. I thought not working would be fun, but it's really not.
I would like to go back to graduate school and/or work, but my health has not been consistently good.
I've always been a very innovative person, but lately, I feel like I'm running out of innovation. I've also been smoking for various reasons, and although I was a counselor before and have some insights, I'm struggling with these issues now.
I'm feeling extremely angry and frightened lately. My energy levels are low, and I have been smoking to help boost them. I'm a recovering alcoholic, and I don't know what to replace my addiction with. I'm feeling ambivalent about giving it up.
I smoke about three packs a day, and I don't think I can cut it back. When I try, I go right back to where I was. I've quit twice before, but I was very...
Lately, there have been so many changes in my life, and I'm having a hard time finding my purpose. I used to be a vibrant and active participant in life, but I feel like I'm not anymore.
I have an extended family, but when we had a family breakdown, it could've made me fall apart. However, it actually made me stronger.
I've got some really close friends who I consider family, and in the past, my actual family was way too important to me. Their value was much higher than it should have been. However, now, it's not the case anymore.
I'm glad to spend some time with my family, but I also spend quality time with other people to get my emotional needs met. However, lately, being with my family has been more stressful than enjoyable.
I'm dealing with a lot of stress lately and I try to spend time with my extended family as they act as friends for me. We often visit each other's houses.
It's hard for me because most people are working during the day and it's challenging to have a long day.
I had a wonderful experience, but I'm struggling with moving on to this whole new life. I'm trying to go back to where I was before to do it again, but I can't because I'm not there anymore, and I don't understand it.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with all the unnecessary things in my life, and I'm struggling to let go and start fresh. I think it might be a good idea to just scrap it all and begin anew.
I'm feeling like, 'Okay, I'm in control,' and I don't have a lot of control in my life. But, you know, I can kind of, like, control the picture of what my life is from now on, you know?
I've had a really busy week, and my plan for tomorrow is to take it a little easy so that I can make it through the week.
I'm leaving here with a much more positive attitude.
I think doing relaxation exercises more often would help me. I've been trying to be like a hero in my relationships and not talk about my feelings with others. But it hasn't been working well for me. Now, I allow myself to cry and be open with people.
You know, I don't feel well, and Kevin always says I look healthy. But I have this whole people-pleasing thing that I don't want to sound like a whiny, sick person, and I don't want to ask for help because the help has been slow in coming.
I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately because of a new responsibility at work, and it's gotten to the point where I'm ambivalent about living. I feel like I've been through a washer for the past ten years and I am just completely exhausted.
I'm physically and psychically tired, and I feel like I'm out of tricks. When I ask for help, the fatigue lifts.
I've had this disease for ten years now, and I'm 49 years old. I might make it to my 50th birthday, but a lot of my friends haven't been so lucky. I've worked with doctors and patients in the past, and seen wonderful people lose their lives to it. My partner and I are in therapy, but I find it hard to deny the reality of my situation.
I need to talk about dying. It's not exactly the most wonderful subject on earth, but it's the intimacy issue that I need to deal with right now. I don't think there's anything any more intimate in the relationship than letting go.
I've been having these feelings of fear and hurt lately, and I think I've moved through stages of anger, depression, and grieving. Now, I believe I'm beginning to accept whatever is causing these emotions.
I'm struggling to find something inside myself and I'm not sure if it exists anymore. I'd like to talk about my relationships, particularly my partner, as that might be more doable.
I am in a relationship with Kevin for nine years, and I'm happy with it. He is an architect and there's an age difference between us; I'm 49 and he's 32.
I have a wonderful father-son partner relationship with someone who has similar interests as me. He's becoming a partner at his firm, which requires him to work incredibly long hours from seven in the morning until seven or eight at night. This makes it difficult for us as we don't have a lot of time together.
I have been trying to connect with my partner since my condition has been affecting our daily routine. However, he is a wonderful person but not very open and his way to deal with my disease is not very helpful.
I've been struggling with a problem and I don't know how to deal with it. I feel like no one understands what I am going through and it's causing me a lot of distress.
I think part of the reason I smoked is because it gives me a pause. But, I'm not sure how serious the problem is in terms of causing health problems.
Because of my medication and my disease, I'm a candidate to have a heart attack any day. The medication has elevated my cholesterol level up to a dangerous level. My father died of a heart attack. My blood pressure has elevated from one of the other medications. And finally, smoking is a contributing factor. I've been through two programs for smoking but they didn't work.
I used to have a really bad habit of chewing on big pens. I made a promise to my partner to stop doing it, but it's been difficult.
I am planning to repaint my house, which was previously white, but now is kind of like tobacco yellow. After that, I'll smoke on the back porch. I think I know the right things to do, but it's just...
Lately, I have been feeling a little overwhelmed in life, and I am trying to follow a one-day-at-a-time philosophy. However, it sometimes feels like my understanding of the philosophy is quite shallow.
I recently finished a course of chemotherapy to reduce my viral load, and now I have to start my medications all over again. The social security system has been really difficult for me to navigate both for getting on and off.
I'm struggling financially and rely on social security for medications and housing subsidies. I tried applying for grad school but wasn't successful because of past loans that were excused when I went on disability. It feels like nothing has really worked out well for me in the past year.
I've been experiencing a series of failures lately, but surprisingly I don't feel depressed. I've been depressed before and I know my symptoms. People have been asking if I'm depressed from these failures but I feel like I'm not going through that again.
I used to work as an AIDS case manager for five years, and it was really wonderful work. I felt really committed and passionate about my job, but lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and like I'm taking on too much.
I've been having a lot of fear lately and it's difficult to face. However, I'm trying to gradually extend the time I spend not thinking about it, so I can have more bearable moments. I am also transitioning from a tough period to a better one, with my energy levels rising.
I can tell that I've been feeling better. I've been on the go today since 6:30 this morning, whereas yesterday, I would've been back on the couch by 8. You get to know your body after a while.
Lately, I have been feeling like my blood work doesn't accurately represent how my body is truly feeling. When I engage in activities that are more altruistic in nature, I am able to put my health concerns in the background and feel better.
I've been feeling this way for a while now, but I'm not sure what to do about it. I think I can manage, but I'm really starting to worry about the impact it might have on my life.
I'm having trouble dealing with peer pressure from my friends at school. They often encourage me to skip class and I don't know how to respond. Every time I try to refuse, they keep pressuring me.
I don't like confrontation, so I would probably just walk away instead of getting into one. But I'm kind of scared to do that.
I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed about jumping right into this, but I think I can start by just speaking up and talking. They are at the back, just walking away.
I really want to graduate because I want to keep playing basketball and this is part of my goals. However, during breaks, people say mean things about others and it doesn't feel right to me, but I usually stay silent. I want to stand up and say something, but I'm not sure how to do it without being confrontational.
I've been feeling really low lately, as if I'm at a one or two on a scale of emotional wellbeing because I've been letting all my problems accumulate for so long.
Today, I feel like I'm at a four or five, but I want to be at a 10. I think I need to be an advocate for myself first before I go and help other people.
I recently realized that I and my friends have been missing a lot of school, so I have thought about telling them that we should all focus on staying in school and attending classes.
I haven't been going to school lately, and it's affecting my grades. I've been hanging out with my friends instead, skipping class to destress. They usually invite me, and I feel pressured to join them.
I feel pulled in both directions, and I haven't been able to express the part of me that wants to stay in school.
I recently met my counsellor named Camille for the first time and introduced myself as Mayumi.
I've been stressed out from both school and home life, but mainly school as my grades have been dropping a little bit, and my friends have become a really big influence.
I'm stressed about two things at school - my grades and my friends. I'm in the basketball team, so I've been getting closer with my friends, but they tend to be mean and bully others. I feel bad because I don't do anything about it, and I don't agree with their actions. Regarding my grades, I've missed school a few times, which has put me behind with turning in assignments.
Lately, I've been experiencing a lot of pressure and stress. I have this fear of being left out, so I silence my own voice and go along with others, even when I don't agree with them. This has led to negative consequences, such as skipping classes, declining grades, and causing trouble at home, making me feel overwhelmed.
I feel confident when I'm in my classes, especially during group projects. I usually know the subject matter well and I can speak up and allocate tasks for our project. This is the only time I feel good about speaking up for myself and others in an academic setting.
I feel like I'm too scared to say anything because I think my friends won't like me if I stand up for myself, and I'm scared of being alone without any friends.
I feel like I need to speak up for a while, I know what's right. And then just not like think about the consequences of what's going to happen because at least I know what was right. But it's also fun because I knew they would listen to me and I knew what was going to happen if I told them to do something or if I like gave them something to do, like, for us to do together, we would all listen and be like one.
I have been developing leadership skills and a strong sense of advocacy for myself and others. I am not only worrying about myself, but also thinking about the well-being of others. I want to become a stronger leader and advocate for what's right.
I've been struggling with standing up for others when I hear something mean being said. I want to say something but I'm scared and don't want to come across as confrontational.
I am discovering my natural leadership skills and I can be an advocate for myself and others. However, I feel stressed and overwhelmed when I am silenced, and I tend to hold back due to fear of being confrontational.
I've been struggling with peer pressure lately. My friends keep asking me to skip classes and go to McDonald's with them. Today, I tried to tell them that I wasn't hungry and that the class was important to me, but they didn't really understand.
I want to have good grades so I can keep playing basketball, but my friends keep saying it's not important. I want to advocate for myself and make them understand that it's important to me, even if they don't find it important.
I have two problematic areas: one is getting good grades because I'm missing school, and the other is my friends calling other people's names, which I don't like. This usually happens during breaks or recess.
I feel like people pass by me between third and fourth period during lunch time, and they want to pick on or say stuff to me. They don't necessarily hear it, but it still makes me feel uncomfortable.
I've never thought of myself as a leader and no one has called me that before, but Mayumi pointed out that I am actually exhibiting leadership skills in my work. It feels empowering now that I can lead people, but it's surprising to me.
I used to watch my little brother and my cousins when they were younger, and I would be in charge when we went to the park. It felt like I was leading a group of children, and it took a lot of patience and structure.
I felt like it's different when I was leading the activities and being in charge at a family gathering at the park. I felt good being a boss and directing people.
I recently made some changes in my life, like redoing my garden and painting my house with different colors. I find it easier to make changes when they are outside of my own being.
I find it easier to change when I have partners or friends helping me, but now that I'm trying to make changes just for myself, it's much harder for me to get started and keep the momentum going.
I've noticed that most people who lose weight end up gaining it back within a year. Also, I've observed that when people stop exercising, their bodies stiffen up. It feels like there's a heavy weight pulling my intention away from staying committed to my goals.
I feel like taking care of myself would bring satisfaction, but I struggle with doing things for myself. It's easier to help others instead.
I sometimes feel like making changes in my life won't really help me find a partner, and I'm unsure if it's worth the effort. Even though I try not to want a relationship, there's still a part of me that hopes for it.
I partly don’t make changes because I’m not very good at relationships, so I don't have to get into that hot water. Also, I don't see many good relationships out there.
I've noticed that I don't cry anymore and it feels like my body is telling me that I'm shut down. I need some kind of miraculous experience to help me open up again. It's been about five years since I gave up hope of ever finding a partner.
I have been shutting myself down emotionally and it doesn't feel right. I would like to live my life with an open heart and be able to have a good cry when I'm sad. However, I find it hard to make myself cry even when I feel sad.
I used to be able to get emotional and cry while reading books or watching movies, but I can't anymore. I feel like I would be healthier if I ate better, practiced yoga regularly, and could have a good cry over a book or a movie.
I'm struggling with taking good care of myself and making healthy choices like eating vegetables, not snacking, being active, and exercising. I want to focus on improving my relationship with myself.
I can't even imagine the next five years. I can only imagine this afternoon, and maybe tomorrow. I'm not looking beyond tomorrow afternoon, just focusing on this short window of time.
I was pretty pleased with myself for doing my yoga practice this morning. It does hurt, but it felt good too. The part that doesn't hurt feels good, and it's nice to do something just for me.
Well, I don’t want to be sour grapes to you about it, but I don't have very much good relationship role modeling in my life to make me think or just of my own previous marriages experience. Like I wouldn't want to quite do it like that again. However, life on my own is pretty amazing, but I miss kisses. I want to have a relationship and don't want to have a relationship at the same time.
I've been making changes in my eating habits primarily to find a relationship, rather than for my own well-being. I've also tried yoga with the hope that it would help with my pain, but I don't have faith that it does or would.
I feel stuck and trapped in my life, like I'm caught in a trap. There are things I want, but there are also reasons why I shouldn't pursue them. This conflict has left me feeling completely stuck.
I'm sitting here because I want to get inspired. I want to be more proud of myself by taking care of myself better.
I expressed my desire to improve my eating habits, and I have identified three things I want to change. I feel confident that I can commit to these changes, as I'm usually good with commitments. I rate my importance of making these changes at a 7.5 on a scale of 0 to 10.
I think a lot of times it's encouragement and support from another person that helps me to make a change in my life.
I've been struggling with making changes in my life and I've noticed that some people around me don't really want to help me make good choices. I'm not sure what to do about it.
I have decided what I'm going to do, but I'm not sure how I can build on it and come up with other ideas. I will try asking for a dream of guidance.
I feel stuck and can't make up my mind about a decision. Whenever I think of a reason to do it, I immediately think of a reason not to do it and I end up not taking any action.
I don't know how to change my eating habits and practice yoga, or I would have already done it. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm hesitant because I don't see why things would be different in four days.
I've thought about making changes in my life, but I haven't come up with a plan that worked for myself. I feel like I don’t have the answers and need some guidance.
Sometimes, I feel good and happy during the doing of a task, even if I am not very committed to it. I feel glad that I did it, similar to the feeling I get after flossing. But I don't want to make any commitments today.
I have been feeling self-destructive lately and I am puzzled about why I don't do things more often to better myself. Life just seems really hard and I want to destroy myself partly, but not completely.
Sometimes it feels good to be out of life, but on the other hand, life is cool and pretty amazing. I am one of those Pisces people who have a hard time making progress. I am mostly thinking about self-care and taking care of myself in my personal space.
I would say that I find it important to eat more vegetables and less carbohydrates, and if I had to rate its importance on a scale from 0 to 10, I would give it a 7.5.
I am trying to decide which college to attend. I have a few choices like the University of Illinois, Duke, Perdue, Yukon, or the University of Tennessee. All of these colleges have great basketball programs and strong academics, which are important to me.
I think other teenagers think that way but I feel that I'm special as a person. I'm happy with myself and I feel that there's something unique about everyone.
I have been told by many people that I have a good outlook on things for my age. Some people just live day by day, but I feel that I always choose the best way out of everything. Being with my family influences this a lot.
I am very close to my nephew, Scott, and my sister, Kelly. Scott has lived with me since he was born, and he brings a smile to my face on bad days. However, my family says I'm always on the go, and I hardly have any time for them.
As a 14-year-old, I feel that my parents, grandparents, and older sister have greatly influenced me to become who I am today. They have always done their best to guide me, and my sister has taught me right from wrong through her experiences.
I don't compare myself to people but I think my mom and dad, being strong individuals, reflect who I am.
I am a freshman with a hectic schedule, and I get tired, which affects my performance in basketball practice. I know I could do much better if I wasn't so tired, and it bothers me because I feel like I should be able to manage my time better to maintain my social life, participate in sports, and keep up with school.
I am currently a freshman with eight classes, sometimes with homework in each of them. I am also part of the basketball team, practicing daily and having games two to three times a week, including tournaments on weekends. In grade school, I was able to manage this kind of schedule and even made it to the high honor roll. But now, I'm finding it difficult to keep up with everything.
I've been feeling like I'm not doing as well in school as I used to in grade school, even though I still have good grades, like As and Bs.
Hi. I'm a freshman struggling with managing my grades, sports, and social life. It's difficult to find a balance, as grades should come first, but I also need to maintain a social life.
I recently started high school and I'm struggling to balance my academic life, social life, basketball activities, and family time. I have eight classes a day, homework from most of them, and it's challenging to fit everything within a 24-hour day. It's very tiring.
I find it really tiring to manage my time between sports, school, and personal life. When I'm at sports, I worry about getting home, having enough time to eat, do my homework, and get to bed early. It's hard to put myself in more than one place at one time, and I struggle with managing everything in a limited amount of time.
As a high school student, I feel like I should manage my time more efficiently. I'm not the only one who's going through this situation, as I believe all teenagers face this problem at some point, whether it's because of sports, drama club, or any other activity. I think it's just a stage that we would have to get over.
I think it's a good stage because once you get older and after you've went through this with just the minor stuff, you, it, it's gonna help you better when you get older, when you get a family and have a job and everything. Well, I have a good family and good friends and, like, all my sport coaches are really positive about everything and I know that I'm not the only one, so that's why it really doesn't bother me as much. However, I just have a problem with, like, keeping what priorities should come first. I know my family does definitely come first but it's like it's hard.
I knew there'd be a difference between grade school and high school, but I didn't realize how big of a difference there would be. My friends have changed a lot, but that doesn't affect me much since I make friends easily. The main issue is that I can't balance my time between my family, friends, sports, and school - something is always getting left out.
Well, I don't get upset with myself, but it bothers me a little when I can't call my best friend every day and talk to her due to my other priorities. This issue of something or someone being left out always affects me. Although I try to go back and spend time with that person, in doing so, something else is being left out.
I feel bad about it because I can't be everywhere at one time.
I've had a wonderful conversation with a person from Canada named Steven. He wants to take some advice I've shared with him about compassion, examining alternatives, and always being yourself to share with the young people he encounters in his work. I feel good about the conversation, and I'm okay with him sharing my words of wisdom.
I sometimes feel overwhelmed with my schedule and feel bad about leaving someone out, like my mom. But when it happens, I make it up to them by spending quality time together, like going out to dinner or watching a movie.
Sometimes, I feel bad when I cannot manage my schedule properly and leave someone or something out. But, I try to rectify the situation by spending extra time with friends or family or practicing basketball when I miss a practice.
I feel like I've made good judgment on myself in the situations I've faced, and my friends often come to me for advice.
I feel like I'm always on the go and I need to do something constantly. My body is used to being active and when I'm sitting, it triggers me to stop resting and go do whatever is available. I think it's good to be active, but I also believe that everyone needs some time to relax.
I don't know. It just happens. I mean, there's not really anything that triggers it. I just feel like, if I feel that I could do it and I could handle it, then I'll do it.
I feel happy when I'm with my friends. We go out, see movies, go to the mall, go to anywhere and we have fun. However, the hectic lifestyle I have is bothering me and I'm tired of being so run down.
I feel that I should always be on the go because there's always something to do or something that needs to be done. I've never liked to just sit around and not do anything. When I do have free time, I think I should be doing more activities instead of just sitting on a couch and relaxing.
I feel like sometimes I get a bit run down, but overall, I'm a very loyal, honest, and supportive person. I'm always there for my friends, regardless of what's going on in their lives. One thing I would like to change is to spend more time with my grandparents and family.
I've been brought up to be the best I can be all my life, and it's now a part of who I am. It's like my second nature, and it's difficult for the story of myself to be rocked. I know that my friends look up to me and my strength.
Well, one of my friends, like she's one really close to me and she's like a sister. She always tells me, you know, you have a good outlook on things. You know, I wish I could do decision making more like you. Instead of getting myself into this, like situations that I have a hard time getting myself out of when there's another way that I could have solved it that would have been easier.
As a patient, I've always known what I can handle and what I can't, but I haven't really tested my limits.
I'm not sure who has the red pencil marking in my margins and telling me that I'm doing something wrong. I feel like I have the answers, but I'm still seeking guidance.
I've been trying to be a superwoman, taking on too much responsibility and now I feel overwhelmed. I think the alternative is being seen as a stupid woman, which I don't want.
I think I'm just trying to push it too far. I'm trying to do too many things and not really stepping back and asking myself what I truly want. I might be putting too many expectations on myself, trying to do everything and do it perfectly.
I feel like I have to do all these things, probably because I put all of this pressure on myself. I find that I have so many responsibilities as a professional woman, a mother, and a wife. And with so many roles to play, I think I just stress myself out by adding more and more agendas on my plate.
I came to you because I think you're great and helpful. I've been feeling so stressed trying to balance being a mother, wife, and professional woman while working in the school system and managing my college.
I am struggling to keep up with my husband's activities and the other day, I realized that I haven't even gone shopping and there wasn't any food in the house to serve our guests. I was so embarrassed and felt like I can't do it all. I see you handling everything so well, and I hope you can help me figure out how to handle things better.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with all the responsibilities and tasks I have. I'm starting to question if I really need to finish everything off. Can you help me understand why I'm taking all this on?
I've been struggling with the Superwoman syndrome and it's been making me feel overwhelmed. It seems like the solution should be simple, but I'm not able to handle it with finesse.
I've gone through it, and continue to affect it. It's almost like I've become addicted to it. I do all these things and everyone says how well I did, but then they just ask me to do more and it never seems to end.
I feel like from an early age, I've been conditioned to be selfless and care for others as a woman. I want to help people, make them feel good, and take on many responsibilities. But trying to carry all of these expectations is becoming overwhelming and deadening for me.
I feel like I'm carrying a heavy burden around on my shoulders, and though people seem to admire how I bear up, I don't want to bear up. I want to go through life with a certain amount of balance and a sense that I'm managing.
I've been feeling like my life is a constant balancing act, and sometimes it gets to be too much. It tips too much the other way, and I'm struggling to get a handle on things.
I've been feeling extremely overwhelmed and have been moving at a frantic pace lately. If I were given a billion dollars to set some priorities, I'm not quite sure what they would be right now. I need help figuring out what is driving me so I can find balance in my life.
I've been feeling overwhelmed with balancing my roles as a wife, mother, and professional woman. I've been thinking about the possibility of delegating some tasks, like food shopping or house chores, to my family so I wouldn't feel so responsible for everything and can focus on the most important things to me.
I just kept saying yes, of course, you know, I can handle that, yes, yes, yes, and I think the answer is to say no to things. I think that we are family, and a good family team, and I think we need to all sort of step back and look at the things that need to be done. I just need to say 'I need some help in some of these areas.' Not only here, at work I have the same problem.
I was really scared about not being able to breathe during the experience, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. But there were parts that I found scary.
I just had an interesting session, and I feel better now.
I feel like I can breathe better now.
I want to say thank you for letting me witness that amazing experience. But, I have a question. When you do this kind of work, are you usually more secluded, without so many external noises? Did you even notice those noises like coughs and footsteps during the session?
I still wanted to protect you and look at people go.
I felt pretty good about hiding actually, but I'm not sure how it's connected to my abuse. I'm sensing something else now in my body that I haven't felt before. It's like down here in my lower torso and it feels like an inaudible light.
I feel good now after the part that was blocked when the box was inside has come out. However, I still want the box to go away.
I feel like I want the box to go away, but we're running out of time right now.
I think it's okay, just the box can be opened, it can be on… it can be just right there. It doesn't want to be in there anymore either. I want to check with all the parts that were scared about doing this and see how they're doing.
I have this part of me that takes me out of my body sometimes, like just now. It happens when it feels like things are going to be too much or too overwhelming.
I've been feeling overwhelmed lately, and I'm not sure if it's the fear itself or the feelings that come with it that are too much to handle.
I have been keeping a part of myself safe and protected, but now I'm willing to consider trying a different approach wherein my fear doesn't overwhelm me completely. I just need some guidance on how to proceed.
I feel overwhelmed by the scared part of me, and my heart doesn't want to see what happens. But now it doesn't seem so overwhelming after you suggested taking my heart to a safe place until we're done.
I am afraid to find out why I feel disgusting in a certain task, but I really want to know if there's a reason behind it.
I have a part inside me that has been keeping a secret reason for a long time. It has caused me a lot of distress and negative feelings. It's scary for me to confront that part, but it has become less scary now. I want to heal it and get rid of all the disgusting feelings.
I have a scared part that thinks I am between 7 and 11 years old. I tried to tell it my actual age but it doesn't seem to understand or know what that number means.
I used to feel overwhelmed when I was younger, but now I think I can handle more than what I could handle when I was between 7 and 11 years old. The issue seems to be resolved now, and I don't feel as much anxiety or discomfort as before.
I am not sensing the fear as much now, but I still feel like the fear might come back when I go to the knocking. It's like they made room to go there, but there's a decision to come back to the fear and it's just ready to jump back if necessary.
I feel like there's a box inside my body, and I don't know what it is or why it's there. I am cautiously curious about it.
I feel like there's a part of me that knows what's going on but is trapped inside, unable to find a way out or express itself.
I am not sure if I opened the box, but there's this thing darting around in there and it's kind of disgusting.
I don't know, it's kind of strange. It's like an incomplete kind of a life form, I don't know. It's like some kind of insect and I'm not really sure if I should stay with the feeling or not.
I don't think it's a part of me, and I don't know how it got there. It doesn't feel like it is and it's not saying anything when I ask about it.
I've been feeling that I was evil since I was seven, and it has something to do with the church.
I believed I was evil, and I don't know why I invited it in. I remember I was in third grade when it started.
I didn't really get distracted by the noises around me. I was focused, but my mind was wandering here and there. People have said that my strength is very strong, and it's wonderful to see my ability to feel as a man.
I had this meeting, and I was worried that people would lose respect for me during my presentation tomorrow. I asked for some feedback, and nobody seemed to have a negative view on me.
I'm feeling mixed emotions about embracing a certain aspect of myself. Part of me wants to, but another part is reluctant and wants to put up a fight.
I am feeling curious about something but I don't know what it is, and there's a lot of emotion coming with it.
I'm feeling some emotions, but I don't know what they are. I've been hiding these emotions because I can't identify them.
I saw something that wasn't hiding anymore. It looked like something partially formed and dead.
I feel like there's a part of me that doesn't know what it is or what to do. It's just there, and I'd like to help it find its purpose or destiny.
I consider myself an introvert and I definitely need alone time. There are days when I've been around a lot of people in class, and I just want to be by myself and not feel judged or looked at by others. I can just be unique in my own space.
I often feel drained by the judgment while working on something for school or work, and it's like my batteries need recharging. I feel judged even when working alone because I worry about how the work will be viewed by others. However, when I'm at home, interacting with a piece of art like a book or a song feels less judgmental and being alone is a pleasurable place.
I didn't put too much thought into having a more active social life growing up because it felt okay for me to be alone. I was happy to be at school, interacting with people and then go home to be alone in my room.
I had a chance to reflect and think about the ways that I interact with people and myself. When I received criticism, it was very compassionate and came from a place of wanting to see me succeed, rather than just telling me that I can't do something. My boss was very compassionate and supportive, and she saw something in me. She would guide me on how I could improve and be a better instructor.
I recently experienced the loss of my dad, and it has really impacted my life. It's made me realize the importance of compassion and the value of being part of someone's growth, which is why I want to be a counselor.
I feel like my dad's death changed a lot of my priorities. I had just finished college and was working in a coffee shop. I had friends coming from overseas and had a really free and wild summer. I was in my early 20s and enjoyed having few responsibilities and just focused on having fun.
I talked about how I don't want to make art my job, but rather keep it as my joy outside of my work. I also mentioned how I started working with adults with disabilities which was more fulfilling than just making art. I feel like finding meaning in art and creativity is an essential part of being present with someone.
I've recently been working with people with developmental disabilities, and I've found a lot of joy and passion in it. It feels meaningful to me, like I'm making a more significant impact and working with a community in need. Social justice is important to me, and being able to create deep relationships and learn about myself in the process has been really rewarding.
I find it nice to feel like I'm floating in the void as it feels freeing. It allows me to let go of the tension in my muscles and relax. I also used to listen to music with headphones when I was younger to be in my own world.
I've recently been getting more into music as a way to avoid the outside world's pressures. It reminds me of a time when I didn't have many responsibilities and could just lose myself in the music. Putting on headphones acts like a shield that keeps me from engaging with the outside world.
I find that when I listen to aggressive music, I can let everything else wash away and just focus on the visceral experience. It helps me feel more in the moment, and I don't think too much about my feelings.
Growing up, I did not do well in school, which was a sore spot for me. My teacher would mock me in front of the entire class, which made me feel miserable and hurt my self-esteem. I have strong memories of talking to myself, feeling stupid, and thinking that I can't do anything right.
I've always struggled with self-expression and following the rules in structured environments. My parents tried to help by providing tutors and after-school programs, which only led to more frustration. Eventually, I was diagnosed with ADD and put on Ritalin. It helped me academically at first, but as I needed stronger doses, it became difficult for me to socialize with people.
I’ve been part of music scenes and I have friends who’ve done extensive touring. I know that lifestyle is not for me, as I need to be in bed at a reasonable hour and get eight hours of sleep. Ten years ago, touring with a band might have seemed appealing, but not now.
I've been reevaluating my life after my dad's passing, and I've realized that I enjoy music and art in a low-pressure, pleasure-focused way rather than treating it like work. When I put effort into something, it feels like it's giving me more in return.
I'm in a relationship that started after my dad passed away. Initially, it was a long-distance relationship before my partner moved closer to me. I feel like the relationship is leading me towards intimacy and better connections with others.
I'm worried if I'm taking charge of my life in the right way since I feel committed to my career and I'm questioning my future self. I'm on the right path right now, but when I was in art school, I had a nagging voice telling me maybe this isn't right, so I ignored it thinking it's normal self-doubt.
I have been taking the time to self-reflect and discuss my thoughts and feelings with my therapist. I've been trying to understand why I'm doing the things I'm doing and what is meaningful to me. I've been considering going to grad school, possibly getting a PhD, but I know that taking that path will mean letting go of other things, like being in a band or participating in art shows.
Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the road less taken and the freedom to do things like spending six months in Vietnam. I've had some similar experiences in the past, like studying abroad.
I was born in California, and both my parents have backgrounds in the arts. I am now working as a graphic designer. My dad was a potter but changed paths to work in business. Growing up, I had a lot of support from my parents who encouraged creativity and took nontraditional paths in their careers.
As a child, I was a very performative kid, doing impressions and voices, and my parents encouraged my artistic side by putting me in theater classes. They also always provided me sketchbooks and allowed me to express myself freely without pushing me to learn any specific drawing principles.
Growing up, my household valued creativity and out-of-the-box thinking over traditional academics. However, when I went to a more liberal elementary school, I struggled with staying focused on projects and in class. I often found myself daydreaming or doodling.
I feel like I've been able to create space for my partner to follow their dreams, and we've both been able to maintain our individuality while supporting each other. Our relationship has grown, and I think it will continue to grow in the future. It feels great to have such a supportive person on my journey.
I feel good about living together with my partner because when I have a rough day at school, I can come home and talk to her about it. We can vent and get things off our chest. Also, having that support from a romantic partner is important for my growth.
I've found that focusing on my personal growth has been a great way to improve not only myself but also my relationships with others, like friends, family, and partners. As I look back, I can see how I've become better at navigating interpersonal situations as I grow older.
I became really obsessed with music, and I used that obsession to learn everything about every genre possible. It made me feel smart and intelligent. However, I think I drifted away from interpersonal connections and socialization, which might have been helpful to me.
I mean, I had friends that I ate lunch with at school and had similar interests. But if I wasn’t talking to somebody that I felt really comfortable with, I didn’t feel comfortable engaging.
I used to avoid engaging with people, feeling constantly on edge and unresponsive to most things. If someone called my name, I'd freeze up, fearing embarrassment. I mostly gave one-word answers and focused on my schoolwork, as my confidence in that area grew. However, my creative side diminished during this time.
I spent a lot of my time not being good at school and I felt like I had to make up for it or change the way people viewed me, so that became my focus and purpose in life. It was difficult during that time because it was all about finding social groups, so I would just go to school and straight home, not really interacting with people outside of school.
I always had headphones on, listening to music whenever I had a chance instead of talking to people. Even during school breaks when it was time for homework or just chatting, I would put on my headphones and start my work.
I have gained self-awareness by reading a book, and I can relate myself to the main character who is kind of a jerk. It forced me to look in the mirror and evaluate my actions. During this period, distractions weren't working well, and I had to be fully present with who I am.
I have been struggling since my friend passed away. His death made me realize that life is short and can end anytime. It forced me to take charge of my life, but I often find myself thinking about what I could have done differently if he was still here.
I feel worried about the uncertainty of life, like I could get hit by a bus or get sick any day. My friend died of breast cancer at 32, and it made me realize there's no guarantee in life. I want to live and experience things, travel or go out, rather than just sit and wait.
I've been forced to look in the mirror and evaluate what I've been doing with my life. I quit drinking for a while and started working with developmental disabilities. However, looking at this experience as a turning point is difficult for me.
I have a point of contention in my relationship regarding our different perspectives. I don't want to hurt her, but I think a lot about how things would be if certain events hadn't happened. It's tough to deal with all of it, but it's worth it at the same time.
I feel like my life is in a much better place now, and I'm much more self-aware. But there was a time when I was shaken to the core, and I had to drink in order to feel okay.
As a patient, I feel like I'm being pulled in two different directions when I spend time with my various groups of friends. They all seem to reflect different aspects of myself, and I'm not sure how to deal with this internal struggle.
I think the first kind of thing that I'm noticing is like, umm, I'm feeling a lot of tension, and I can feel like almost, like, my jaw is clenched. And I remember kind of waking up every morning with my jaw clenched and trying to learn to notice and be aware of my jaw.
I tried making a career out of my artistic and music background, but it sucked the joy out of it and started feeling like a chore. Now, I am studying to be a counselor and like the idea of doing research projects since I can follow my own interests.
I've been struggling with my decision of not pursuing a career as a professional artist, but I recently watched a speaker and talked to a friend who's a comedian. They said that your passion doesn't need to be your job.
As a grad student, I put a lot of time and energy into my program which I really enjoy and feel that I grow a lot from. I also get a lot of personal inspiration from it. In my free time, I make sure to see some art, like going to museums.
I really enjoy visiting art galleries and looking at various pieces of art. It's like giving my brain a massage as I admire the artwork and think about the artist's intentions behind it. I love breaking down the technical aspects of each piece and discussing why the artist chose a certain artistic approach. It's a great way to take my brain out of its usual mode of thinking and indulge in a sensory experience.
I've been trying to take good care of myself by setting aside time to enjoy some good food and trying out new flavors. I even sometimes take the time to drive into Los Angeles and go to a restaurant I've heard a lot about, just to experience something different.
I am feeling more pressured and guilty about not being a good student. My drug usage has increased, and I am constantly on edge about failing and disappointing my parents.
When I was younger, my parents noticed that I was creative and signed me up for a speech and debate workshop over the summer. I turned out to be really good at public speaking, especially with humorous performances. However, as I started to withdraw, I became unsure whether people actually liked my humor or were making fun of me.
I've been called a weirdo at every stage of my life. I use humor as a way to keep myself liked by others and to cope with the frustration of being smart and well-read. It's an adaptive way to handle my surroundings.
I remember during the end of that summer, when my friends left and I got kicked out of my apartment, I got the phone call that my dad had cancer. Then, two weeks later, another call that he had a seizure and headed into the hospital. A week and a half later, my dad passed away. I started a relationship, had the service, and broke my leg. I had to deal with my knee, support my family, and I felt like I was being pulled in different directions.
I was a carefree guy in San Francisco, but then I had to deal with my dad's cancer and death, and my leg injury. I continued to push things away by moving to Berlin briefly to work as an artist, but things didn't work out there and when I moved back home, it was not easy.
I had a situation with my dad recently when we were working in the yard together. Instead of just hanging out and getting to know each other like we used to, he started treating me like I was still a teenager and he was the teacher. It's making me feel frustrated and angry because I'm an adult now and shouldn't be treated like that.
I feel like my partner is treating me as if I'm in a different phase of life than I am, and it's making me uncomfortable because I am an adult.
As a patient, I realize that my partner has a hard time understanding a certain issue. I think it has to do with their cultural background, which is mostly Swedish, with a little bit of English and German. I would like to know how someone from a Swedish family might react to someone returning after being away for some time.
I think though that like, fish and guests stink after three days. I mean, you just. Uhm, I mean, that, they had done all the nurturing they could. Now I am thinking about how my parents have been extremely gracious and have helped me move in, but they want to make sure that the growing process of becoming an adult and living on my own continues. I now realize that they have gone through the separation process of me leaving, and I think that needs to continue.
I'm trying to understand how my father, who is in his late 50s and well-established in his community and profession, might react to me moving back closer to home. I think he might be nervous at first, wondering what's wrong and why I'm moving back. Maybe he will be unsure how to interact with me and hesitant about the change.
I feel like my father is a little afraid and maybe expecting to be involved more in my life as before. But I want him to understand that I'm independent now, I make my own living and I'm on my own. However, maybe I should improve our relationship and share more with him, not just focusing on me. What should I do?
Recently, I have been reacting in a certain way both verbally and non-verbally. I have been reflecting on how I came across, and it was mentioned that my mother was a good role model. She knew how to stand up for herself while being warm and giving.
I feel good right now. It's like my back is straight, my chest is high, and I feel really confident that I can do it.
I've been away at school and then working in another part of the country for a while. I moved back home recently, and I have been facing some problems since then. I needed some practice to overcome those issues, and I think I have managed to become assertive, sure of myself, and in control.
I feel like I should do something, but I don't know what to do. I am talking about sexual harassment with a man, and I want to make sure that I'm okay.
I work with a team, including my boss. We work directly together, though there are other people in the team as well.
I'm not sure where to go with him. Should I continue to wear pants to work or dare to wear a skirt again? Is the conversation going to focus on me again?
A couple of weeks ago, I was at the elevator in my shorts, waiting to go for a run when my boss walked by. He noticed my attire and commented on my legs, saying they were long, strong, and lean and that he wished his girlfriend had legs like mine. I felt self-conscious and quickly apologized for my attire. He said I looked great and continued to talk about it, even though a male client was present. I felt uncomfortable with the situation.
I felt very apologetic when my colleague made me feel small and it took my professionalism away. I didn't comment on how he looked in the suit. This made me feel like I wasn't going to be effective at work. I am angry because I haven't said anything about the situation yet, and I decided not to take legal action, but I feel like he shouldn't be saying those things to me.
I'm struggling with maintaining eye contact and my body language, like how I hold myself, when I'm feeling self-conscious. I tend to pull my skirt down when I feel this way, and I'm not sure if my hands are relaxed or not.
I am struggling with nonverbal communication and I want to improve it.
I'm bringing you some work to show you that I've done some work for you, and you have to take a look at it. And, I'm just talking to you and I'm showing you things and I'm looking at you. My hands are not down at my body here but maybe down at my side or maybe they're just a little stronger looking, not touching my clothing or around it and conscious of what I'm wearing or how I'm looking.
I had a flashback to a situation with a client, who kept commenting on my legs and even brought his girlfriend. The whole experience made me feel uncomfortable, and I found myself unable to maintain eye contact with you during our discussion.
I watched myself and I noticed that I was unconsciously pulling my dress down and rubbing my hands on my legs as if I was trying to hide. It seems like I may struggle with assertiveness and making eye contact. When I look down, I feel like I come across as a little child, embarrassed.
I've been feeling better lately, like I've made some progress. However, sometimes I still feel like a little girl who isn't understood.
I think I would sort of maybe take a deep breath like I am now and calmly ask him to just work with me in the garden, not as a lesson but as two people planting flowers.
I want to improve the relationship between my father and myself. I think it's time for us to have a mature relationship as two adults, although I will always be his daughter.
I want to talk about an incident that happened a couple of days ago. We were talking, and I was about to go for a run. While we were waiting for the elevators, you made a comment about how I looked. You got into detail about my legs, and I didn't think it was appropriate. I don't know if you feel the same way about this, but I find it uncomfortable.
I feel uncomfortable when a coworker comments on my physical appearance at work. I believe in keeping a professional environment and not focusing on how someone looks. I am wondering how to handle the situation when someone makes such comments.
I feel that when I talk to my father, he still treats me like a little girl and doesn't treat me as an adult. I understand that he might be unsure how to talk to me now that I'm a grown-up woman, but it makes me feel like I haven't grown up and it doesn't make me feel very adult.
I've been feeling like I've grown in some ways, but my father hasn't. He's in a powerful position, being the head of a small company, but I feel like our relationship has stayed the same and he's been trying to catch up with my growth.
I have been acting like a little girl lately and I don't want to respond like a child anymore. I've even moved back home, though I am hesitant about it.
I don't think he knows about my feelings for him. I think it's been a long time for him, like about 10 years. We were teenagers when we last met, but he hasn't been a part of my life since then. I wonder if he knows me well enough now or what to expect from me.
I've been struggling to talk to my coworker John about some work I've done for him. I'm planning on bringing him the work and asking for a few minutes of his time for a conversation. I'm worried he might not have time and I'm not sure how to start the conversation.
I'm feeling overwhelmed and I need to talk about something important with John, but he seems to be busy right now. Should I insist on discussing it now or try to find another suitable time for both of us?
I feel like when I leave home and mature, there's a point where I don't want to settle back in at home, which is unlike my Mediterranean background. When I do come back, my family is gracious and welcomes me with open arms, almost as if they want to make me a child again. However, when I found myself having to come closer to home, I experienced mixed feelings.
I remember spending time with my father in the garden. We used to enjoy doing this activity together, and I thought it was just a fun bonding experience. I think for him, it might have been a way to revisit our past when I was 16 and he would teach me things.
I have had enough with this stuff, you know, I'm not going to take it anymore. If somebody approaches me in the store, I'm going to confront them, challenge them, and say something to them. I expect they will deny it, but that's not going to stop me. If they do that, I will do something about it, like calling somebody else or complaining.
I realize that I can't confront everybody, and I understand that I can address the ones that I believe need to be addressed. I'm capable of handling important situations without getting stressed out. I've decided to organize a group of Latinos to address issues at a city-wide and state-wide level. We're working on developing a better understanding of differences and dispelling myths. I've had enough with the situation in the store, and I'm going to confront and challenge those who approach me.
I came to talk about something that happened this weekend, which has happened before, but has never left me so emotionally affected. I was at the store dressed casually and went early to avoid crowds. In the store, I noticed someone leaning to look at an item near me. This happened three times in a row, which made me feel uncomfortable and aggravated.
This weekend, I went to the store to avoid the crowds. I noticed I was almost the only person there, and when I was looking at an item on a shelf, someone else was suddenly looking at an item right next to mine. It kind of upset me. Then, in the next aisle, the same person was again looking at an item right next to mine. It made me feel uncomfortable.
I was shopping for my kids when I started feeling like I was being followed in the store. It seemed like a security person was watching me. It made me uncomfortable and I'm not sure how to handle this situation.
I have felt upset and frustrated recently because I am a professional and I don't think I should be looked at as someone who can take something from the store.
I have experienced a few incidents that have really bothered me. I remember helping a friend with his cleaning business, and his clients would never talk to me directly; they would talk to him and ask him to communicate with me. It bothered me a lot because I'm an educated person, but the clients treated me like I wouldn't understand.
I work with people and I think I relate well with them, you know, so I get through them, and so, ah, I think that those are strengths of mine, yeah. As a Latino and as a Chilean, eh, we have a strong family tie and, ah, we support one another, even from a distance, we still keep our relationships, so I have a good support group if you want to put it that way.
I get very angry when I see racism in stores, but it also makes me feel wired up because I don't think they're going to change anyway. I don't know what to do about it and sometimes I think maybe I've done something to cause people to follow me around.
You know, I realize that I can't confront everybody. I understand that I can look at the situation and address the ones that I believe need to be addressed, and let some others go by. When there's a situation that I really believe I should do something, I'm capable of doing it. There are important things that I don't need to get all wired up on. I'm really understanding that sometimes people do things that aren't necessarily intentionally bad.
As a patient, I struggle with knowing when to address difficult situations or when to let them go. One example is dealing with indirect discrimination at a store. I thought about talking to the manager directly to express my concerns, but I didn't. I have a strong support system in my family, but I still need help determining when it's appropriate to take action.
I feel like I have to stand up and speak up, not only for myself but for other people who don't have the voice to do so. If this is happening to me, I can't imagine what it may be like for someone with less education or resources, who wouldn't be as capable to address the issue as I may be.
I feel like there are different times where I'm reaching for the phone or seeking it out due to feeling frustrated with everything I'm supposed to do, and it is affecting my relationship with my boyfriend as he continues to do it.
I'm trying to work on spending less time playing Candy Crush and get more one-on-one meaningful time with my partner. He thinks it's more of a passion rather than an addiction, and he doesn't understand why I'm seeking help in therapy. I'm not sure how to include him in this process.
I feel really out of control sometimes, and it's causing me pain. I remember using something in class once, and my professor got really frustrated with me. It's been causing problems in my life.
Lately, I've been playing video games for about a half hour in the morning and maybe a half hour to an hour at night. Additionally, throughout the day, I play for one to two hours - usually in 15 to 20 minutes increments. I used to play for around 68 hours but have made progress in reducing my playing time.
I've significantly cut back on my screen time, and it feels bittersweet. It's good that I have reduced it, but I'm still spending four hours a day on screens and it feels like a lot of time that I could be doing other things.
I've been struggling with feeling guilty for the times when I do play and try to enjoy my free time. I end up cursing myself and feeling bad about it, which only makes me feel worse. I've been trying to practice mindfulness and set limits on my leisure time, but it's challenging.
I have been trying to change a habit that's difficult to break and that I'm attached to in a profound way. I've moved past the precontemplation and contemplation stages, and I've been taking steps to change by attending therapy sessions. However, I'm not sure if I'm making progress or relapsing and going back to the beginning.
I'm doing a little better. Uhm, we kept trying to do the mindfulness.
Lately, I've been practicing mindfulness to help with my anxiety and feeling of being overwhelmed. It helps me focus on wellness instead of just providing a temporary solution. I also started taking walks at work when I feel over-stimulated. However, I still struggle in class because I feel trapped and unable to do anything.
I've been trying to substitute some of my actions like using Candy Crush to cope with my anxiety and anger, with relaxation techniques. It helps a little, but if my phone is within reach, I'll still want to use it, and I can't relax the way I want to. So, I try to put my phone away or ask someone to hold it for me, but it's not always possible.
I haven't tried exercise yet to help with my anxiety. I'm just trying to calm my mind. I think exercise sounds good but I can't really do that on a bus.
I'm trying to practice mindfulness on the bus, so I put my phone away in my purse and backpack to make it harder to reach. This way, I can remind myself to be mindful, even though it may seem tedious or detail-oriented.
I've noticed that my partner and I spend a lot of time on our phones playing games, even during times when we're supposed to be connecting with each other. It's like we're not really engaged in each other's presence, and it feels like there's no real connection between us anymore. It started as something fun we did together, but now it seems like we're lost in our own worlds.
I've been playing this game with my friend for a while now and it feels like a competition between us. He's always ahead of me, and we discuss our levels when we meet. Even at family gatherings, we help others advance in the game on their devices. I sometimes feel I can't compete with him as he's too good at it.
I have tried to stop my behavior before coming into counseling, but I haven't been very successful in cutting back.
I just feel like I always have my hand on my phone and I'm constantly checking Candy Crush, waiting for my lives to recharge. I feel like I'm too attached to it, and I want to get away from this habit because it doesn't seem healthy. This has been going on since Christmas.
I started playing Candy Crush a few months ago during the holidays, when I had more free time as a student. My boyfriend introduced me to the game, and ever since then, I've been really attached to my phone. I hate it. I grab my phone every morning as the first thing I do.
I find myself playing a game on my phone as soon as I wake up, just like drinking coffee in the morning. I'll play before school or work and throughout the day whenever I feel like I need a break or when I'm idle, like on the bus. Depending on how well I'm doing in the game, I may get more excited to keep going or feel frustrated and put it away. But then I'll think about strategies or ask my boyfriend for help, as he is good at the game.
I've been struggling with my Candy Crush addiction and it's affecting my relationship. I want to limit my playtime to just the mornings, before bed, and after a certain time at night so that it doesn't impact my connection with my boyfriend.
I've been playing games more often than before, and my counselor asked me to keep track of how often I play and how I feel when I do it. He told me not to change my gaming behavior, just to write it down for a week. He mentioned that in our next session, we might discuss other addictive qualities, questions about alcohol and other substances, family addiction history, and social support.
I tried to leave my phone in places like at home or in the car, but I get anxious that I'm going to miss something like a new email or phone call or a text message. I want to be near my phone, but it's not working for me.
Lately, my boyfriend and I have both been struggling with phone addiction. We've tried various solutions like using an old phone, but it hasn't helped much. Because of this, our communication has been suffering, and I've even missed my bus stop multiple times due to being engrossed in my phone.
Lately, I've been losing track of time and control over my schedule when I get absorbed in my hobbies or distractions, and it's causing me stress. I'm balancing a busy life with a full-time job and attending school full-time, and sometimes I just need a break.
I've been pursuing things for the rush and the goal, and it was fun in the beginning. But now, it feels more and more like a trap and I'm just trying to get back to normal.
I've been struggling with the need to be productive all the time and I'm trying to give myself permission not to be productive and spend time on things I enjoy. However, I want to make sure I feel comfortable with how I'm spending my time and not feel guilty or embarrassed about it.
I have been using Candy Crush as a way to spend time when I was bored, and it felt productive at first as I advanced through the levels. But, I don't think I would have engaged in using a stress ball or being mindful to manage my stress.
I recently realized how much anxiety was part of my life as I started writing it down. Also, I find myself spending money on buying new lives in a game – like a dollar per life, and I do it about 25 to 20 times a week, depending on the time I spend on Candy Crush.
I've been spending over 25 dollars a week on extra lives for a game because sometimes I only have a few moves left and just a couple of jellies to clear. I feel like paying for more lives is worth it to help me progress in the game.
I've been trying to avoid spending money on Candy Crush, but the marketing is really tempting. I don't have a lot of money and I believe in spending it wisely on tangible things. Lately, I've been using mindfulness and meditation to deal with my anxiety and overwhelm instead of turning to the game. However, I still sometimes feel frustrated and get drawn back into it.
I feel like I'm losing time with my partner because they're always attached to their device, and I can't get that time back. It's frustrating, but they are attentive in other areas of our life. I think it's just the Candy Crush game that is causing the problem.
As a patient, I feel anxious when it comes to managing time. I'm always trying to multitask, like working while going to school, because I'm afraid of graduating without experience. Travel time also feels like a waste of time for me, so I try to fill that void with playing Candy Crush, even though I know it's not productive.
I am really stressed about managing my time and being productive, especially with the demands of graduate school and work.
Sometimes when I'm in a public place like a restaurant or bar with my boyfriend, I feel like people are looking at me and I have to occupy myself to not feel anxious about it. I don't feel comfortable being in my own zone and sometimes I wish my boyfriend would pay more attention to me.
I've tried to express to my partner how his behavior is affecting me, but I'm not sure if he understands that it's causing me pain. He seems to think that because he has control over his life, I should have the same amount of control. But to me, it's not just a fun game; it's become more than that, and I regret the time I could have spent with family.
I've been doing a lot of writing lately, and it has made me more aware of how often I play Candy Crush when I feel overwhelmed. I use the game as an escape from my life, but then I become overwhelmed by the game itself and need to put it down. When this happens, going back to my normal life feels like a break from the game.
I've been really struggling with the addiction to playing Candy Crush, and it has gotten so bad lately. It used to be a way for me to zone out and take a break, but now, the game itself has become a source of stress because some levels are so hard, and waiting for lives to recharge or paying for more lives can get expensive. So, I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life while waiting for my lives to recharge or for someone to give me a life.
I'm okay with multitasking, like drinking coffee and playing Candy Crush. I feel like I could finish my coffee quicker if I wasn't playing the game, but I do enjoy it. At night, I lie in bed and try to wind up my day. Eventually, I do fall asleep and it doesn't keep me awake.
Lately, I've been struggling with playing video games throughout the day when I should be focusing on work or school. I can't seem to control myself, and it's become problematic.
I just had a meeting with my counselor and they suggested that we meet again in about a month to check in and see how things are going. I agreed to the plan.
I am Jenny and I need to perform an exercise with two versions of myself, Jenny 1 and Jenny 2. I feel a bit confused, but I believe I can do it. Which one should I start with, Jenny 1 or Jenny 2?
I really want to change. I've gained all this weight, my hair is a mess, and I don't have any time for anything. There's no downside to losing weight; going to the gym may take some time, but what's the bad part about losing weight? Nothing. You look better, you feel better, there's no bad part to losing weight.
I understand that my inner voice is discouraging me from going to the gym because I might fail and feel bad about myself. But, I want to at least try and see if I can make a positive change in my life. My inner voice is sometimes rude and makes me feel worse about myself.
I stopped smoking a year ago and that's great, but now I go to grad school and I'm stressed all the time, so I'm overeating due to stress. I don't have time to go to the gym, so I've gained weight, and I don't have time for self-care. It's just extremely frustrating.
I feel like making a change is a lot of extra work and it's a bit overwhelming. I do want to change, but there's a part of me that's unsure about it.
I watched a demonstration of a therapeutic technique at school and I'm open to giving it a try. I'm supposed to sit in one chair and vocalize my desire to change, then switch to another chair and speak from the perspective of the part of me that doesn't want to change.
I feel like there's something dragging me backwards, and I'm not sure what it is.
I want to do what's best for me and I don't know why you're so against bettering ourselves. I mean, maybe… Are you scared of change? Because, I mean, change is scary but it can be for the better. And I don't see the harm in trying.
My mom has always had a negative impact on me. Ever since I was little, she would tell me that I'd fail at things, even before I tried them. Going to grad school was a big shock to her because she never expected me to make it this far. On the contrary, my third-grade teacher, Mrs. David, has been very supportive. She believed in me and even helped me pay for school when my mom refused to do so.
I felt weird but also kind of empowering when I popped in and out of those chairs during our activity. It allowed me to yell at the negative part of myself.
I've tried to be more open with my parents, but it's difficult because they're not very open-minded. They haven't been accepting of people I've dated, and they don't seem to let me make my own decisions or mistakes. I'm not a bad kid, and I don't think they understand that there could always be worse situations.
I'd say I'm at an eight because I have weekends that I usually don't work. I do work on Saturday nights for about four hours, but I have the rest of the weekend to myself. That's most of Saturday and all of Sunday. However, that's all the time I get, and I go to church.
I feel like I don't have enough time for myself, and I've been working too much. Sunday is usually a family day, but I need some time for self-care.
As a patient, I feel that going to school is necessary for me, and I can't eliminate that. However, work is something I could cut back on to improve my situation.
I feel like my reserved nature is making my life more difficult and complicated. I don't talk much in class and don't come up with things because I don't want to deal with any problems or issues that may arise from it.
I feel so pressured in school, and it's becoming unbearable. I feel trapped, like I can't make the changes I want in my life. However, I think school getting out for the summer could help a little bit.
I didn't notice it at first, but now that I am becoming aware of my behavior, I'm thinking maybe I should change it.
I'm feeling really overwhelmed with trying to apply to colleges, manage finances, and work my job all at the same time. It's just really hard for me.
I feel like being able to do my own thing and being more of an individual would be great. But it's hard with the current financial situation and schoolwork consuming so much time.
I am worried that even if things went well in my life, it wouldn't really prepare me for college or anything. I wish my parents would let me make my own decisions, be an individual, and money would just fall from the sky.
I am a 17-year-old junior in high school, and I am living with my mom, dad, and brother at home. My brother is older than me and has moved out of the house, so I am the only child living at home.
Lately, I've been really stressed out due to some alarming situations and decisions that I have to make, but my parents won't let me make them myself. It's been really hard and pressuring. I'm trying to understand their perspective, but it's difficult to make decisions on my own. College is coming up and choosing which one to go to is just so difficult.
I'm feeling overwhelmed, especially with schoolwork, and my parents don't seem to understand me. They say it's just my age and that I'll grow out of it, but right now, it's really hard.
I am having trouble making my own decisions, especially when it comes to dating and setting my curfews. My parents always want me to be with the right person, which often feels inconvenient to me. I have early curfews, and it's hard to go out and have fun. I just want to make my own decisions and have more time to myself.
I feel like I don't have any time for myself because I'm always at school or work. I'm not a routine person, but I can't seem to get away from it. I never have time to be alone and I don't even have privacy in my house. I can't even talk on the phone without someone hearing me.
Lately, I feel like I have no privacy and I'm constantly busy, which makes it hard for me to relax. I've also noticed that I haven't been talking as much, participating in class, or hanging out with my friends because I don't have time for fun anymore.
I feel stressed because of my parent's expectations about college, and it's affecting my happiness and social life. They said they would help pay for it, but I'm not sure if they will cover all the costs, so I have to work on that as well.
I really want to go and do things, but I'm not sure how to proceed, and I feel hesitant.
I feel like my parents are really strict and they always have to know what's going on in my life. They don't seem to understand that I have my own freedom and it could be worse.
I am having issues with my privacy, and people are just not getting it. I think maybe if I didn't work as much and had more time to myself, I could do more of my own thing.
I feel really overwhelmed with work and I don't have enough time for myself. Maybe if I worked less, I would have more time to make my own decisions, instead of dealing with everything as soon as I get home. But right now, that's not an option for me.
I am struggling with managing work and other responsibilities at the moment. I think it might be better for me to work less, but that doesn't seem to be a reasonable solution right now. Maybe summer would be a better time as there'll be no school then.
Lately, I've been struggling with finding balance in my life between work and school. I'm thinking about working less for now, but eventually finding a more long-term solution. For now, I just want to try opening up and focusing more on school, but I could try harder.
I've been feeling a lot of pressure lately, and I plan to talk more with my friends and do more work at school to see if it helps.
As a patient, my main concern is how to manage my time so that I can stay on top of my homework and reduce my stress levels. I am thinking about staying at school to finish my homework or really focusing on getting it done while I'm there.
I am feeling an overwhelming sense of stress and I always buttheads with my parents. I wish I could make some of my own decisions and manage my time for myself a little better. One thing I think might be helpful is being more open with my friends, as I feel reserved. Additionally, I am considering reducing my workload to have more time for myself and complete my homework at school.
I think I can try to be more open about my feelings. It's tough for me to notice when I need to talk to someone, but I'm willing to work on it, reduce my work by an hour a week, and do more homework at school. I'd say I'm 50% committed to working on these three things.
I don't have much time for myself and not enough privacy, which is really starting to bother me. I think having my own place would be great, but I'm still in high school and I don't know if I could go to school, work, and pay for everything.
I feel like I'm on a six or seven on a scale of one to ten, because my parents control my free time and they don't like some people that I want to be friends with. It's hard to tell someone I can't be with them because my parents don't like them, and it makes me feel like I'm not old enough to make my own decisions.
I don't know, sometimes I just reserve myself and don't talk much because I worry about being asked questions or getting involved in situations where I have to share my opinions or make decisions. It's getting difficult for me, especially in situations like getting a piercing, because my parents have strong opinions about it.
I don't really see my situation as closing in on me. It's my problem and I'll deal with it. My mom doesn't want to help me, so I'm doing it my way. But when I received the court summons and my mom suggested I should try to work through the legal process, I hit rock bottom and decided to give it a try.
I've recently faced some legal trouble which has led to my mom becoming more pushy and restrictive. This situation has made me doubt myself, and now I'm involved in this program, meetings, school, and the juvenile justice system. It all feels like too much.
I didn't really want to come here today since I have been through all this kind of stuff before.
I don't wanna do this again. Why should I try? It's been too much for me. It just happened. I just didn't get them. My mom gets too tired of me. Everything got worse, right. Then this again.
I got suspended from school for doing drugs and realized I should try to accept that I need help. However, I've been through a lot and feel like I could probably handle more on my own.
I've been hanging out with my friends and doing what I want to do, but my mom isn't happy with me at all. She has become really strict and doesn't want me to go out with my friends since I got arrested. I don't think it's a big deal anymore.
My best friend, who I used to hang out and smoke with, got arrested and now it's been tough for me. Not only is he not there, but I have to either smoke alone or try to socialize with people on weekends to find someone to get high with.
I don't want to get in trouble again with my best friend, who will be back in a month. We used to get high every day, and my mom has been on my back about it.
I've been feeling stressed lately, especially since it's become difficult for me to stay with a friend I grew up with. My parents, who used to give me freedom, are now pushing me to not be free and my mom is constantly on my back.
I'm feeling overwhelmed with my personal and legal issues, and my relationship with my mom is also strained. I'm open to the idea of getting help, but I'm not sure how to start.
I don't want to come to counseling, but I did come this time. I agree with some of what you're saying, but I'm not sure about forming a team. I already hit rock bottom.
I recently met with a counsellor, and we decided to give therapy a go. It was a nice meeting, and I felt comfortable with them.
I've made some progress in managing my business, but I still have issues with drug use and smoking. The situation at home is not stable, and it's affecting both my mother and me.
I have been going to three meetings and it has been a hassle for me. I'm not sure why I am coming here.
I've been struggling with using drugs every day, but I found an alternative way to cope by writing my thoughts and feelings down instead of getting high. However, I still find myself using sometimes.
I am a mother who loves her daughter dearly. She's a very strong and determined child. I am taking the resources and risks involved in getting counseling for her and myself.
I never thought I would need counseling, but I'm struggling with my 5-year-old daughter, Emily. She has unbelievable tantrums that last for hours, and it feels like she is possessed. I feel completely helpless and at the end of my rope.
I am having a really hard time right now. I'm a single mom working two jobs and I have a kid to take care of. I feel very overwhelmed and I'm not sure if I can handle counseling on top of everything else.
I have been talking to my parents and to you, the counsellor. I am looking for some youth online and will continue working on this issue.
I haven't shared my situation with anyone in the school other than you, and I am scared for my life. My whole life I have been called every name in the book.
I've been feeling down recently because people have been calling me weird due to my interests and how I dress and act. I enjoy guy sports like baseball and football, and I prefer hanging out with the guys. It's just who I am.
I'm just sick of listening to these things and the jokes that people tell all day. I'm afraid that I might get beaten up or attacked, and some of that has already occurred just by what they see on the outside.
I don't have any close friends at school, but there are a couple of people I feel comfortable working with. They don't really know who I am, but they seem to accept me, at least by the way I dress.
I've been struggling with my gender identity and I've reached a breaking point. I can't stand living in this body that I hate any longer. As a senior, I want to make the full transition before I go off to college.
I saw a movie called 'Boys Don't Cry' and I felt like the main character is me. It was really powerful and now I'm scared to death about making this transition.
I've been really fortunate to have supportive people in my life, but I'm about to go out into the world and start life in school. I'm feeling a mix of emotions.
I have been thinking a lot and it is so important for me to undergo gender change operation before college. I can't take it anymore and I really need to do this, even if it is during the school time.
I found out who I am and I am very proud and excited about it, but I am scared to death to share it with the world, especially with my peers and teachers if they found out.
I know what feels right, and I think I know where I should be as a person and what I should look like. I want to get there.
I am scared after having seen the movie 'Boys Don't Cry.' The movie is about a transgendered young person who ultimately ends up being killed.
I'm feeling really tentative about a certain topic right now, and I'm not sure if I want to talk about it.
I haven't gotten into any chat rooms or talked with any other transgendered youth at this point. The idea makes me a little nervous, but I know I should probably give it a shot, as it might be the safest way for me to communicate with other people.
I feel really isolated and alone, and everything just seems so overwhelming. I'm really confused and frustrated right now.
I am really feeling lost and don't have anyone to talk to about this. I appreciate you listening, but I just don't know what we're going to do.
I feel like if I can just skip to college, I can be just a guy, and no one knows what I was before. However, I'm a little over a year away from starting college and I'd like to do this during my senior year.
As a patient, I don't know how safe it is to talk to the administrators. I'm not so much nervous about the teachers, but it's my classmates that I'm worried about.
I am terrified about coming out to my peers at school, although I feel like the teachers might be more accepting. My parents are supportive, and I think they would be okay with informing the school personnel for additional support.
I think I feel this way a lot, like I want to express myself, but I'm always discouraged. I do want to take a risk and talk to someone I trust, like telling them I've been feeling really sad lately, but it seems kind of scary.
I am scared and feel fear of rejection from my friends. I feel like I have to watch every word I say and cannot openly talk to my parents or friends.
I wish my parents would just like me, and I wouldn't have to be constantly on guard. I just want to ask them to like me.
I feel ashamed of myself. I wish I could be different and be what others want me to be. I don't know anybody that says anything positive about being gay. I just wish I wasn't so angry and that I didn't feel like this.
I don't even want to be at school. I leave most days right after third period and I don't come back. I just maybe go to the mall or go home. I just don't have to deal with anybody and I just feel like I don't have to answer anyone. I can just sit and shut all the voices off and kind of be by myself.
I just feel like I wish I wasn't gay so I can have friends and be accepted. I want people to like me, but I don't feel like I can talk to people right now. My family and friends make homophobic remarks, and when I'm at home and my parents talk about gays being repulsive, I feel angry, frustrated, and really hot.
I feel really scared, and my heart races. I get so frustrated and angry that I just want to scream or break something.
As a patient, I am willing to join a support group, but I am concerned that people might know that the counsellor is in my classroom to see me.
I hadn't really thought that my friends were bullies, but it would be nice to have someone to talk to about it. I think everything went fine and I feel a little bit better.
As a patient, I'm struggling with being gay, and it's hard because the only other gay people I know at school are white. They can't understand what I go through as an African-American.
I have been facing bullying because of my sexual orientation. I feel sad and angry about the situation but I want to do something about it. However, I feel anxious because I don't want people to know that I'm gay, and I'm unsure about how they will react.
Lately, I've been feeling unhappy, tired, and not good about myself. I'm not sleeping well and haven't been going to school much. I think this started about three months ago, and I feel like I don't have many friends and lack connection with people at school.
I've been feeling sad and having trouble sleeping. I keep waking up during the night. My energy level has been really low, and I feel very tired and exhausted, not wanting to stay at school too long. I also feel separated from everyone and wish I had more friends. I just want to feel normal and accepted.
I guess in the past people have made remarks, um, just remarks about me being gay. Or assumptions about me being gay.
I'm worried about taking antidepressant medication for my depression. Are there any risks or side-effects involved?
Lately, I have been feeling really tired, frustrated, and down. I haven't been feeling happy, and I just feel emotionally exhausted and not uplifted.
I haven't been feeling that I have the power in me to lift my own spirits lately.
I have been experiencing various symptoms over the last three months and because of what's been happening at school, I've been feeling quite depressed. I don't drink alcohol, take drugs, or have any medical problems that require medications. I only take vitamins.
I'm experiencing symptoms like feeling bad about myself, difficulty sleeping, and trouble concentrating. Are these related to low levels of certain brain chemicals and is that what's causing my depression?
I am feeling alone and unwanted. People are making fun of me, and I don't feel supported by those in my life. On a scale from 1 to 100, my sadness level is around 90.
I don't want to hurt myself. I just want to be different. I want to be liked by my friends and stop feeling like crap all the time. I wish I wouldn't be gay so I could be like my heterosexual friends and be liked.
I don't want to feel like I'm different or not liked. I feel like I don't have a place. If I weren't gay, my life would be different, and I would have friends. But I don't know that I could change.
I don't know if I believe that my family loves me. I feel alone and isolated, and it's a heavy load that I'm carrying.
I guess, I'm just here to talk to somebody. Um, I don't really feel like I've had anybody to talk to and I've just been feeling really down lately. And I want to talk to somebody. Yeah, just um, I've been feeling really tired lately and I just haven't, I haven't been feeling good. I just feel like I don't really have any friends at school.
I feel isolated and like I don't have anyone to talk to or rely on. I've thought about trying to make new friends by joining clubs or activities but I just feel so tired and unmotivated.
As a patient, I feel like there is no place where I can be completely myself, including my ethnicity, sexual preference, and overall being. It's frustrating and overwhelming, but I'm glad to talk about it with you.
I'm struggling with achieving what I want in school and in life. I feel like there's something within me that needs to change, but I also think that I'm in a very heterosexist and possibly racist environment that isn't supporting me.
I have just been able to categorize what's going on in my life, instead of feeling overwhelmed and stuck. I want to move forward and feel there's no other way.
I had a good session with my counsellor today, and I'm looking forward to our next meeting.
As a patient, I find it difficult to talk about my feelings regarding my father's new family and his reluctance to discuss the past. I feel like I have to contain these emotions and it really upsets me, but I've never really discussed this with anyone before.
I somehow started to talk about my feelings today, verbalizing my anger and recklessness, and maybe the disappointment. But I'm still trying to contain it, even here. I'm not quite sure if I can fully go there yet.
I have been living a reckless lifestyle - going out, spending lots of money, drinking, and partying. However, I failed a year in my studies and feel angry at myself for not being better and doing better. I feel like I'm lacking in terms of my behavior and my studies.
I feel confused and it's quite painful. This confusion makes me feel wobbly and sad.
I feel alone and like I don't have anyone to care for me. I think not having my mom in the picture has a big impact on my life. My dad is in the picture, but he's busy and he's a man, so he cannot fully attend to my emotional needs. I struggle with this, and sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to look after myself.
My life seems pretty crazy right now. I've failed a year in university and all my friends have graduated, leaving me alone. I feel like my life is out of control, angry, and reckless. I think the divorce of my parents 10 years ago is also affecting me, and I haven't spoken to my mom since then. I find it hard to cope and it has affected my studies.
I left home two years ago to start university, and since then I've been living in London on my own. I'm feeling quite lonely and I don't feel like I have the skills to look after myself, even though I know deep down that I do.
I can build relationships easily, but I'm really scared of that person leaving me, which has wrecked relationships in my life. After I feel something for my partner, I can't get past the thought of them leaving me. I'm alone in London, but I don't want to be alone. I can form relationships with friends, but not as confidently as with close relationships.
I can develop very good friends, but I can feel quite insecure at times. I think that's more to do with when I feel genuinely insecure in my life and not really to do with that relationship. It's not just relationships, there's other areas of my life where I can start to feel insecure as well. But not all the time, I think you can get triggered and then, it kind of all goes bad. These triggers include stuff like rejection, but it's hard to say specifically.
I often feel like I'm not good enough to look after myself or be cared for by others. At times, I feel worthless, and that's when I start sinking into depression. This also leads to reckless behavior as a quick fix, but it doesn't actually make me feel better.
I've been engaging in reckless behavior to feel better temporarily, and this has been going on for quite a while. After failing university and realizing this counselling is free through the university, I know I need to sort things out. I want to be here and I think I need to face something that has been bothering me for years, but I'm not sure what it is. It might be related to my parents' divorce and my mother leaving my life.
I feel like I failed in my past relationship. I often question if I wasn't good enough for her. When I feel rejected, even slightly, by friends or boyfriends, I tend to get into a dark place and become irrational and unstable. I think I am very sensitive in my everyday life.
I've been feeling all alone because I don't think my friends will understand my problems as they've had good lives. It's embarrassing for me, and I wish someone would comfort me and tell me that I am a good person and everything will be okay.
I'm worried because I feel like others may not understand my pain and confusion, so I tend to keep it to myself. I go out drinking and act recklessly, pretending to be happy when I'm actually hurting inside. I'm afraid that if I show my true feelings, people might stop liking me.
I feel more hurt lately because my own mom left me and I never got an explanation. It's made me really angry and upset.
I think something triggers my feelings, but I am not sure what it is. It might be related to ending relationships or arguments. I feel retracted or pushed aside and somehow think it's my fault. I remember when I was a young girl, my mother left, and I felt like it was something I did wrong.
I never understood why my mother left when I was young, and my father never really explained it. I know that she had problems with alcohol and my dad wasn't nice to her. I'm worried about turning out like my mom, not being able to handle life.
Lately, I've been struggling with guilt, low self-esteem, and feelings of worthlessness, which in turn have been making me even more depressed.
I really want some positive feedback on things I'm doing well. I also want to be okay with feeling disappointed, as I understand that being disappointed is a natural part of receiving constructive criticism.
I want both positive feedback and constructive criticism, but I'm having trouble rephrasing this statement.
I feel calmer now because I am realizing that feeling disappointed is a natural reaction and it's okay to feel that way if I don't receive praise.
I've been feeling like there's something wrong with me and I have a lot on my plate right now. One significant stressor is a paper that was due last week. I haven't been able to complete it yet.
I actually got feedback from my advisor this weekend. It was a mix of both good and bad. She said that I did well for it being like a first draft, but there was a lot of feedback that was overwhelming to get, you know.
I'm sitting outside the building where my therapist's office is, where I usually sit before my classes. I see trees, a food truck, and some tables.
I'm sitting alone, and there are just a couple of people around me. I am currently running through what I want to say to someone and reminding myself that she has always been supportive when I've asked for feedback.
Recently, I'm feeling really anxious about asking my supervisor for feedback on my drafts as I fear that I might be annoying her and taking up too much of her time. This constant worry is making me feel nervous and stressed out.
I am sitting in my coach's office, and it's just me and her. I can see her clearly, and we are sitting across from each other.
I received feedback on my work, and it was all over the pages, making me feel like I didn't do good enough. I feel like I disappointed my teacher, and I would have liked to talk to her about it.
I sometimes fear feedback from my mentor, even though she has been receptive and able to clarify her intentions when I've been open with her. I still worry that I'm disappointing her and that I'm not good enough. I feel like I fill the narrative with thoughts of her believing my work isn't good enough.
I feel nervous about talking to my advisor for feedback, but I think it could be helpful to clarify things with her.
I've been feeling anxious about talking to my advisor regarding the feedback I just received. I'm not sure how to approach the conversation and it's making me feel nervous.
I am working on my master's thesis and I am under a lot of pressure to get excellent feedback from my adviser.
I have received feedback in graduate school that wasn't positive. It felt like they were ripping me to shreds, although that's probably not their intention. They said that my writing wasn't good and that I was being careless in editing, which made me feel really bad.
I feel like I must get praises for my paper, but meeting that standard all the time sounds terrible. I don't know if it's even possible.
I think it's not possible to get only praises for my Master's thesis because I need constructive feedback to improve. I've never written anything like this before, so it's not possible for it to be perfect.
I am struggling with the fact that it is challenging to receive praise for my work, even though I know it is difficult.
I have been feeling on and off throughout my time in this program, and I'm afraid that if I don't do well, it will validate that I'm not meant to be here. This program is really meaningful to me and the work that I want to do in the future.
I feel like if I'm not good enough for this paper, it means that I'm not meant to do what I really want to do. It almost validates that I'm not good enough for my chosen profession and not ready for the next steps.
I think it’s both in the sense that I really struggled with feeling like I’m good enough, but then there’s another part of me that I’ve worked so hard and I have all done well in the program. So there’s a part of me that knows that I’m good enough.
I probably wouldn't be here if I wasn't good enough for the program, but I still feel like I'm not doing well in some aspects.
I went out with my friends to a pizza place recently, and the food turned out to be disappointing. But, I tried to look at the bright side - I was there to spend time with my friends and try something new.
I have noticed that when things don't go well in school or with my paper, I tend to blame myself for not trying hard enough. But when it comes to more fun things, like trying a new restaurant with friends, I can accept that people have different tastes and that there's only so much control I can have.
I feel like the goal of trying new places is a way to spend time with my friends and do something different, but when it comes to academic goals, it feels different. My goal is to do well, but it seems more about the atmosphere and being with people.
I used to easily try new things, like trying a new pizza place without it affecting my mood, but recently, I've been finding it harder to do even simple tasks like that. I would read reviews and sometimes things wouldn't work out, but before I could easily let it go. Now, it just seems to affect me more.
I feel I have a lot of things going well in my life. I have supportive friends and family, and I enjoy exploring Southern California. I never imagined I would accomplish so much academically and I am proud of my hard work.
I enjoy going hiking, especially in more rural areas. I'm also a big foodie, so I love exploring new restaurants with my friends.
As a patient, I'd say that a lot of times my friends and I just start with what kind of food we want to try and then actually go for a restaurant that we've never been to.
I usually choose restaurants based on reviews, but sometimes I end up having not-so-good experiences since everyone's tastes are different. The last disappointing dining experience I had was a couple months ago.
I've been working on my Master's thesis, and I have a big draft due later this week. It's been causing me a lot of anxiety, and even just sitting down at my computer to start, I feel flooded with anxiety in my body. This week has been particularly difficult for me.
My body itself just feels like it’s almost on end, like it’s just so full of anxiety. And then I just get this rush of thoughts that my work is not going to be good enough or that my advisor will think ill of me if it’s not good enough. Every time I sit at my computer, these thoughts come up.
I have to finish my draft, but I can only handle working on it for a few minutes before I need a break. Then I struggle to go back to it because I feel like the paper might not be good enough, and I'm worried that if it's not good enough, then I'm not good enough.
I feel like I'm not good enough to complete the final paper for my Masters program. This paper seems like the culmination of everything I've done, and I haven't felt confident this whole time.
I want to work on this other assignment to get started and then transition into revising more of my thesis project. However, I'm not sure if I should work on the thesis project during this time.
I'm finding it hard to get started on my thesis, but I think it would be easier for me to start off with something else.
I feel a lot of pressure to finish my draft and other assignments, and it's causing me stress.
I get to explore a new coffee shop and it feels great.
I was hoping to have a good chunk of time to write tomorrow, but I'm not sure how to add happiness to it. I do enjoy learning and reading articles, but I'm not sure how to make writing more fun or joyful.
I find joy in theorizing how my readings fit into what I'm writing about, but sometimes I feel incredibly anxious about it.
I love trying new coffee shops and I usually study in them. I often go to restaurants with my friend, and I don't like to spend more than two hours in a coffee shop.
I like to sit and focus, but once I get going, it's a lot less anxious. There's this one coffee shop in downtown Fullerton that I'd like to try.
I am having trouble deciding what time I want to meet for our session tomorrow.
I have been practicing a method to deal with my fears and worries in certain situations, but I still feel very anxious, especially when the situation gets closer. My counselor asked me to pay attention to my feelings and thoughts as they happen and write them down. Should I continue this even if I feel too anxious?
I've been feeling really stressed and anxious lately because of my thesis, even though I've done well in the past, and received positive feedback. All these doubts and worries keep popping up, and it's becoming overwhelming.
I think sometimes, even if I get an A and receive good feedback, I still feel disappointed for some reason. I feel like I could have done better and there's always room for improvement.
I feel like there's a standard which is almost perfect that I have to meet most of the time. If I get something lower than an A, I think I should have done better.
I've been feeling like I should meet certain standards, and I feel like these rules have been with me for a long time. I have always been pretty hard on myself.
Ever since middle school, I have been trying to strive to be the best that I could be. But when I don't achieve near perfection, I feel disappointed and as if I failed myself. I want to have a life and not work all the time, but I go back and forth about whether I should try harder.
I feel like a part of me is good enough for this, but it's been a struggle to get where I am now. I often think I just faked it or got lucky. However, there's also a piece inside me that believes I deserve to be here and I've worked hard to get here.
I often feel overwhelmed and anxious when I sit down to write a paper, thinking that I'm not good enough. When these thoughts pop in, I sometimes feel physically flooded and try deep breathing to calm myself down. I also try to remind myself of my past academic record and that I deserve to be here.
I've submitted a paper and received good feedback on it, but I still feel like I could have done it better. I worked really hard on it, but I can't seem to shake off the feeling that it's not good enough.
I am struggling to believe that my paper is good but I also feel like I can make it better.
I’m feeling anxious about going to see someone, but I think it’s helpful to think of instances where they have shown me that my presence isn't an annoyance. I’m planning to go outside, walk towards them with my thoughts, and sit on the bench before taking out my reminder cards.
I felt so much fear of disappointment, especially about the possibility that my mentor wouldn't want to work with me anymore. It was a physical sensation in my chest. But after we visualized the situation, it feels a little less scary, and we discussed what her likely response to me would be.
I think as concrete as we can get is hopeful. So there was I think I can get kind of passive, it’s just like general affirmations almost. I think at least three, but I was thinking five might be ideal.
I tried the technique you suggested by writing down three to five note cards, each with one concrete incident. I think I'm ready to discuss them with my friend this week.
I feel like I have this constant pressure to be perfect in everything I do, even when it comes to simple things like ordering pizza. I often blame myself for not trying hard enough and that makes me anxious. I am trying to shift my goal from perfection to learning and focusing on spending time with friends.
I have a goal of learning how to write better, but I tend to focus too much on getting praises or being perfect, which overshadows the learning process and enjoyment. Is this a problem?
I initially didn't see that perspective for my situation, but now I can understand how it might be helpful in dealing with the stressful parts.
I am worried about my thesis which is due in a while. I have to submit different drafts and the next one is due in two weeks. We meet once a week and communicate a lot via email.
I've been feeling like I'm bothering my boss whenever I leave her office. I keep questioning if she is annoyed with me and I'm afraid that she might not want to work with me anymore.
I have been working with my colleague for two and a half years now, and she has always been trustworthy, authentic, and non-judgmental. She has never seemed annoyed with me, and whenever I felt bad about something, she was very validating. I try to remind myself of these positive things about her.
I find it easier to remind myself of positive things when I'm anxious or worried, depending on the intensity of my anxiety. I trust my advisor and sometimes find it helpful to write reminders on a note card and have them easily accessible.
I'm feeling worried that my therapist is annoyed with me because I think I'm taking too much of her time. I'm afraid she doesn't want to work with me anymore. I have some note cards in my backpack.
I'm struggling to accept the idea that it's okay to feel disappointed if I don't do well, because I feel like I failed myself as a graduate student.
I think I'm probably like a six or seven on the stress scale right now, but if we go back to the old way of thinking, like I have to do well or else I fail as a graduate student and shouldn't be in this program, then my stress level would be at an eight or nine.
I think, I can feel it in my body. I can feel the distress lowering when I change my language a bit.
As the patient, I feel disappointed and frustrated about a situation with my graduate school work. I received some feedback on a draft that made me feel like I let down my advisor, even though the feedback was constructive and helpful. I even had to shut my computer away for a day because I was so frustrated with myself.
I remember when I was young, I brought my report card home, and my dad was disappointed that I didn't get all A's. I just walked away and felt disappointed, but I didn't confront him or talk to him about it. It felt bad, and I only asked him about it years later. What happened the next time I brought my report back home?
I had got all A's in my exams, but I didn't bring home the A's to show my dad because I wanted to avoid disappointment. My mom was a lot easier in stuff like that.
I've always been taught by my mother to just do the best I can and she'll be proud of me. But now, I feel like I've disappointed my advisor and it's harder for me to talk to them about it than it was to talk to my mom.
I wanted to get feedback that my work was near perfect. It may sound ridiculous, but it would help me feel that I'm good enough and capable of writing well, even in the first draft.
I feel overwhelmed because of the amount of feedback I received on my draft. It wasn't necessarily what she said, but there were so many changes to make and sections to rewrite. It was like every page was filled from the top to the bottom with feedback.
I am feeling overwhelmed with the amount of feedback I receive on my work. In my ideal world, I would like to have very minimal feedback, almost nothing.
I have been working on a project, and I was expecting some minor feedback and realistic suggestions, like one-fourth of a page or less. But instead, I received feedback that my work needs to be completely rewritten.
I feel like I should be working all the time, and when I'm not, I feel the 'shoulds' weighing me down. When I don't meet my expectations, I feel shame and disappointment in myself.
I've always been hard on myself academically. My dad was tough too; I remember he was critical when I got five A's and a B, saying I could improve. Now, I can't help but feel that I'm never good enough and constantly need to be better.
I feel like there's something that sticks in my mind and I also feel like there's a lot of pressure on myself. But when I was in high school, I always strived to be better, and I want to do well, not feeling like I have to do well, and I'm trying to shift to that mindset.
I feel like I always need to do my best, but it seems like I'm pushing myself too hard and it's taking a toll on me.
I feel so much pressure to perform well in all aspects of my life, from work to personal relationships, and it's causing me anxiety. I want to do well, but it's hard to cope with this stress.
When I meet with her, she has a soft facial expression but it's hard to read. It seems like she has a good poker face, not showing a lot of expressions.
I can't really tell if my friend is annoyed with me, but I want to trust her and our relationship enough that she wouldn't be. I haven't seen her being annoyed with anything, as she's usually very calm and non-judgmental.
As a patient, I sometimes find people annoying when they're short with their language and don't seem empathetic to what I am saying. Additionally, they might lack patience. However, I'm not sure if a specific person has ever been annoyed with me.
I haven't felt that my friend is annoyed with me, but I am afraid to directly ask her if she's annoyed because it might be too much.
I feel like I might be annoying someone by talking to them, but I think they're a genuine person, so if they were to tell me that they're not annoyed, I would believe them at first.
Lately I've been feeling confused and unsure about things, especially when it comes to making decisions. It's like I can't seem to figure out the right choice, and it's like my thoughts are all jumbled up.
I have been feeling down lately when I think about a specific person. I believe my emotions are mostly anger and sadness, but I hadn't really identified them until now. I just knew I was feeling not-good.
I've been struggling with my emotions lately, and after talking to you, I think it's mainly anger and sadness. This is probably because of my father's recent passing.
I've been feeling mad a lot lately, especially after my father's death. I'm not sure how to cope with this anger and sadness. Could we focus on exploring and working through the anger I've been feeling?
I'm not exactly sure where, but I think I've been angry and mad a lot because my dad was never really a good dad. And, it just kind of makes me angry when I think about that.
I'm feeling like my dad is a real jerk and I feel like he could never really be trusted.
Lately, I've been feeling rotten and out of sort, and I've been having different thoughts about my relationship with my dad.
I am having trouble identifying my emotions lately. I think it might be helpful if I can understand specific emotions like anger, sadness, shame, and fear.
Since my father's death, I've experienced emotions like anger and frustration.
I'm afraid to share my feelings with you because I don't know what you might think of me. I'm scared you might perceive me as weak if I show you how sad I've been, and if I express my anger, you might think I'm weird or get freaked out.
I've been thinking a lot about my personal feelings and showing my true self. It's been tough, but I've managed to start talking about it.
I think I experience different feelings, like there are different parts of me, a harder side and a softer side. It's kind of like a Jekyll and Hyde situation, you know?
I often find myself feeling angry and sad when I think about my dad, who was not a good father. The anger is more evident, but the sadness is harder for me to identify. I guess maybe I miss him a little and that's why I get sad.
I think the reason I am feeling sad is because I miss him. When I talk about it, I can feel that I am both angry and sad.
I've been struggling with both anger and sadness since my dad passed away. The anger is related to him being a bad father, whereas the sadness comes from missing him. I don't like the feeling of anger, and that's what I've been more aware of lately.
I've been feeling more angry and mad recently, and it's becoming quite uncomfortable for me. I even thought about dropping out of psychotherapy because of these feelings.
I feel like I am a bit more vulnerable in some sense and I have to be more careful. That's where the watch out part comes from.
I feel like Iceman could learn a lot from Marshmallow. Iceman tends to get into trouble for being too forward and aggressive, whereas Marshmallow is quite mellow and relaxed. I think Iceman isn't really aware of when he's being too aggressive, though.
Lately, I've been feeling like I'm always in Iceman mode, and I'm not really aware of my softer, marshmallow side.
I feel like there are two parts of me - one side is more like a marshmallow, vulnerable and soft, while the other is more assertive and cautious, like an iceman. I think the marshmallow side needs something from the iceman side to be more out there and not so vulnerable, realizing that I can just go for things and still be okay.
I often feel like different parts of myself are working against each other, and I'm struggling to find resolution. I have this one part that seems to be a harder side, focusing on anger and tough emotions. I think exploring and identifying these parts could be helpful in my healing process.
I usually call myself the Iceman because I can be hard and cold. But I also have a softer side, which I compare to a marshmallow - it's easily burned or hurt.
I sometimes feel like two different people - the Iceman and the Marshmallow. The Iceman is strong and pushes through, while the Marshmallow side of me is squishy and vulnerable, like I might get squished.
Lately, I've been feeling more cautious and I tend to withdraw a bit when I experience this softer side of me. I'm not sure why I do this.
I'm still in high school, and it's hard for me to deal with the transition between adolescence to adulthood. People my age, like my friends, don't really understand what I'm going through with these problems.
I've been feeling different lately, and I can't relate to my friends anymore. I don't talk to them as much as I used to, and I feel like I'm losing a part of myself. My parents are trying to guide me based on their own mistakes, but I want to make my own decisions and mistakes. They seem really close-minded about some things, and I'm not sure how to reach them. I'm struggling and hurting because of this.
I often feel like I'm not good enough even though I know I am. I'm constantly fighting or butting heads about it because I'm not a bad kid. However, my parents are very strict and always think the worst of me. I don't know if they were like that when they were kids, but I'm not them.
As I get older, I face new experiences that my parents don't know about, and I'm trying to be open with them. However, they don't understand my perspective, and they think any new experience will only hurt me. It's always one-sided and they don't consider how it might benefit me or how I'm handling it.
Lately, I've been feeling more reserved and I've noticed changes in myself. I used to fight a lot, but now I'm trying to compromise with people, but they don't want to compromise. I'm trying to maintain my relationships, but I'm worried it might be getting worse.
I am feeling hurt because the people in my life continue to act in a way that if they keep this up for the rest of my life, I'm just gonna exclude them from a lot of things that they want to be included in.
As a patient, I've tried many times to have a calm conversation with my parents about finding a balance between their need for me to be safe and my desire for more freedom. However, my parents just end up being too open-minded, and we never reach an agreement.
I have tried talking to my parents, especially my dad, in a calm voice about my desire to be honest with them. But when I share things, my dad just gets mad and it escalates into a fight. My mom doesn't really care, she just wants things her way. I don't know what else to do because they don't seem to listen and just get mad at me or take something away.
I'm struggling with expressing my thoughts and feelings to my parents. I can't control the outcome and what they're going to say to me. I put a lot of pressure on myself, fearing that if they get mad at me, I'm not a good person and they make me feel bad and mad. They have a significant power over my feelings, but I still want them to be my parents.
I feel stuck in this transition where my parents have raised me but they haven't given me enough freedom to learn things for myself. I just go home, go to bed, and do it all over again the next day. I don't know what else to try or do because as a teenager, I need them to let go a bit and let me do my own thing. I'm scared because I don't know how to do anything once I'm out of the house.
I'm struggling with making decisions for myself, like dating someone or even getting an ear piercing. I'm worried about how my decisions could impact me negatively or positively later, and I don't want anything to ruin my relationship. We fight about things I do, and I just want to be able to make decisions for myself.
I feel like I have to do certain things to maintain my relationship with my parents, but it's a struggle to balance that with my need for independence. I'm worried that in trying to be myself, I might damage our relationship.
I feel like my parents are too strict and controlling, and they base their decisions for me on their past mistakes. I want to make my own decisions and learn from my mistakes because I'm getting older. It's difficult to live with them and I still have a year and a half left in their house as a junior. I don't know how much longer I can handle this without fighting with them.
I really don't like the fighting with my family, but sometimes it's necessary because we're not getting our points across to each other. Also, I feel like they're closed-minded. We're fighting more about stuff now and I try to be honest and open, but they just get mad. I feel like they don't understand and are not willing to compromise. Also, I'm working all the time, stressed out and I have no time for myself.
I want to talk about feeling really overwhelmed lately with different situations, new decisions I have to make because of my age, and my parents not allowing me to make these decisions. On top of that, I work a lot and don't have much time for myself, leading to me feeling really stressed out.
I don't have much time to talk with my friends because I don't have privacy in my house, since it's small and everyone can hear me. I've also noticed that I am becoming more reserved in school and I don't express my opinions as much as I used to because I feel overwhelmed.
As a patient, I am not sure whether the information I provided is accurate.
I've always wanted to get an ear piercing on the top of my ear, but my strict parents don't allow me to do even such small things. I feel like they've convinced me that I'm going down the wrong path and that I'm not a good person when I argue with them. I'm tired of arguing because they're close-minded about some things.
I'm struggling to accept the idea of staying in my current home for another year and a half because I feel like if I don't move out, things might not get better. I'm not doing this to get back at anyone, but I'm seriously considering moving out.
I have been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I used to be outspoken, laugh a lot, and get involved in conversations, but now I find myself avoiding my friends and their problems because I feel like it's just too much for me to handle. I've noticed this change in myself and it's really hard to deal with.
I am trying to maintain a positive attitude and stay out of my friends' drama. I'm constantly busy with work and school, and my weekends are the only time I have for myself. My parents always have a say in what I do and sometimes it's not what I want. I'm not a bad kid, I don't drink or do anything wrong.
I have been feeling overwhelmed lately and my counsellor suggested that I try journaling or another outlet as my homework between our sessions. I'm willing to give it a try.
I don't really have any privacy or time for myself, which makes it hard to remind myself that I'm not a bad person. I tried journaling at school and it helped, but there's too much to write down.
I sometimes feel like I'm always doing something wrong because my parents are often upset. I don't know how to make them happy without compromising my own needs. I just wish they would let me be in charge of my own decisions since I'm the one who should be responsible for my life.
I want to be able to make my own decisions, mistakes and be more responsible as I am getting older. However, I feel that my parents are not open-minded and they don't understand where I'm coming from, even though I try to understand their perspective.
I feel like my parents don't trust me to handle emotional pain. They always want to protect me from getting hurt, and I don't think they understand that I need to experience these things to learn and grow. I want them to let me handle my own emotional struggles.
I feel like I'm a good kid, but sometimes others make me feel like I'm not. I still stick to what I want to do and my decisions, but it's overwhelming and I'm not sure how to approach someone about it.
I have tried talking to my parents about certain things in the past, but it never worked. So I started hiding things from them because I think some parents are better off not knowing some things their kids do. I don't like this secrecy, and I wish I could have an open relationship with my parents like my friend who has a great relationship with their parents.
I really want to confront my parents about something, but I don't know how. I want to have a better relationship with them and I'm envious of those who have that.
I feel the need for personal space in my relationship because my family tends to be negative when I open up to them about things I've done. This negativity makes me feel like a bad person, so I've started distancing myself and not involving them in my decisions. I'm still fighting for what I believe is right, but their reactions make me question myself.
I work hard at school, but it's overwhelming because of my job. I try to stay out of conflicts, but I've had issues with my parents. Lately, I've become more reserved, and it's affecting my schoolwork.
I'm struggling with my family making decisions for me and trying to control my life. I'm a teenager but I still deserve to make my own choices, especially regarding college and my future. I'm constantly worried if their choices are the best for me, and it's causing a lot of pressure and hurt.
As the patient, I feel like relying on others doesn't really solve my problems or help me get through difficult times. I wish I could have better resolutions to my issues, but I can't control other people's actions.
I feel like people around me can be quite persuasive in convincing me to do things, even if I'm not sure I want to.
As a patient, I've been discussing how knowing multiple languages, like English and Español, can provide me with more opportunities. I also mentioned that as a video game designer, I might need math for calculating scores and points.
I am interested in video and film making, but I don't really see any science on it. The only possible connection I see is if I create a science movie.
As a patient, my favorite subjects are History, Science, and Math. I really enjoy easy Math facts. I have career dreams of becoming a video game creator, and I think I would need a master's degree to achieve that.
I recently learned about a master's degree in making video games, but I'm not sure if it's a real program.
I have completed six sessions of individual counseling with my therapist, and we've been working on my stress, anger management in the classroom, and study skills.
I've been doing well in school and I have some hopes and dreams for my career and college. My most important dreams for my career are to be a video game creator, a movie star, and a movie producer.
I want to be a video game producer, a movie producer, and a movie star. I think I'll have to study the history of games, learn about how movies are popular and practice acting to achieve my dreams.
I need to improve my literacy skills for writing scripts for movies. Although I am studying English, I am not particularly interested in other languages.
I want to become a video game maker, but I'm not sure what exactly I need to study after high school. I've heard about fine arts, graphic design, and drama as some of the options, but I'm still unsure. Additionally, I'm struggling with my current teacher and was wondering if my career aspirations could help with that.
Lately, I've been feeling like I need to put on a brave face in class and act like everything's under control. But I do get upset sometimes and would like someone to talk to about it, such as you, my friends, or my teacher. On a different note, I've also been enjoying a movie-making class I started attending after school on Thursdays.
I have been attending a movie-making class, and we made five movies that are mostly comedies, but I also like science and horror. I have a disc with all the movies we filmed, and I'm thinking about sharing it with the class or the whole school.
I'm feeling overwhelmed with everything at university, and I'm considering leaving just to escape it all. I came to counselling to get an outsider's opinion on what I should do.
I am struggling with the idea that I need a higher degree of order and certainty in order to be happy and perform well. I also feel pressured to be competent and successful in all things I attempt, possibly due to expectations from my family. Can you help me with these thoughts?
I feel like life should be entirely pleasant and enjoyable, and any frustration, discomfort, or pain is unbearable. I think I should be successful all the time in everything that I do.
I recently failed an exam, and it's thrown my life out of order. My family and I have high expectations for myself, but now I feel like I'm not good enough.
I am working full time and I am also a part-time student. I recently got engaged and live at home. There's so much stress in my life with everything happening at once, and to top it off, I failed a big exam. I feel like I can't do anything right, and I feel like a failure. I'm embarrassed and disappointed in myself, and I am considering leaving university.
I am working full time and doing part-time study. On top of that, my wedding is just a month away, and I've just got engaged. Work is really demanding, and I recently failed an exam. I feel overwhelmed and don't know what to do.
I've been under so much pressure lately with everything building up. I'm living at home with my parents and I feel the need to do everything right. Recently, I failed an exam and I feel like I've embarrassed and disappointed them. I was scared to tell them because I knew they'd be disappointed and embarrassed.
I've never failed anything before, and now that I've experienced failure, it's really hard for me to deal with. It's new for me, and I don't like it at all.
I am planning my wedding which is going well, but it's really stressful. Also, I'm struggling with my university subjects. I've never failed before and this is the first time I'm experiencing this.
I'm usually successful in handling multiple subjects, but this particular exam just threw me off balance and I failed it.
I feel successful most of the time because I passed all my exams, not just my subjects, and I have a great full-time job that I'm doing well in.
I have been feeling like I am not good enough, but I'm starting to realize that I have had some successes. I've passed my subjects in first and second year of college, and I even have a full-time job.
As the patient, I am considering disputing a belief I have and making a powerful statement, which may involve making a decision related to staying at university.
As a patient, I recently made a decision and it feels okay, but I'm not entirely sure about how it will affect me in the long run.
I've been feeling really down lately, and I think the main trigger for me at this moment is failing my recent exam. This has made me consider leaving university.
Recently, I've been struggling with feeling like I'm not good enough. It has been really bothering me and I'd like some advice on how to handle it.
I recently failed my exam and I've been thinking about leaving university. It's been constantly on my mind and I feel like I'm not good enough.
As a patient, I feel like I'm doing a whole lot of things really well despite having a demanding job. I'm keeping up with it and managing my tasks efficiently.
Recently, I've been feeling overwhelmed with work and things with my fiance. I mean, we're engaged and all, but it's just been quite challenging for me.
I feel like I should stay and try again. Everything doesn't have to be 100% all the time. I could re-sit the exam.
I am feeling better about myself and my capabilities now. I've realized that I am good enough, and I can give my university studies another try. I am planning to re-sit the exam, and I believe I will be fine.
I have been carrying around some negative beliefs about myself for many years, and I've started working on changing my thinking and beliefs. I feel like I've made some good progress today, but I know it's going to take more effort.
I thought the timeline was six months, but I might have misunderstood. I didn't have the report in front of me and wasn't allowed to see it.
I am going to work very hard and try my best to improve my behavior. I've had many minor encounters with the law, and I understand that I need to look at the relationship between my behavior and these issues. I want to change and be better.
I've been good at coming across as a compliant person, but I struggle with controlling my behavior in certain situations like at the bar. I'm aware that I have something hanging over me, but it's difficult to change my behavior right away.
I have been struggling with my behavior causing problems for me, particularly when going to the bar. I think I need to learn how to put constraints on this part of my life, and I'm hoping to explore this issue in our upcoming session.
Over the past three to four weeks, I have been struggling with some behavioral problems. It took me a while to admit that I need to address these issues. I feel like my power is slipping away and it's been difficult to stay on track.
In our last session, I said that I acknowledge some of my behavior is my fault, and I'm willing to confront that.
I was trying to create a role where I would use communication to get what I wanted out of the conversation, but I wasn't getting that. It was frustrating me a little bit, and I was trying to find a way to break through that. I think the theory of counseling would have worked more in my favor when she started using real open-ended questions. I found it harder to get to where I wanted to go, and it didn't create a free flow of information.
I feel like going to the bar gives me freedom because there are no real rules or limitations and I can be as wild as I want. However, my therapist is suggesting that I avoid going to the bar. This makes me feel like she's taking away my freedom.
I've been told that I shouldn't go to the bar, but I really want to, even though I understand the potential consequences. The judge has set certain constraints that I have to follow if I do decide to go.
I had been having fun with my friends, but sometimes things go too far and something happens. Nobody means any harm by it, but it happens. The last incident where someone brought out a gun changed everything for me.
Oh, I'm comfortable now that I'll know that you're gonna help me. And, you're gonna write a good report for me, and the judge is gonna look favorable on me, and I'm not gonna have to go to jail. Yes, I'm much more comfortable than I was when I came here. I admit it.
I was talking to Dr. Norma and I mentioned that I assumed that we're going to accomplish something during our counseling sessions. I remember she mentioned something about providing accomplishments and setting ground rules.
I've been working on managing my anger, and I'm happy with the progress I've made. However, I'm worried about maintaining this progress, especially after my court case. If things turn out well, I might be interested in further exploring anger management techniques.
I've been struggling with controlling my anger, and I've found that certain environments are not healthy for me. For instance, I realized that places like the swimming pool or jogging track are better for me because people are more focused on their activities, and there are less chances of getting into arguments or fights.
I've realized that maintaining my manhood is important to me. I used to think that making people afraid of me meant I had status, but now I'm thinking maybe I could gain respect in a different way, like through boxing. People will know I'm a boxer, and maybe that will bring me the respect I desire.
I’ve been seeing you once a week recently, and I feel like something might be changing with my anger. It doesn't seem to be as deep when I get angry, and I can kind of let go of it a little bit.
I don't understand my anger. My anger sometimes gets almost to the point of rage, but I haven't harmed anybody seriously.
I've been struggling with some issues related to my masculinity and I feel like giving up bar fights and brawls would be giving up a piece of my manhood. I've been considering joining a boxing gym to be around people who understand and respect each other. These people work hard and don't have time for nonsense, so it might be an environment where I can maintain my manhood without getting into trouble.
I went to the gym and spent a few weeks there. At first it was okay, but then I realized it wasn't the answer I was looking for. However, I discovered a pool at the gym, and now I swim two or three times a week. I enjoy it because it drains my energy while I'm doing it, and I feel relaxed when I rejuvenate.
I've been focusing more on physical fitness, like jogging and swimming. My wife came back, and we've been getting along better by taking it one day at a time and avoiding anger. This has been helping me feel better about myself.
As a patient, I am worried about losing my sense of manhood if I give up fighting in the streets. I have been in about eight to ten fights in the past three or four years, but I feel that giving up fighting will make me lose my peace.
I have been thinking about standing up for myself, but I only see it as a physical thing. I can't think of any other way to feel good about myself. I remember admiring someone I met in the military who got involved in karate; they found a less destructive way to feel good about their manhood. I believe it's possible for me to find a similar way but I'm not sure what that would be.
I've been thinking about taking up boxing as a way to release some pent-up energy and for exercise. I believe it could be a good outlet for me to let my emotions out. What do you think?
I am worried about the demands that might be placed on me during therapy, because I've never had a lot of demands placed on me for too long. I don't handle demands well at all.
I'm trying to be straightforward, as I want to complete the required six to eight months of therapy and avoid going to jail for two and a half years. I'm open to working out an arrangement to reach my goal.
As a patient, I am feeling unsure about the idea of helping myself when it comes to dealing with my problems. It sounds pretty strange to me.
I'm willing to explore my behavior. I feel like I'm just unlucky because I don't mean any harm to people, but I often end up in fights. When someone gets violent, I feel like I have to handle it, and I don't give them anything they didn't ask for. I think I'm just in the wrong place at the right time.
I've never had to deal with a counselor like you before. I don't think my record is that bad, and I've been a victim of circumstances. I don't take a lot of grief from people, and if they get in my face, I tell them to get away. I think that's a fair way of treating people.
I can recall an incident where I got angry with someone who I thought was trying to take advantage of me. I confronted him and expressed my feelings, which led to an argument.
Lately, I've been feeling upset when people take advantage of me or don't take 'no' for an answer. For example, when someone tries to sell me something and they persist even after I've said no, it provokes anger in me. However, I don't feel angry towards you as I believe you're on my side and helping me.
I was not trying to manipulate you. I was being honest with you.
I think my issues are related to my environment, and I've realized that I should avoid certain places like bars to prevent getting into trouble. I've made some changes in my behavior and taken responsibility for my actions.
As a patient, I just had a session with my counsellor Dr. Norma Gluckstern, and I am leaving her office now. I might need to see her again in the future.
I'm not in jail yet, but it's a possibility and I haven't really thought about the extent to which I allow other people to control my behavior. What should I do?
I've been trying to stand up for myself and what I believe in, but I get angry during the process. I feel like I have been very respectful of you since I started coming here.
Well, I've been this way for a long time and I have no idea how it happened. I don't like it right now. I'm here, and I'm gonna have to be here once a week for six months. I'm not happy about that, and I don't think it paid off for me.
I recently had a court case, and the judge suggested that I don't go to any more barrooms. I am not sure if he was joking or he was serious about it. I was forced into the situation, and I think the judge's hope is that I might change my behavior and avoid such situations in the future.
Whenever I go to the bar, my behavior changes and I usually find myself in trouble. Many people in the bar are somewhat like me too.
I was hoping that in the next phase of our sessions, I could establish more of a rapport with the patient where they would see me as an authority figure they can trust. In our initial interview, I mainly focused on asking questions and doing attended behavior, while trying to get the patient to attend without being distracted. I want to help them look at their behavior in a barroom.
As the patient, I found that sometimes the skills the counsellor used on me stopped me from going where I wanted to go with the conversation, and I had to pull back a little bit. I couldn't get what I wanted out of that. There was a specific point when I felt I couldn't move outside that box.
I have been feeling stressed out lately, and I'm not sure how to cope with it. I find myself constantly worrying about work and my personal life, sometimes to the point where I can't sleep. Can you help me?
I find it challenging to work with people who can manipulate conversation so well, giving answers but not really providing any useful information. It made me realize how difficult it must be for therapists to deal with such clients.
As a patient, I felt there was an implied threat during counselling that if I didn't participate, contribute, and be active for a certain time period, then I might end up back in jail. I believe the counsellor held her power and had the right to report my actions, and if she didn't, I might have taken advantage of her.
I don't think my anger is the reason for my violent reactions. If people respected me and treated me decently, I wouldn't react that way. I'm not that kind of person, and I don't want it to happen. People make mistakes and say the wrong things, and I don't let it go by. I'm here trying to cooperate and help myself, but you keep asking the same questions.
I feel like my behavior is not my fault, and I can't be responsible for other people if they provoke my anger. I don't go out of my way to look for trouble, but if others use bad judgment and make mistakes, I can't be responsible for that. Do I have to take crap from people in order not to go to jail?
I feel like my parents did everything to raise a regular person, but there is a lot that went on with me that probably was internal and not based on their upbringing.
As an adoptive parent, I feel like I'm lacking education about attachment, trauma, and understanding what my newly adopted child has been through. I want to be a good parent and raise my child well, but I don't know where to start.
I feel like my parents learned how to handle my situation late when I was around 16-17 years old, by which point I felt like my life was already going downhill. I also feel that if they knew about it earlier, things might have been different and easier for all of us.
I think my family has learned a lot from my experience, and I believe they might even love me more than they would have initially thought because of everything we've been through together.
I think my birth mom has never fully recovered from giving me up for adoption when she was 17. She's had other kids since, but I don't think it filled the void. I also believe it affected her ability to be the best mom she could have been.
I have been in a relationship with someone who has been through a lot. He has a kid from a previous relationship but doesn't have custody. I think he struggles with attachment and accepting love due to his past experiences. He seems disconnected and scared to hold on too tight.
Since my son was born, my partner and I have been more aware of our fights and how they affect our children. Thankfully, the frequency of our fights has decreased, which has helped create a calmer environment for both our son and daughter. We realized it's not fair for them to witness our arguments or to be scared.
I found that my focus on my children has really changed me and stabilized my reactions. After being adopted, I couldn't go through with the thought of giving up my kids for adoption. I chose to become a better woman because of what I've been through, even though my parents suggested considering adoption when I got pregnant.
I don't think I would be able to be seeing if I had given them up.
I am a young mom who has managed to be responsible and independent by having a job, my own apartment, and paying rent. People look up to me and say that I give young moms a good name. But when I feel hurt or scared, I find it hard to reassure myself and feel alone.
I sometimes try to comfort my inner child, especially during times of high stress. I try to reassure her that everything is okay, but I'm not sure if it's enough.
I feel like I need to protect the little one inside of me because she's so small and afraid of being alone. I have taken on being an adult and shocked people who thought I wouldn't be able to do it.
As a patient, I have recently realized that my children don't see certain parts of me, which makes me a little concerned.
I've had a difficult childhood, moving around a lot in my first few months of life. I don't remember it but I find it affecting me now that I'm older. I've gone through therapy and boarding schools that have told me about its impact. Now that I have my own kids, I've seen how much the environment affects them. For example, my daughter has trouble sleeping because of the changing environments she experienced when she was young.
I've had two kids with my ex-partner. Our relationship was high-strung and high-stress, especially during my pregnancies when the rate of domestic violence increased.
I can't believe that if someone told me this would happen while I was pregnant, I wouldn't have believed them. It just seems so crazy to me that a guy could do that to a girl when she's carrying his baby.
I still struggle when my partner leaves, and the kids are asleep. Although I try doing other activities, I still have these emotions and feel the impulse to chase after him. Now, instead of physically leaving, I call him numerous times, even if he doesn't pick up.
I have this overwhelming urge to constantly call someone, even if it makes me more anxious. I can't control this impulse and it's like I'm possessed. I cannot stop myself from putting my finger on the call button.
I'm feeling this intense feeling in my gut that I have to do something, but I'm not sure what the best thing to do in this situation is.
I am a mom now, and I have a boyfriend who I am so attached to. This attachment might be due to my adoption and attachment issues, and it's affecting my relationship with him. I try to keep my life stable for my kids, but there is always one little unstable piece in my life.
I feel like my relationship is very conflict-driven and toxic. Everything is a conflict, and it doesn't seem like just one problem that can be solved or one person's behavior. It's like we both get triggered whenever we look at each other.
I have difficulty hearing people, especially babies, cry. It brings up strong emotions in me and makes me feel very upset and scared, so I often try to comfort them or sleep with them to help myself feel better.
I was worried about my baby being crib trained because I didn't want her to feel scared or unattended. It was a hard choice for me and I had to put the TV on to drown out her cries. I've been taking care of both my little self and my kid.
I am struggling with handling a certain situation, but I believe that in time, taking care of my daughter will help me deal with the other situation.
I realized that my previous lifestyle might have been unhealthy for my family and me, so I decided to bring my children up in a stable, healthier environment. Now, I focus on maintaining normal routines like staying in one place, having set bedtimes, regular dinners, and ensuring everything feels more secure and balanced.
I try to make it normal for my kids because I don't want them to follow my path. I never want my daughter to be in the situation I'm in with a guy that doesn't even treat her right. I never want my son to be that kind of guy. I have to make their life different than mine.
I have a hard time letting my kids cry. It's difficult for me to leave them crying even for a while. I know some people say you need to let them cry a little bit, but I can't do that. We did crib training for my daughter with my mom's help, but now with my son, I don't have that option anymore. I just can't handle the idea of putting him in a crib and listening to him cry.
I feel lonely even when I am with my friends, and it's worse when I'm with other people or men. I just want to be with my boyfriend, and although being with him doesn't exactly make me happy, it feels like I'm less alone. I feel like I need to be near him, almost like an addiction.
I feel lonely, whether I'm with my partner or not. When I'm with him, I sometimes feel even more alone, and it makes me sad and scared. He does not like to see me emotional and gets angry in such situations. Our living arrangement often has him sleeping away from me and the kids, and I am not sure if he will stay or leave because he tends to leave when things get tough.
Recently, I feel like the person I care about has been distancing themselves from me, and I'm not sure why. It's making me feel insecure and I don't know how to handle it.
I struggle with being alone and tend to please or beg others to stay with me, doing anything just to keep us together.
I feel like my boyfriend does everything under the sun to make me leave him, but he never wants to end the relationship himself and neither do I. I think there might be an opportunity to heal if we both work on it together, but he needs to see that there's something to heal. Despite everything, I believe he loves me deeply and I'm not giving up on our relationship.
I am in a domestic violence relationship, and my partner says he loves me in a deeper way. I have a traumatic attachment history, and this makes me yearn for the feelings.
I had a long-term relationship that ended a day after a significant event in my life, and I was afraid of being alone. I had to focus on being a mom to my kids, because if it wasn't for them, I would probably go back into old behaviors of not wanting to live. I was very sad, but I managed to pull myself together for the sake of my children.
Even when he doesn't pick up for three days, I will have called him millions of times, it feels like and I don't even exaggerate. I mean, I will call him 24/7 like I will wake myself up at two in the morning to call his phone. But that's not his position in our relationship. He's never gonna be the one to call me a million times. I feel comfortable with him and I don't think I could feel the same with someone else.
As a patient, I want to discuss my relationship with my partner. We don't have a lot of money, and both of us have to work. I feel like I'm working just as hard as he is, and when we both come home, I don't want to do all the housework while he goes out with his friends. He's a good dad and loves the kids, but maybe he needs to grow up a bit.
I'm talking about my 25-year-old partner, who is a father now. I feel like his life is taking longer to change after becoming a parent than mine did, but the kids love him and he's much softer with them than he is with me. He sometimes gets emotional when he realizes he's made mistakes. I feel safe with him physically, but I'm concerned about how he treats me compared to our children.
I feel like my partner's violence is manageable at this point. We can both get very toxic, but we've come to the agreement that when space is needed, it's best to take a break and walk away. It has shown a lot of growth for me as I wasn't able to do that before.
I always feel like my daughter saved my life. She's two now and very in tune with my emotions. When I cry, she cries too. She hasn't seen anything terrible, but sometimes my boyfriend and I fight at night when she's asleep, and I think it affects her sleep pattern. The fights are usually verbal and not in front of the kids, but I'm worried about the impact on my children, especially my daughter.
I have experienced parental fighting, especially at night. It was very scary as a kid. I don't think I understood exactly what was going on, but the loud noises and yelling would frighten me, even when I was in a deep sleep.
I think my family loves me more after going through all this, and I taught them things they didn't know before. I didn't know why I had these feelings and impulses before, but I feel like I understand a lot more now after experiencing everything I've been through.
I have become more educated about my attachment issues but I still struggle in recognizing when to leave a situation. I want a stable, consistent living environment for my children and me where we can have a routine and know what to expect day by day.
I'm a young parent and I feel like my daughter has trouble sleeping because she was constantly moving around when she was young. I was 18 when I got pregnant, and I had to learn to raise a baby while taking care of myself. My son, on the other hand, had a more stable environment growing up.
I have observed that my partner has a strange relationship with his mother. He loves her, but he also pushes her away and doesn't seem to be kind to her. He often misses her birthdays and Mother's Day, even though he says she's important to him. His adoptive parents divorced when he was four, and I'm not sure if that has an effect on his behavior towards his mom.
I feel this tremendous bond with him, but I also have mixed feelings. I can't imagine my life without him, but at the same time, I couldn't see myself being with somebody else if that makes sense.
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say, I was like, I didn't say that right. I mean, I don't know if I could spend the next 80, 70, 80 years. Like when I
Lately, I've been experiencing the domino effect where one bad thing happens, and then everything sucks. I remember mentioning this last week too. I know about optimists and pessimists, like the glass half full or half empty concept.
I'm struggling to understand the concept of outlook and how it affects my life. I'm not sure if I'm an optimist or a pessimist.
Lately, I've been feeling down and pessimistic about everything. Whenever something bad happens, I blame myself, think it's going to keep happening, and that everything else in my life, like my relationships and hobbies, sucks as well.
I don't know. I guess when I get-- when I start getting angry it's everything, I guess.
I feel like my teacher is always looking at me as if I'm doing something wrong. She seems to be out to get me, even though others are doing the same things I'm doing. It's like I'm being singled out, and I recently got in trouble for talking when others were doing the same.
I feel like someone has a grudge against me, and I don't think they like me at all. To make matters worse, I lost the football game last night.
I'm feeling really down about not catching that third pass in last night's game. If I had caught it, we could have won easily. I did catch a few other passes, but they didn't really change the game.
I feel like my friends are giving me a hard time because I wasn't playing along with them. Today, I went to school feeling down and ended up in a discussion with one of my teachers. This is not the first time it has happened, as I remember a similar situation occurring last week.
Lately, I find myself focusing on everything bad that happens and feeling overwhelmed. But, when I think about it, there are some good things happening too. I can name three positive things, but I'm not sure how to keep these good things in mind every day.
I agreed to try a suggestion by the counsellor, which is to put one of the items in my iPhone and the other in my pocket. I confirmed that I'm willing to try it, and she asked if she could check with me later in the hallway to see if I followed the plan.
When something bad happens, I tend to spill it into everything else, making it seem like everything else bad is happening. Right now, I am making better grades than before because I've been focusing more, but I still feel like everything I do wrong contributes to things going downhill.
I think I'm making better grades because I'm focusing more. Also, even though I lost last night, I guess I'm doing okay in the football season because I've been practicing more.
Lately, I have been practicing more and even spending time practicing on my own with some of the guys. As for my family life, nothing troublesome has been going on and I think that's because I've been expressing my opinions more, helping out with what my parents need to have done.
I came to know that I really like sports and being athletic. I also enjoy helping in the community and joined clubs. I feel like sports and clubs draw me more to school and being a student athlete supports being connected to my school community.
Lately, I've noticed that when I have balance in my life, I feel more excited and encouraged to continue with my daily activities like going to school. Everything seems to work smoothly, and I feel happy about it.
I have a personal relationship with my stepmom and sister, Mariah. I moved in with my dad and stepmom during my freshman year of high school, before which I lived in Utah. My stepmom and sister were already living there when I moved in.
I recently moved from Utah to California and experienced a lot of cultural differences. The transition was hard, but my sister Mariah helped me a lot in adjusting to the new environment and finding things I liked in my new school. However, I still struggled with finding a balance between family and schoolwork while trying to adapt to the new environment.
I enjoy spending time with my friend when I have the time to, like watching movies or playing basketball, but it's difficult for me to balance that with my schoolwork, especially on weekdays. Also, my sister Mariah is almost never home due to her job and school, and we have a normal sister relationship where we fight sometimes and steal each other's clothes.
I tend to prioritize spending time with my sister over my brother because she has a busier schedule and is older with more life experience. We typically hang out when she's off work, and I enjoy talking to her about my week and learning about college since I'll be going soon.
I've been really stressed lately, especially with trying to balance school, friends, and my family life. My family situation has been particularly stressful recently.
It's been really stressful at home lately. My siblings and my parents are fighting a lot, and it's affecting my ability to relax and do my schoolwork when I'm at home.
I am feeling stressed because of my relationship with my parents, siblings, and friends. While I play basketball with my friends, we don't really have time to hang out and talk on a personal level. We mostly discuss school and tests but not our emotions or personal problems.
I feel like finding balance in my life is important because it allows me to do my schoolwork, maintain relationships, participate in sports, and still have a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep.
I just started living with my dad and step mom at the beginning of my freshman year, and I've developed a closer relationship with my step mom since she's home more. We connect on girl-related stuff, like hair, makeup, boys, and she also gives me advice for school.
I find it helpful to talk to my friend when I come home, as it helps me de-stress and organize my thoughts. I feel overwhelmed when I don't get a chance to share my day or write things down. I have other friends, but we don't get to talk as much as I would like because we're usually busy with sports.
I feel like there is an imbalance in my life when I don't have enough time to hang out with my sister, or do my school work. Everything seems to run smoothly when I have a balance in my life and I can allocate time for my relationships, school, and friends. Earlier in the school year, it was easier for me to balance everything because I didn't have as much school work, but now it's been difficult.
I feel that my family is really important to me and I just want to make sure I spend time with them whenever I can, because I don't always have the chance to do so.
I feel really good to be a part of a community, like I fit in and belong somewhere. It's a good feeling in my heart and head to know that I can go to them. But when things start colliding, like messing up in school or not having time for my friends, I get stressed out because I feel like I'm letting someone down.
I have noticed that balance has its tentacles in different areas of my life, and when one area is impacted, it affects the others. It's crazy how much this affects my ability to move around and be okay.
I've been skipping school sometimes to catch up on my schoolwork because I'm overwhelmed with managing my relationships and fighting all the time with my siblings. However, I still end up falling behind, and I don't think there's a balance in my life right now.
As a patient, I am struggling with maintaining balance in my life, especially between my siblings and my school responsibilities. I try to prioritize what's important, but it has been difficult for me lately.
I'm worried about approaching the parents of a patient to discuss a situation that happened during my shift. It's risky because it could put the blame on another nurse I work with. But, I could tell the parents that I'm sorry for what they experienced, and that I did everything I could to help their child.
I constantly worry about my thoughts and feel the need to address them immediately. I think setting aside a specific time to deal with them might help me avoid feeling overwhelmed by them.
I've been experiencing intrusive worry thoughts and when I try to push them away, they seem to come back even stronger. It's like when someone tells you not to think about pink elephants, but then that's all you can think about. How can I deal with this situation?
I get in bed and then lie awake worrying about things, ruminating over them in my mind. It takes me hours to fall asleep, and it feels like I barely sleep at all. I try to read to distract myself from these thoughts, but it doesn't always work.
When I try to fall asleep, I tend to have worry thoughts that keep me awake. I try to read a book to distract myself but it doesn't always work. It's hard to fall asleep without holding the book. I'm thinking of trying to listen to music as well.
I have been having trouble sleeping due to my thoughts constantly going on throughout the night. I haven't tried any strategy to cope with this so far.
I recently experienced a situation at work where a child's parents were very upset with me. The mother accused me of harming her daughter, and I felt judged and blamed. I didn't get any closure in the situation, as the child was transferred, and I'm afraid I might have to interact with the parents again. I'm worried they'll see me as incompetent and responsible for their daughter's near-death experience.
I think having closure would be helpful. I believe I could absolve myself of the blame that they probably feel towards me. I would feel more comfortable if I repaired that interaction.
I feel like a failure, it was an awful situation. The parents were extremely upset and the child had to be moved to the ICU. Now, I can't sleep, I keep thinking about what could have been done differently and if I could have done something to change the outcome.
I can't stop the thoughts. They seem uncontrollable. I dread the idea of going back to work for fear something similar will happen again. It was almost impossible to get out of bed this morning. When I'm at work, I keep questioning every move I make - am I doing this right or wrong?
I've spent more time trying to sort out the pieces. I can't break the worry long enough to try to do something for me. I try to put a happy face on, but it's but usually I can try to at least have other people see it that way, but I can't even pull that up right now.
I didn't finish all of the forms and I had a dreadful day yesterday. I almost called you. At this point, I need to get through that episode.
Well, yesterday when I was doing my pediatric rotation, I had come on the floor and one of the children that I was taking care of, I was doing rounds on my patients and one patient in particular was more critical than the other, and as I went to assess that patient, another patient that was assigned to me coded, essentially. And I had just walked in on that, at the code and caught it as it was occurring and got the crew on board, and the patient was able to be resuscitated. However, it wasn't a fault directly of mine but it was due to the previous nurse who hung a bag of medication that this child was allergic to. The parents were in the room and they were upset, looking at me as if it was my issue, my problem. I feel like a failure.
I'm feeling confused and I'm second-guessing myself. I'm worried that I'm making mistakes in my work and not living up to my own standards, which also makes me question if I'm raising my children properly.
I've been feeling overwhelmed and doubtful about my choices lately, including my choice of husband. My mother says I'm not perfect, and it's hurting my confidence. When I think about my decisions, especially ones that might have been mistakes, I feel like the thoughts just keep going around and are uncontrollable.
I chose the wrong patient and now I'm struggling with the consequences. I understand why it happened, but I can't help feeling guilty and overwhelmed.
I don't have any strategies to manage my worry and low mood. I just force myself to go forward every day and do my obligations, like going to work and taking care of my children as best as I can. This situation has been overwhelming, and I haven't been able to put together enough energy to work through it.
I just feel sad. I feel as if I had just stepped, if I had swapped the order of assessing patients and assessed that child first, I would have looked at that bag to make sure the medication that was hung on the previous shift was the correct one. So I would have known when to clock the next bag, and I would have seen that it wasn't the right medication. But I, I made a choice to assess a child that I thought was more critical first, and technically, it would have been, normally, except that someone had hung the wrong bag.
I made a decision recently and deep down I know it's right but, I think hearing validation externally is helpful because it's difficult for me to believe in myself right now.
I'm still doubting even though I try to put the brakes on the thought. I try to think about the order of patients being correct and that I performed fine at that point.
I sometimes struggle with self-criticism, which makes it difficult for me to approach a certain family in a professional and supportive manner. But I believe I can do it if I treat it like a homework assignment and put my self-criticism on the back burner.
I think the intensity of my feelings regarding my parents yelling at me will soften. I feel like I made a mistake, but I know I made a good judgement based on the information I had. I've been working on handling my distress about the interactions with my parents by approaching them professionally and compassionately. However, I still struggle with sleep deprivation.
I've had ongoing sleep problems, and they have gotten worse recently.
I've been thinking about approaching someone regarding a situation where my daughter was resuscitated. I feel like they might be grateful for my presence during that time, and I want to do it in a more positive or neutral way to avoid putting blame on anyone. However, I'm also concerned about the idea of avoiding, as it may not be the best course of action. What do you think?
Lately, I've been thinking about a situation that happened at work regarding a family and their child's care. I know what I would advise a younger colleague to handle it - just address the family, show concern, and not apologize as it's not their fault. But I'm still worried about how to interact with the family without assigning blame.
I think I understand why I feel this way, because maybe I'm expecting too much of myself in how I've selected patients. Under normal circumstances, the patient I went to first would have been more critical. But if I had just swapped them, I could have prevented something bad from happening. It was just so hard seeing the parents' faces and thinking that they were critical of me and what kind of nurse must I be?
I tend to lose my confidence in my decisions, even when I know logically that I've done the right thing. I would love to be able to hold onto my confidence in a more consistent way, but it's still hard for me, especially when the situation is fresh and the consequences of my decisions are painful.
I feel that the strategies we have discussed are reasonable. The idea of not thinking about the thoughts at all seemed impossible, but putting them gently on the back burner makes more sense to me, and I'm willing to give it a try.
I had an unpleasant experience in the waiting room, which has left me feeling uncomfortable and hoping it doesn't happen again.
I don't feel unhealthy, and even though my levels are high, I feel busy and need smoking at the moment. I don't smoke that much, and it helps me relieve stress.
I have been waiting for 40 minutes since my appointment was supposed to be, and I came early. Others seem to have gone in before me even though they came in later. This feels unfair to me, and I have a meeting to attend at work which I need to be on time for.
I feel like I'm just a number on a conveyor belt, not being treated as an individual human being. It's very frustrating and makes me feel angry.
I was feeling slightly harassed before coming in, but now that I'm here, I feel better.
I just received the results of my blood tests and they are fairly high. I'm a little concerned about it. But when the counsellor wanted to talk about my smoking habits, I told them that I don't smoke that much and I don't want to talk about it right now.
I'm aware of the risks, but I don't think my smoking is a big issue for me. I'd rather not talk about it now. I have diabetes and understand that it puts me at greater risk for health problems, but I don't feel that my smoking is a problem for me right now.
I smoke and also have another health issue. It puts me at a higher risk, but I don't think it's a problem and I don't want to talk about it.
I'm always busy and living a fast-paced life. I find that smoking helps me slow down and unwind, like I'm taking a break in the slow lane.
I've been smoking for quite a while, and I'm not the only one in my circle. My husband smokes too, but we don't smoke inside the house.
I smoke outside, and it has become a part of my everyday home life and social life. I am concerned about the expense and I know it's not good for me, as I have heard it all my life.
I have diabetes and I've been coming to the clinic for it. But my main concern is about my smoking habit. I know it's not the first time we're discussing this, but I find it difficult to quit smoking since my friends and I usually smoke together.
Lately, I have been experiencing a lot of stress due to tight deadlines at work, and today, I had to wait for my routine diabetes check-up appointment, which caused me to be late for an important meeting. I feel humiliated and overwhelmed by the wait, and I haven't even gotten my results or had any time with my counselor yet.
I came into this appointment feeling really angry, mostly because it took so long in the waiting room. I don't mind talking about my smoking, but I don't want to be lectured or ordered around.
I've smoked for quite a long time. I enjoy it and it helps me when I'm stressed.
I find enjoyment in certain activities, and they help me when I'm stressed. I have a busy home life and work life, and I'm trying to balance a lot of things.
I see myself not smoking and I can't imagine being happy. I might cope with life, but I'm worried that I'll end up going back to cigarettes as my way of not coping.
I want to quit smoking, but I think it will take a lot of willpower. I am thinking of speaking to my husband about it and try to get him to quit as well. But I don't know how to do that.
I don't know exactly what, but I know there are patches and chewing gum that can help with my smoking addiction. It's an important part of my social life and helps me relax, but I'm aware that it's not good for my health, especially in the long run. I think if I could get my husband's support and find the willpower, maybe I could quit, but I'm not quite ready.
I don't think I'm ready yet, but it is something to have a chat again about with my husband.
I experienced the loss of two subjects very close to my heart, which changed my reality and brought anxiety. Before these incidents, I didn't worry about such things and didn't realize the destructive power that can suddenly change things. The experience made me feel the consequences and made me live with worry and anxiety.
I've experienced two sudden losses in my life that deeply affected me. One was the loss of my dog and the other, far more devastating, was the loss of my child. The shock of these sudden changes, from joy and nonchalance to pain and grief, has had a lasting impact on me.
I recently experienced a situation where my initial reaction was alarm and I felt the need to do whatever I could, as quickly as possible, to find someone who could help me fix it. I wished I could rewind time and change the outcome. It was a feeling of disbelief, like this couldn't really be happening.
I still remember vividly that a passenger rear tire hit my little Chihuahua terrier dog, Pepper. And I saw her rolling in the road, and I, just a little kid at that time, rushed towards her, scooped her up in my arms, and ran back to the house with her.
When I was running, I saw my dog lying down with its mouth open, and I noticed its pigmentation and the ridges on the roof of its mouth, which I had never seen before because it was always moving. Seeing my dog so still and different alarmed me, and I was crying a lot.
I found my dog lying lifeless with his mouth open, showing the pigment and ridges on the top of the roof of his mouth. This is not something I've ever seen in a living dog, and it's very different from when he's alive and playing. I'm alarmed by this awareness.
I had a strong emotional reaction when my dog was hit by a car. I can remember it vividly, and it caused a distinct feeling that is still with me.
I remember seeing my dog chasing a cab, which was normal for him. But then I heard the tire hit him and saw him rolling in the road. I ran as fast as I could, picked him up, and tried to get him back home. I was young, and the task was challenging. I wish I could rewind time and change what happened.
I was trying to help, and I saw Pepper running out into the road chasing after a cab. I called for him to come back, just like my mom usually does, but he didn't listen and kept running. Then, the cab's wheel ran over him, and I heard this horrible popping sound.
When I felt alarmed, I was holding my dog, and I experienced anxiety running through my chest, like it was about to burst or explode outward.
I was coming out of a situation and experienced a sensation that suddenly just stopped. I remember running towards my mom without seeing her, but knowing that she was there. Ever since the beginning, I felt something was wrong and I knew something was really bad.
I remember taking my injured pet to my mom, hoping she could fix the problem. I'm not sure if we took him to the vet or not, but I remember putting him in a shoebox and burying him in the backyard. My mom said she would take me to a toy store since I was a good boy through all this, but we never went to the toy store.
I remember a specific incident with my dog. He used to chase cars, and one day, he was in the middle of the road, and I saw him going under the passenger's side wheel of a car, followed by a sound that's unfamiliar to me. I've seen my dog do this before, but this time it was different.
I heard a different sound and saw my dog rolling in the street. I rushed out to pick him up and ran uphill as fast as I could with him in my arms. I noticed his mouth was open, and I could see his pigment and the rigidness.
I was playing with my child, and we were having a great time, rolling on the bed and laughing together. But suddenly, something felt not right, and it seemed different from anything before.
I was with someone when I noticed that they didn't look right. They didn't have the life in them that I expected, and they had shortness of breath. There was no prior history of anything like this happening, so I waited to see if it would pass, but I couldn't get a response from them.
I was with my friend and he needed medical help urgently. I ran with him to the car and drove him to the emergency care center. They rushed him in there and didn't waste any time at the front desk. However, the doctor told me that there's nothing he can do and my friend needs to go to the hospital. At that moment, I didn't know what to do.
I was praying that we had enough time to get to the hospital while my son was struggling to breathe. A lady from the front desk offered to drive us there. We took him to the emergency room, and the doctors gave him oxygen and stabilized him. But during that time, I had no idea if he would make it or not, which made me feel very anxious.
I went through a tough time when my child was hospitalized. They had to stabilize him, intubate him, and put him through a series of tests to find out what happened. The situations were really difficult for us.
I'm struggling to let my vigilance take a rest and commit to the ways I know will help me relax. I'm having a hard time prioritizing what's important, and I want to learn how to take life as it comes.
I'm currently focused on my own needs and how to improve myself. Although I understand that the changes I'm making will affect my family, I don't think it will have a dramatic impact on them. At this point, their reaction isn't a motivating factor for me. It's more about how these changes will affect me and my well-being.
I know I can handle crises and have proven to be dependable, but the uncertainty of when the next one will happen keeps me on edge. The slightest thing can trigger this stress and cause me to start reliving past events. I'm trying to work on giving myself messages that lower the bar and not wait for the gun to go off, but it's exhausting and the stress still pops into my chest and goes up my neck, even without the event happening.
I've learned some stuff over the past year, and now I'm at a point where I'm deciding whether I want to continue with this mindset. The tough decision is, do I want to put down this vigilance and allow myself to relax, or do I choose to allow my mind to pursue a different type of thought process, constantly assimilating and prioritizing what's critical?
I was supposed to be at the orchestra with Clara, but I couldn't make it because I had other things going on in my life. Clara was there playing the flute and kind of missing me, but it was impossible for me to be there.
I feel like my dad had a lot of things that prevented him from being there for me, but I'm not sure if he really wanted to be there or not.
It's hard for me to look at and imagine my past. When I was little, I always hoped someone would show up in the audience while I played in the orchestra, like maybe my grandmother.
When I was younger, I really enjoyed being a part of the school orchestra where I played the flute.
I used to play in an orchestra and I really missed the feeling of looking out into the audience and seeing my mom or dad there, but they never attended my performances.
I never lost hope, but every year, I faced disappointment. Everyone in the orchestra had someone there for them, and I really wanted you to be there for me.
I missed the kind of recognition for my hard work and talent. It was something I put a lot of effort into, but I felt lonely and disappointed that others didn't acknowledge or appreciate it.
I've been thinking a lot about my parents lately, and I feel more comfortable talking about my dad specifically. I think I'd like to focus on that right now, if that's okay with you.
I think you're amazing, and I feel so much love for you. It brings tears of love and a sense of caring but also protection against that.
When I think about how my mother would feel in this situation, I imagine she would be quite surprised.
I loved my mom very much, but now I don't know how much she talks or what's happening with her. All I remember is her asking me why I was crying when I used to feel fantastic around her.
I feel like my mom is always trying to protect me, but I just want her to let me do my own thing. I want to be able to ride my bike and do whatever I want without her constantly worrying about me.
I've been struggling to stay focused on my work lately because I just feel so playful, and I've been enjoying myself.
I feel extremely worried and helpless about not being there for my loved one when she needs me the most, and it's terrifying.
I am protective of my loved one, and I fear that something bad may happen to her. I've been through difficult situations before, and I am always left wondering if there is something else going to happen.
I feel grateful that things ended up okay, but I also have this feeling of not wanting anything to happen to her or not being there for her.
I feel that being there for my daughter has always been very important to me and still remains a pivotal part of my life. I feel responsible for her safety and well-being, and our connection appears to be strong.
I have a 3 year old, and 3 years ago I had quite a traumatic birth with her. She's my only child, and it's something I still struggle with now. I'm still quite impacted by it, and my main fear is losing her.
I went through a traumatic experience with my daughter, and both our lives were in danger. I still remember the fear of losing her, and it stays with me even during her life transitions.
I was very protective, and I still feel impacted by a difficult event that happened during my emergency cesarean. The medical staff held up my baby and gave her to my husband, and I thought that was the first and last time I would see her, as I thought I was going to die in that moment.
I started to decline after my friend wasn't alright, and then she was okay. But it was just that image, and I fear that she won't have me.
I wanted you in my life for so long, but I find it unbearable. I'm afraid that I may see you for the last time.
I feel so much longing for being with my partner, and I have a fear of losing them. I want to tell them that I'm sorry they had that experience.
I've been struggling recently with a difficult situation that brings up images in my mind. It feels like a trauma and I keep thinking about maybe losing someone. I wanted to protect them, but felt helpless.
I felt completely helpless during the whole experience, and so much happened so quickly with people I didn't know. It's traumatizing, and I didn't want my baby to be affected.
I have been having a hard time expressing my feelings and emotions, but I've finally managed to overcome that, and I am proud of myself.
Recently, I have been reflecting on my experiences and I feel a mix of pride and sadness. I am proud of what I have endured, but there are also things that I miss, fear for my daughter, and aspects that still ache from time to time.
Hi, I recently went through a traumatic situation and I am struggling with it. I'm not sure how to deal with my feelings and emotions. I brought some dahlias to the session, I hope that's okay.
It's good to hear that she sees what a great mom I am and that I'll be there for my daughter, but it makes me miss her because she's no longer here. She has passed on.
I really miss someone who passed away, and it's difficult for me because they have never seen my daughter. I wish they could have met her, as I feel like it would have been good for both my daughter and the person I lost.
I'm struggling with feeling like I'm unable to be there for my parents, especially my dad. I'm not sure what to say to them to acknowledge this.
I've been feeling unresponsive lately and I understand that there was so much more going on. I felt rejected by the people around me and it's really complicating my emotions.
I have moments when I realize that I am missing someone very close to me, and during those times, I tend to rely on you a lot. Sometimes, I even feel like you're my daughter. I feel like I need you for myself as well.
I find myself thinking about how the absence of a parent impacts my own daughter, and how those moments make me realize what I missed in my own childhood. It seems like the pain caused by that absence is magnified sometimes.
I miss my close relationships, receiving advice and guidance, and intimate moments like hand-holding that I used to have. I remember even a complete stranger once held my hand.
I felt like there was nobody to advocate for me if something went wrong. I wanted someone to hold my hand, guide me, and protect me.
I have been so focused on protecting someone else that I didn't even have time to look at how the situation was impacting me. It has affected me a lot, and it's quite scary.
I needed my parents there. I think both of them should have been there for me.
I feel disappointed when I picture both of them, because they are not there and they never have been.
It's almost impossible for me to say, the level of hurt that has caused me.
I have this memory of when my mother came home after a long time, and she brought gifts for Ramadan. I found her hiding spot for the gifts in the closet, and it felt special to me, even though I knew we might get in trouble.
I am looking to develop a career in the counseling field, and I would like your help to best navigate that path. Maybe you could share with me what I could do to move in that direction and how I can best be successful in that path. One of my earliest memories is when my mother, who was in the service, went away to basic training and then came back.
I remember my first recollection with my mom. She was coming home and I was in the store. I ran after her, super fast, like a sprint to love, and when I got home, she had a new bike for me.
I'm struggling to come up with an action verb for the second recollection I had during our last session. I remember playing with my family.
I remember being bigger and taller than everyone else at Chicago Care, but I'm not sure if I can come up with an action verb to describe that experience.
I have a favorite saying by Maya Angelou: 'When you learn, teach'. It's important to me because I believe in passing on knowledge to others.
I have grown to appreciate how hands-on my mother was during my childhood. I remember attending kindergarten at a place called Chicago Child Care Society, and it just makes me feel thankful for my mother's involvement in my life.
I attended a school where it catered to children with differences as well, and one event that stands out to me is when I was kicked in the stomach by a boy named Daniel.
I remember having a teacher named Ms. Salahuddin who spoke in a low, caring tone and dressed well. I always admired her and wanted to be like her. I've been told that I present myself similarly, but I struggle with how others view me and how I view myself.
As the patient, I feel strongly about the importance of giving back and learning because my mother taught me this. In my experience, when people give me their time and teach me things, it shows they genuinely care. I want to be significant in someone else's life and help them be independent and thrive by sharing my knowledge.
I find myself drawn to people who teach and are free givers of their knowledge. I'm attracted to smart individuals who are willing to share information. One person who was an indirect role model for me wasn't necessarily in my life.
I have been trying to improve communication with my sister and my husband. I think my sister is learning to understand my perspective, and I feel like I've figured out how to get through to her.
I tend to get annoyed with people who get on my nerves, but I don't have this issue with my parents because they don't bug me.
I don't get upset with most people, but there are some who know how to get to me. I'm trying to learn how to not let them affect me, but it's so hard to follow through.
I can be frustrated or upset over something that happened during the day, and my sister will call. I guess it's because I had control with my emotions to begin with, since I didn't allow them to overwhelm me when I was interacting with my sister and husband on Sunday.
I become defensive and upset when I'm already bothered by other things during the day. Things just seem to pile up. But on days when I'm feeling mellow, like this past Sunday, I can handle situations a lot better and don't let things get to me.
I feel like I'm lacking self-control in my life, and I wish I could learn to take things with a grain of salt and just move on.
I'd be easy going, not constantly thinking all the time, and would stop overanalyzing situations. I just want to throw it up to the wind and accept that's life.
I am struggling with thinking that some situations might be the end of the world for me.
I sometimes look at a situation and study it too much and think that my whole world revolves around the decision that I make, or how I react. When in essence it doesn't.
I used to be more easy going, not stressed out, and more fun to be around. I am married and live with my husband.
I'm not sure what my partner would say when I ask him about his feelings.
As a patient, I often blow things out of proportion and feel like those things only happen to me. I'd like to realize that many of these are just normal everyday occurrences and that I'm no different than anybody else. I believe that understanding this will give me peace of mind.
I often feel like I'm the only one who is struggling, constantly pulling my hair out in frustration. I understand that the things that happen to me may be similar to others, but my reaction to these situations is what makes me unique.
I've been feeling overwhelmed by certain things happening in my life, and I tend to get frantic about them. But now, I am learning to be much more calm and composed.
I feel like I struggle to stay calm when faced with difficult situations, and I would like to be able to handle life's challenges with more composure.
I believe that when my partner comes home angry and uses a harsh tone or loud voice, remaining calm and composed helps diffuse the situation. I've tried this approach before and it seems to work.
I've been able to make my partner feel better by doing something that he wanted, like picking up the house. The most recent time I did this was on Sunday when he was upset about the house being messy after having company over.
I had a disagreement with my partner over cleaning the house. He wanted it cleaned immediately, but I didn't feel like doing it right away. He accused me of never cleaning and always being gone. Instead of giving in, I refused to clean and decided to go out for a while. He seemed surprised by my reaction and asked where I was going.
You know, it just, it's horrible. It sounded like I was playing a trick on him, but it works. It was different for me, what I did on Sunday. It took a lot of initiative on my part to do that. Most of the time, I would have probably said, I'm not doing it, you know, and it would have-
I think my partner would notice a significant change in my behavior. He would say that nothing gets to me anymore, and he'd be surprised at how well I'm handling things.
Recently, I've been discussing my issues with someone close to me, and he constantly asks questions like, 'how long is it going to last?' or 'what have you been drinking?' He knows that I have a tendency to read different books and try various ideas to handle life.
I recently had a conversation with a friend, who noticed that I was setting aside my self-help books. When I told him that I didn't get my recent improvement from a book, he seemed surprised and curious to know what's really going on with me. He usually finds me easy-going and fun to be around.
I believe my partner would be calmer if I took control and started over. I think he wouldn't have such a quick temper.
Lately, there have been instances where someone is trying harder to get at me, upset me, and it's really affecting me. This is a genuine issue and I need help to deal with it.
I don't know how I made that decision. I was just tired and I've been through a similar pattern before.
I knew it was coming. By the comments he made, I just thought I'm not gonna do it again. I'm not gonna argue with him. I'm not gonna get upset. I just know, and I'm just gonna get out of here for a while. It takes almost guts on my part to do that.
It wasn't hard to decide, but it was hard to carry it through. I guess it's the will inside of me that helped me to overcome the challenge.
I am sometimes really strong-willed, but other times I am not. It depends on how I'm feeling at that particular moment. One thing I really dislike about myself is that I let my emotions take too much control.
I didn't do it on Sunday and I think it was because of self-control.
I just, it wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth the argument. It wasn't worth the effort to even uhm.
I feel like my partner doesn't understand that my PMS symptoms cause me to be more sensitive and thinks I shouldn't have any of those symptoms. I believe he deliberately agitates me more during that time, and it bothers me more. I think our relationship is at a six because of this issue, but he believes he doesn't do anything differently.
As a patient, I would say that my partner thinks I would move from a four to a six on his scale when I don't throw any fits, there's no more slamming, and no more yelling. This is how he would know I have improved in handling disagreements.
When I get mad at my partner over something he did, I sometimes slam the cabinet doors. I know he doesn't like it and it bothers him, but I do it more just to get at him than to release my anger.
I'm trying to pick my battles more effectively, deciding when to stand up for myself and when to let things go. I usually have a plan worked out, but if I'm unsure, things can get out of control.
I have this issue where if I'm set on doing something, I don't let anything stand in my way. I listen to others' objections, but ultimately, I do what I want because I've already made up my mind. That's when I feel like I have real control. I guess you could call it picking a battle.
I'm determined to go through with a certain decision, despite what others may say. For example, last Sunday, I didn't want to fight or argue about it, so I didn't let anything bother me.
I have decided that I'm not going to let someone bother me anymore, no matter what they say. I made this choice because I didn't want to fight.
I feel like I've been in certain places before even when I'm visiting it for the first time, for example at an airport. I also mentioned that there has always been a distance between my kids and their grandmother due to geographic separation.
I feel like my children don't have a strong sense of family because of the distance and our busy lives. I want them to be okay with who they are, just like my mom taught me. They have different personalities, and I want to pass on the lesson of self-acceptance to them.
I think that one of the reasons why I've worked so hard to get where I am today is because I can survive on my own. I noticed the struggles my mother went through to care for her kids and that made me stronger. It's made me work hard so that I can take care of myself and my kids without having to be in a relationship for financial reasons. I don't think my mother realizes that what I saw growing up has made me even stronger and strive to be the best I can be.
I think my mother would be okay with my honesty about my past experiences. It might bother her a bit, but I believe she can get past that. I feel that the challenges I've faced have made me a stronger person, and I think she would appreciate that.
I think it's great to have this conversation about my mom. She's very important to me, even in death. Although she made mistakes in her personal relationships, I understand that it was her way of trying to take care of us. I've come to terms with some of the choices she made, but there's one step-father in my life that I could probably do without.
Growing up, I struggled to understand why my mom married such a mean person and subjected us to that life. But now, looking back, I think it was just survival. I've learned that I have to be strong, stand on my own, and be part of a relationship. My husband and I have been married for 27 years, but if he were to leave, I know I can survive.
As a patient, ever since my mom's death, I've continued to hold onto the belief that no one can change me. I interact with others based on my own choices and emotions. I believe this mindset has grown stronger as I've gotten older. I don't consider myself stubborn, I just don't want anyone to think they can change me. I'm very comfortable with who I am and that includes how I connect with my mom now.
Well I keep my mom's photo on my refrigerator, and I look at her smile regularly. It reminds me of my youngest's smile. As I get older, I hope I never lose the ability to hear her voice because it frightens me. Sometimes I try to sit and bring her voice, but it only comes when I think I need it. I'm hoping, as long as I'm on this earth, that I can always hear her voice because I think she has definitely contributed to who I am as an individual.
I have a special connection with someone who calms me when I hear her voice, but I haven't told anyone else about this connection yet.
My mother was a maid and a very hard worker. She had 12 children to support. She was also a seamstress and would find nice pieces to mend. This has influenced my love for shopping at thrift stores since we used to do that when I was a little girl.
I remember my grandmother as a resourceful woman and a giver. I think that's why she was able to survive and take care of her 12 kids.
I recently lost my mother in 2005. We had a unique relationship. I come from a big family of 12 siblings, and my mother worked a lot, so she wasn't around much. However, I always felt her support in everything I wanted to do. She always emphasized the importance of education and being the best person I could be.
I went off to college and I felt like I had my mom's support even though we weren't in regular touch. When I lost her at the age of 76, I knew that time would come, but it created a void for me. My family isn't close and sometimes when I need my mom, I hear her voice, which may seem weird to some.
Sometimes when I'm sleeping, her voice actually wakes me up. And I'm looking around, thinking, you know. But I know it's because she's always gonna be with me, and when I hear her call my name, anything that I'm dealing with, it, it kinda, it doesn't just, it doesn't go away, but it allows me to actually deal with it the way that I should.
I want to keep a memory alive, but I feel like if I don't try occasionally to bring it back, it'll disappear. I don't want it to disappear, and I think it's important as it keeps the memory alive.
I really do think that she was very unique. She may not have thought she was, but I think she was. And I think people could learn from me telling her story.
I always tell people not to let others change who they are. I'm a giver by nature, and if I want to give something to someone, I don't need anyone's approval for it. I've learned this from my mom, who was a single parent raising 12 kids. People might have looked down on her, but she never let that bother her.
I've tried to stay true to myself and not let others change me, but sometimes I worry that not everyone functions like me, and it's led to some disagreements. When I was a child, I was a bit different from my siblings - they were outgoing, and I wasn't as much.
I found it very uncomfortable for me to walk into a building with a lot of people, as I felt their eyes on me. I didn't like that feeling. Most of my younger years, I spent reading. I loved to read, and I would often get lost in books, which made me a bit different from my siblings.
I think my neighbors were more responsive to us because my mom was always giving, even when we didn't have much. She was good at teaching us how to be kind and generous.
Well, one of the things I think is important is that no matter what happens in your life, no matter what types of relationships you have, I
I spoke with Lorraine about my sense of void due to the loss of my mom. At the moment, the void didn't exist, but it'll always be there. I don't think the void will permanently disappear.
I wouldn't say the void disappears totally, but talking about my mother helps me. I can't really describe how it helps me, but she was a good person, and if I can tell everybody that I meet about her, then that's a good thing. I think the way she raised us and the things she tried to teach us are very good values for others to use. But, I do get emotional about it.
I've been hearing a voice that gives me a really good feeling. It doesn't scare me, and it actually comforts me.
I hear a voice occasionally at night, and it doesn't scare me. It's almost comforting to know that she's still thinking about me. If I concentrate really hard and close my eyes, I can hear her say my name. But I'm frightened that one day, I won't be able to do that anymore.
I think it could have been that I'm just proud of my mom. It was great to kind of share my experiences with her growing up, and it also felt good that other people thought she was a good person based on the information I shared.
I think it's always good to think about how I want people to remember me. I would like them to remember me as a caring individual and a person who has worked hard, like my mom.
I have always been proud of my mom and I like to share how she raised us. I hope people can learn from my experience. Every morning, I wake up and try to be the best person I can be.
I feel grateful for my mom, as she helped me become the best person I could be. I believe I was able to share that feeling with others today, but also I mentioned feeling a sense of void since my mom is not around.
Since my loved one passed away, there are times when I hear her calling my name. It's not different in any way, it's just the same as when she was alive.
Sometimes I wake up after having gone to bed with a lot of things on my mind. I think it's a symbol to say that I'm here, just to calm me. When I was growing up, my mother supported me a lot, and I think sometimes I need that support as I go through life. I don't think it's weird or anything.
Sometimes, I talk to my late mother in my mind to seek comfort and calmness. I hear her voice, and it helps me deal with whatever is on my mind. I don't worry about others thinking it's weird because my mom always told me to be okay with my choices, and that's what matters.
I don't think my mother would have realized how much she influenced me in the little things in life. I believe if it wasn't for her underlining approval and pushing me, I could have gone either way. I think I respected her enough that she knew I wouldn't want to disappoint her.
I think, at a time in my life, you know, the years from high school and going into college, I definitely didn't want to disappoint my mother, I just wanted to make her happy.
I think my mother would be proud to know that I'm going back to school at my age and actually being successful.
I don't think my kids connect their sense of identity and being okay with who they are with my mom, their grandmother. I believe they associate it with me, but I want them to realize that their acceptance of themselves is somewhat a carryover from their grandmother.
I believe my mother would appreciate hearing that I still need her. She worked really hard, even though she didn't have a lot of time, and she passed away from bladder cancer due to the chemicals she was exposed to in her job as a maid. I think her influence on me is something she would be glad to know about, but she might be surprised by the extent of it, since she was constantly working during my upbringing.
I sometimes feel like my mom wasn't there for me because she didn't have a lot of time. But I knew I had to do my homework and even though she wasn't standing over me, I made sure I completed it.
I was somewhat strong-willed growing up, and my mother had curfews, which I often broke. One night in high school, she warned me that if I returned home past 11:30, all my belongings would be outside. I didn't believe she would do that, but when my friend dropped me off past the curfew, our house was on the corner, and when we turned the curve, there it was.
I remember that one night when my mom threw all my clothes in the yard. I was really into clothes back then, always getting them from the cleaners. I realized that she knew how to get to me and that incident has taught me to follow through. Since then, I've learned to work with what I have and appreciate it. My mom was always proud of me, especially when I went off to school.
When I was little and would get lost in a book, I would hear my mother's voice calling me. It's a memory that has always been with me.
I honestly don't think my mother knew how much she has inspired me. She did a lot in her life, and it wasn't really clear when or how she did it, but I know she did. When I hear her voice now, she's just calling my name, and it feels like she's saying 'I'm here.' It's very calming, and I don't think she knew how much she inspired me.
I just had a conversation about my mom and it went well. I enjoy talking about her and it actually made me feel a sense of release and lightness.
Sometimes I feel like I'm too hard on myself, like pushing myself to get that 4.0 when I'm already managing everything just fine. But I can't help but feel insecure about myself and struggle with self-esteem issues.
I remember back in college when I lived with a bunch of guys, and one day I snapped after my roommates picked on me and we got into a big fight. I've come a long way since that time when I didn't know what I was going to be and wasn't getting very good grades. I even got kicked out for drinking, which ultimately helped me sober up.
I got thrown out the first time I went to college, and now I'm trying to maintain my sobriety. I go to meetings, but I don't know how often I should attend to keep up my sobriety.
I used to attend support group meetings seven nights a week when I lived in Madison. However, now I only attend three or four times a week, usually on Sundays, Thursdays, sometimes Fridays, and too many on Saturdays.
I always felt like adults appreciated my intelligence and responsibility, but I struggled to connect with my peers. I did have a small group of friends that I still communicate with, and some other intermittent friends, but I felt like a late bloomer with the nickname 'moose'.
I think maybe I had a late development. I am not sure, but I think my puberty might have been late.
I was young for my grade, and I think that might have led to some issues. I was only 12 in the ninth grade when most people were 13, and I graduated high school at 17. Also, I am the youngest child in my family with just one older sibling.
I feel like my friend is not really hanging on to me, but she still expects me to do some things for her. She's trying to maintain our relationship by wanting to see me once a month, but I'm not so sure about it.
Lately, I've been feeling like my partner doesn't let me be myself. For example, I told her I was going to wear a dark shirt with a tie and a jacket, but she just criticized my choice saying that dark shirts don't look good.
I have had various jobs during my college years, and now I am feeling uneasy about the whole concept of graduating, sending out resumes, and starting a career. I'm not sure what I think about it all.
I'm not really sure about the type of job I'll get with my education. I'm 26 and I know my friends have real jobs after graduating college. I think I'm highly marketable but I'm scared that no one will want me. I also feel like I have a legacy of being a bit of a screw-up.
I have been sober for about six and a half years now. Back in college, I didn't quite fit in with any groups, including the sports teams I was on. I've had periods where life has been really tough and people made fun of me for various reasons.
I've faced some tough moments in my life where I was made fun of, mainly because of how I handled things or my reactions towards certain situations. I feel like I brought this upon myself.
I'm struggling to find time for everything. Last weekend, I went walking with friends and enjoyed, but I don't know if it was because I was sick or just tired from the accumulated tension. I also have a family life with my wife that I need to invest in.
I was sick recently with some sort of flu, and it seems like more than one person around me has had it as well. My wife is really encouraging me to take care of myself, study, and also have some sanity time. How should I handle this increased workload right now?
I had agreed to attend my sister's baby shower this weekend, but now I'm feeling overwhelmed with my studies, and I don't want to go. My parents even rearranged the date for me, but I'm not looking forward to the six-hour round trip, and I feel like I should stay and study instead.
I am not sure if I feel that my dad didn't protect me enough from my mom, but today I felt weary of letting you get too close to private areas of myself.
I don't know why, but it's always easier for me to avoid talking about my issues. Even though my life is going well, I still feel stressed and unhappy. I know I'm here to try to get better, so I reluctantly talk about stuff.
I am thinking that my mother feels particularly attached to me because she had to get rid of a fetus in order to make room for me and be able to take care of me properly. Does it make sense to discuss this with her?
I feel conflicted about betraying my aunt by speaking up, but I believe my mom is more important. However, it's easier to discuss life with my aunt as she's more open compared to my mom.
Even if she doesn't agree, it's easier for my aunt to not agree with what I'm doing than it is for my mom to not agree with what I'm doing. My aunt is my mom's older sister.
I have a younger sister, and I feel like my mother was too close to me. I always found her presence in my life a bit overwhelming and sometimes, I feel more comfortable around my aunt because she wasn't as close and controlling as my mother.
Lately, I've been feeling like I need some space to breathe, and I realized that I haven't talked much about my father.
I am feeling overwhelmed right now. I have a month left for my classes, but it feels like I have two months' worth of work to do. I am not good at budgeting my time and figuring out when things need to be done. I feel frustrated, and it seems like even when I do things, the pile of work left doesn't get any smaller. I have a test tonight and another one tomorrow that I haven't prepared for.
I work about 29 hours a week, and I attend school on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On weekends, I know I need to study, but I don't seem to get as much time as I'd like. One of my classes requires computer assignments that take around six hours each, and I have five left before the semester ends. The professor acknowledges the time-consuming nature of the assignments, but I'm overwhelmed.
I'm 26 and I feel like I'm a bit behind in life because I don't have a house yet. I'd like to have a lot of things, but I also know that I've done things in my life that others haven't, like making it out to California.
I've done stuff like traveling in the states and I'm sober. I always look at things as trade-offs, like I could be working full time, but instead I'm going to school, doing something I like to do and learning things I like.
I am struggling because I want to be up-to-date with my classes, graduate today, buy a new motorcycle, and do a lot of things like maybe even move to Santa Fe. But, I know these things relate to my future.
As a patient, I am concerned about my mother's abortion secret and although I agree that it's none of my business, I can't help but wonder about the implications and reasons behind it. For instance, did my parents really want the child but couldn't afford it? I know that my mother got pregnant again soon after I was born.
I have been going through some difficulties in my life, and these challenges are causing problems for me both emotionally and financially.
I'm my mother's youngest child, with a sister who is older than me. I am the only boy in the family. I don't live in Wisconsin.
I haven't been able to see my parents as much as I would like, especially during school time. Last summer, I saw my mother at least once a month, but during the school year, it's much less frequent. My parents have only visited my school twice in the last two years. However, I'm doing well academically - I've been on the dean's list and received two scholarships.
I recently received two scholarships that I had applied for based on my grade point average and financial need. Along with the scholarships, I also received a small plaque with the school information on it, but I'm not sure about some other stuff that came with it.
I don't remember all the details, but I received a National Merit Scholar Award. There were like four or five things on that and two of them were in the dean's list, two of them where the scholarships, and there might be one or two other ones, like a National All American Scholar.
I told my mom to leave it up to fate for the most part, and I said I can be there on the 29th. Now I feel obligated and it's causing me pain. My mom is not the kind of person I can explain this problem to.
I have a complicated relationship with my mom. Sometimes, we can communicate well and be upfront with each other, but other times, it doesn't work that way, and I end up blurting things out that sound cold or rude. I worry about hurting her feelings, but I also feel a lot of stress when trying to balance time spent with her against my other responsibilities.
I feel guilty when I upset my mother, and I'm not sure if she's causing it or if I'm doing it to myself. She's a really formidable person.
I have a job and I'm paying for school, but I'm struggling financially. My wife and I both have debt, and it's a shared issue. We're not financially sound and I could not use my charge card as much.
I've been struggling with overspending and using my credit cards too much. It's been about a month and a half since I last used them, and I'm doing alright now. Before that, I would charge everything from clothes to gas, food, and even movie tickets. I guess I was living a little better than I could actually afford.
I've been struggling with financial issues. It started when we moved here, we bought a lot of stuff for our apartment on credit card like lamps and towels. Unexpected expenses like car repairs and renting cars have also come up. In general, we tend to spend more than we earn.
I feel like I have an overuse of alcohol, and it's spiraling out of control. I've taken steps to end it by looking for support among others with the same problem. There's a part of my personality that I'm still working on, like being impatient and tired of living like a poor college student at 26. I compare myself to my friends who have more stable lives and it affects me.
I am feeling a lot better mentally this semester compared to last year. I had a tough time with a different job and school last year, but now I have a decent job related to my major, and things are looking good for me. I think even if I don't get all A's this semester, it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I will be graduating with a degree in Management Information Systems in December.
I have been studying computer networking and stuff like that. I hope this will make me marketable and help me to get a good salary, especially in this area.
I feel a lot of pressure at school, not because I can't handle the work, but because I want to do it very well in the limited time available. My wife and I have also talked about moving to Mexico. I'm just desperate to be finished with school and start working.
I'm feeling anxious about graduating and having to find a real job. I've had decent experiences with work in the past, but those jobs were just for passing the time. My current job is more focused on my career goals, but I'm still worried about finding a job in my field after graduation.
Lately, I have been feeling stressed and overwhelmed, so I decided to focus on a new hobby to distract myself. I found that repairing furniture has been therapeutic, and I wanted to share this with you.
I have found some close connections here who are more genuine and can express their feelings and discuss being overwhelmed in school. However, I don't really connect with the partiers and drinkers and refrain from engaging in frat-talk.
I feel like I got lucky because I would be in jail now if I had been drinking. I had a third degree felony charge for risking and causing catastrophe due to drunken driving.
During my blackout, I apparently banged two propane tanks together, causing a leak. I didn't know what was happening at the time, and only found out when someone chased me. The event itself happened a couple of days prior, but the whole thing only surfaced in my mind a few weeks ago.
I went through probation for two years, and it should be wiped off my record by now. But I'm still feeling reluctant to believe that someone would want to hire me despite being highly marketable. I'm worried if prospective employers would know about this history.
I've been struggling with fitting everything into my schedule lately and not getting enough sleep. Even though I'm still recovering from being sick, I feel like I'm on the upswing. I'm just trying to juggle a lot of things in my life right now.
I'm glad I didn't just give up and stay working at the gas station for six bucks an hour. I don't always understand why my wife loves me, but we talk about it and she loves who I am and how I treat her and things that I bring to her life.
I feel like my partner appreciates the little things I do for her, like making her lunch and having meaningful conversations. I think she also likes that I am a feeling person and can express my emotions.
I used to live in a house full of guys back in college, and now I live with my wife. I feel like I'm not able to express my feelings the way I used to, and I'm worried that my old college buddies might tease me about it.
I have noticed that the opportunities for teasing have changed. I feel like people around me have become more mature, and I have to adjust to this.
I'm not really sure what the big deal was, but it seemed like a big deal to me at the time. I feel like I might be blowing it off now, but I'm not sure.
I just got some accolades in the mail, but I don't really know what they are. I was nominated for All American Scholar, and I have to respond soon. I used to be a C student, but now I have a 4.0 GPA. I'm paying for my own school, I'm married, and overall I think I'm doing well.
I've been managing to maintain a stable family life, and I feel like I could probably just go through the rest of the semester and do alright. But I want to do better than alright. My wife and I have talked about it, and it's stressful because we both have this perfectionist idea that I need to get a 4.0 GPA.
I feel like everything is my fault and all my responsibility. I'm the one who's here, and we're talking about the way I see things.
I came in to talk about my concerns regarding Sharon's behavior. I've tried to make her stop going to school and doing what she's doing, but it doesn't seem to be working. If she wasn't doing this, things wouldn't be like this.
I'm not feeling very good this week. My wife Sharon wants to go to a State Nursing Conference and will be away with her friends for a couple of nights. I'm upset because I feel like her actions are negatively affecting our marriage.
I am feeling upset because my partner said she doesn't want me with her for a weekend. It doesn't feel good to be left alone for the weekend, and I am worried about our future.
I'm worried because my wife is going away for two days, and I'll be alone in the house. My son has football and will be away for the weekend, and my daughter is staying with a friend. I'm afraid that being alone will be lonely and terrible.
I feel lonely and empty when people aren't around, especially when my spouse Sharon is going to be away for two days at a nursing conference. I don't know what I am going to do during those two days, and I might just sit around and do nothing.
I've been sitting at home feeling bad and I don't know what to do. I thought about mowing the lawn, but I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do. I just don't know.
When I think about being alone, I feel incredibly sad and depressed. My sadness is at a 90 out of 100, and my depression is at an 85. When I think about being left alone, it also makes me very angry, as high as a 95 out of 100.
I feel really depressed and sad because my partner is going to the conference and I feel abandoned. I don't think they're treating me fairly and it upsets me the most.
I'm feeling sad, angry, and depressed often because I feel like I'm being abandoned by Sharon, who is going to a conference without me. I'm not sure what will happen.
I was discussing with my counsellor how our thoughts and perception can affect how we see the world. We used the analogy of wearing different colored glasses and how they can change the color of a lemon, but the true color of the lemon is still yellow.
I've been feeling really depressed lately, and I thought it's because of the problems I have been facing with Sharon. But I'm not quite sure if that's the main reason.
I am willing to read a book between now and our next session, but I'm not sure which book you're recommending. Can you please clarify?
I went back to the bowling alley by myself, and I had a nice time. I'm still good at it.
I saw a sign about a league starting up and I thought maybe I might join. I believe it would make me feel more independent and I wouldn't be at home every night with nothing to do, especially when my partner Sharon is busy with her classes and library.
I've been feeling lonely lately and thought of doing something to make friends and feel appreciated. I'm thinking of joining a bowling team because I'm good at it. Do you think it is a good idea?
I feel like maybe my anger comes from feeling incompetent and thinking that I need to be cared for. I want to be more independent and do things for myself. What have I learned from therapy that can help me with this?
As a patient, I've realized that it's not the situations or things that are the problem, but rather the way I view them. Like the glass illustration, it's all about perspective.
I feel worse when these thoughts come to my mind. Everything is upside down. I'm the primary caretaker, I have a job, I make the money, I pay for everything. My wife is supposed to take care of the house and raise the children, but she's not doing that anymore.
I thought my wife was just going to take a class on Saturdays or one evening a week, and it wouldn't interfere with her household work. But now, she's out there all the time, studying for exams, going to the library, having study groups with her friends, or going off and doing stuff with them. She's not home, and I have to do everything. I'm not supposed to do that.
I mentioned that my partner is in a two-year nursing program and is just starting her second year. Since she's been going to school, we've been having a lot of problems and there's still another year to go. We end up fighting a lot.
I feel like the therapy has been good, but there are still some other things I'd like to work on. I am angrier than I used to be, and I don't feel as happy as before. I think my spouse and I could still do more work in our marriage. So I'd like to work together some more. What do you think?
I feel a little relieved about continuing therapy, as I like coming here and talking with you. I was afraid that after 10 sessions, it would be over. We've been discussing my anger issues and trying to improve my relationship with Sharon.
I need to be cared for, and I want others to appreciate what I do. When I think about these things, I feel angry, and I don't know why.
I had a nice day by myself. I went bowling, went to the movies, and later had dinner. My mom asked me about it, and I realized that I can be by myself and it's not so bad. I actually had a good time.
I managed to have a good time by coming up with a plan and deciding on things I would do, which helped me. Instead of sitting at home and worrying, I went out and did those activities. It wasn't great, but it wasn't so bad either.
I was initially reluctant to start therapy, thinking we'd have only three sessions. However, it has been helpful. My relationship with Sharon is improving; she listens to me when I express my feelings. I'm also learning to take care of myself, represent my interests, and understand what I want to do for myself.
I'm not really sure why I'm here, but my wife thinks I should be. Things haven't been going great at home since she went back to school, and our whole life has been disrupted.
I feel overwhelmed and angry because my wife has gone back to school and it has disrupted our routine. I work all day and come home wanting to relax, but now I have more responsibilities like doing the laundry and fixing dinner. This is not how I was raised, and I feel like she is not taking care of the house like she is supposed to.
Recently, I've been feeling overwhelmed, angry, down, and sad. I just don't see why I should be feeling like this.
I feel overwhelmed because I think I should have to do all of these tasks.
I haven't felt competent much lately, but when I think that I'm competent, I feel better. However, when I think I'm incompetent and a loser, I feel lousy and angry.
I feel angry and upset because I think I'm incompetent. If I believed that I was competent, I would probably feel better.
I went out for Chinese food, went bowling, and went to the movies on different occasions. After each event, I actually felt better and competent.
I feel competent when I do things for myself. I feel better when I am cared for, but I want to differentiate between liking it and needing it.
I am worried about not being able to see my counselor if I have a problem. I feel abandoned thinking about not seeing him anymore.
I'm feeling similar to when Sharon went away, and now that we won't see each other every week, I feel like I am out of the phase of the earth.
I feel like I need to be cared for, and I also feel incompetent when I can't do things myself. I get really angry because of this, especially since my partner, Sharon, stopped taking care of me when she went back to school. Now, I find myself feeling angry in both situations.
I've been feeling angry because I need to be taken care of all the time. As a grown man, I shouldn't be dependent on others. Is there something I can do to feel better about myself?
As a patient, I'm telling you that I have an important job with a lot of responsibility and I perform it well. I've been promoted regularly, received bonuses, and taken over additional departments.
I recently bought a home and a car and can meet all my bills and pay for insurance. I think I am competent as a father because I used to help my children with their homework, attend their little league games, and perform other fatherly duties.
I feel like once I accepted that she was going to leave and I couldn't do anything about it, I made sure she had enough money and could go out with her friends to have a nice time. I believe she did, and that made things easier for me.
I had a decent weekend. On Friday night, I went out for dinner to a Chinese restaurant. It wasn't great but it was okay. I even brought my book and had a nice time. However, I'm worried if people thought I was a weird guy for eating alone at the restaurant.
I had a pretty normal day on Saturday. I got up, did the lawn, and went bowling in the afternoon. It was amazing and I had a nice time. It felt good to be there.
On Saturday night, I went out for dinner at a Chinese restaurant and ran into a coworker with his wife. I joined them for dessert and had a nice time. I went to a movie afterward, and when I got home, there were messages from my wife, Sharon, who called all day because she was worried, and I think, a little jealous.
I come home from work at 5:00 o'clock, and there's a note from Sharon asking me to make dinner. Usually, I expect dinner to be on the table at 5:30. So, the kids come in and ask what's for dinner, and I suggest pizza, but they want McDonalds. Next thing I know, my son takes the car and goes to McDonald's with my daughter, leaving me home alone.
My family went to McDonald's, and they didn't invite me. I was left home alone, and I had to make do with a rubbery ham and cheese sandwich because my wife didn't go to the supermarket, and there was no bread. I feel like they should've asked me if I wanted to come, especially since it's my car and my money.
After a full day of work, I end up with a dried out ham and cheese English muffin with no mustard. I feel pressured at work and I didn't enjoy it. It makes me feel taken advantage of.
It's becoming difficult to communicate with my partner. Whenever I try to discuss the problem of me going back to school, she becomes very angry and starts yelling at me. She says it's my problem and I should go to therapy.
I am Edward Crane, and my issue is that I have a problem with my wife's behavior. I think it would be nice if I could fix her and her problem, as it's affecting our family. We have two children; our son is a senior in high school and is currently looking into colleges.
I have a good relationship with my kids, but lately I feel overwhelmed. My son is always taking the car when I come home, and I have to chauffeur my daughter around. We eat together at night, but they just disappear as soon as we're done. I am trying to be a supportive parent, but it's draining.
I feel like my family doesn't need me anymore. They have their own lives and friends that are more important. The other day, I got a note to fix dinner for the kids, so I wanted to order pizza.
I usually stay at home feeling bad and alone, but I understand that it would be better to do something enjoyable instead. I am willing to try and choose to do these activities to see if it helps me feel better. However, I am still concerned about how this might affect my relationship with Sharon.
I worry that if I do something alone, it's going to be terrible. I feel like it won't change anything for Sharon.
I had a great week. Sharon came back from the conference and we had a nice week together. She has been really nice.
I'm the patient and I just wanted to share that my partner and I haven't been having any arguments lately, and our relationship has been pretty good.
I've been feeling very angry and needy lately, and it's making me upset that I feel like I need to be taken care of all the time. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way, and it's making me feel very dependent on others.
I've always been taken care of by my family members, and they have done everything for me. As a result, I never learned to be independent and struggle with basic tasks like walking too far or riding a bicycle. I feel like I wasn't competent enough to do anything, and my mother constantly called me in college as if I couldn't take care of myself.
When I was in high school, my mom would always pick out my clothes for me. Even when I tried to pick my own clothes or told her not to do it, she would make me change if she didn't like what I was wearing. Ultimately, I just found it easier not to argue about it. The message I got from this was that I couldn't do it myself, so she had to do it for me.
I've noticed that when I accepted the fact that someone was leaving and there was nothing I could do about it, I eventually felt better about the situation. Additionally, I've also started doing more things for myself, like going to the movies.
I've been working on myself and doing well in activities like bowling. I've also learned about identifying evidence, like when I thought I was going to lose my job but realized the facts supported me keeping it. I now understand that situations aren't feelings, feelings aren't thoughts, and thoughts aren't situations. I'm using the dysfunctional thoughts record to examine what affects my feelings and how I can change them so I don't feel bad.
I've learned how to not upset myself so much by using various tools and as a result, I think I'm feeling better.
As the patient, I have one question before our time is up.
I feel like if I'm eating alone, people might think I'm a loser. But if someone else does the same, like you, I might think they're an important person.
I'm feeling worried about doing activities alone, like having a Chinese dinner, going to a movie, and bowling. I've never done that before and I'm concerned that if I make a plan, I might feel too depressed to follow through with it.
I've been having some issues, and I'm worried that therapy might take years and years. I'd like to know what you can do for me and if there's a specific plan or timeline we could follow.
I have been feeling down, sad, and depressed lately, and it's affecting my daily life. I am willing to participate in therapy sessions and fill out the Beck Inventory form to monitor my feelings and identify any problems that affect me more keenly at different times.
I've been attending therapy sessions, and my therapist mentioned cognitive therapy, but I'm not exactly sure what that means. I understand the term 'cognitive' is related to thinking, though.
I am sad, angry, and depressed because my friend told me that she's going to the movies with others and they don't want me to come along. I feel abandoned.
I feel like I'm being abandoned because my partner is going to a conference, and it's not fair. I don't think I'm being treated fairly in this situation.
I am worried because my wife is going to start attending a lot of conferences, and I will be left alone. This situation makes me feel sad and depressed.
I'm really upset because my wife and I have never been apart for 21 years, and now she's going to be away for a couple of nights.
This is the first time my wife is choosing to be away on her own for a conference, and I am worried that she might start attending conferences more frequently and be away from home all the time.
I'm concerned because my wife said she's going to a conference, and I feel left out. I was initially upset, but then I had a good idea to ask if I can go with her and take a couple of days off work.
I suggested to my wife, Sharon, that we could go to the conference together and enjoy a nice weekend. I thought it was a great idea. But, she didn't like the idea at all and said that she and the girls have made plans together and they don't include me.
I feel like people are taking advantage of me and it makes me feel down. This leads to me feeling depressed and lacking the energy to do anything.
I feel abandoned. My wife is going off and leaving me, my kids are also going away. My son will be in college next year and I think I will never hear from him again. I'm going to be left all by myself, and it's not the way I expected my marriage to turn out.
I've been struggling with marital problems, work concerns, sleep issues, anger, sadness, and feeling down. I just had a 40-minute session where we identified these problems. The counsellor suggested 10 more sessions, which sounds like a lot to me.
I used to enjoy bowling, but I don't do it anymore because my partner, Sharon, doesn't like it. We rarely go to movies as we never agree on what to watch. I can go to a restaurant for dinner, but I don't like to sit alone there.
I just don't like to sit alone in a restaurant. I mean, you know, what will people think? This is the third session I've been here and I still don't understand what you're going to do for me. When I'm alone in a restaurant, I feel depressed, like 85-90 out of 100. I'd be feeling like the poor loser there, sitting there all by himself, with nobody loving him or having a family.
I feel like a loser because I have no family and nobody loves me. I think others must look at me and think the same, like when I see someone eating alone in a restaurant and I pity them.
I would feel different because I knew that I, I wouldn't be going to the job that I've been going to for the past three months. I would be living in a cooler place with my wife, doing something completely different, something that I would enjoy doing. I would feel much more relaxed and much more at peace with myself, and probably everybody else, including my wife.
I've been feeling discomfort in my current job and would really love to work full-time on the radio, something I've enjoyed for a long time. Currently, I do this one day a week and it involves interviews, discussing local issues, talking to local people and helping the community sector promote their activities. This is what I'd love to do five days a week.
I recently moved to a new place with my wife, and we are both adjusting to the changes in our life.
I have been feeling discomfort within my current job for the past three months. I initially thought it was something I would enjoy, but as time has passed, I've felt less and less comfortable. I'm unsure if the job is right for me, but I do like my coworkers and the overall atmosphere. The work itself isn't the problem, but I can't pinpoint the reason for my discomfort.
Last Friday, I felt like running out of the place screaming, absolutely screaming. It just seemed that there was a lot of demands being made on me in a very short time and it just got to me and I thought I can't do this; but it was crazy because I can do it. But, again, there's this confusion, am I in the right place, am I doing something that I really want to do or is this something else and I just got tired of it.
I usually pick a place that's air conditioned. It's more just being able to be outside and move around freely, feeling more comfortable in myself. On a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of how much this applies to me, I'd say I'm an 8.
I feel like the impulse is there, and I am willing to make an effort towards achieving my miracle. My willingness to work on it is about a seven out of ten, which is still pretty high. I think when I was offered the opportunity to work on it, my motivation increased.
I'm considering making a big move to another part of Australia with my wife and I need to ensure we're on the same wavelength before making the decision. I plan to do some research, look for places in Australia with cooler climates and without humidity, and talk to some friends who have lived in different parts.
I am currently struggling with the heat and humidity where I'm living, and it's becoming a challenge for me. I've experienced cooler climates before, like when I visited my brother in Tasmania and when I lived in Scotland for 10 years, and found them more comfortable.
I've experienced living in different climates, and I found that I had more energy in a cooler climate. I didn't feel restricted and found myself doing more things. But in warmer climates, I now restrict myself to being in air-conditioned or cooler places.
I used to enjoy being outdoors and active when I lived in Scotland, but now that I'm living in a different climate, the hot weather on weekends makes me lose the inclination to go outside. I miss having that energy and enjoying the outdoors.
Although I feel more social, it's not necessarily caused by the environment. I can still be social if I go to someone else's place or meet someone at a coffee shop or a restaurant, as those places are usually air-conditioned.
I recently returned from overseas and I am trying to figure out what I want to do now in Australia. My brother, who lives in Tasmania, has been helpful by sending me information about real estate prices and other local details.
I feel like today's session has been helpful for me. It has helped me verbalize my thoughts and imagine the bigger picture I hadn't considered before. I can now see what it might look like and the talking I need to do. I think I have some positive moves to make after this session.
I had a counseling session, and by the end of it, I was feeling better. The counsellor mentioned the possibility of making another appointment in the future to see how I have been going. What should I do?
It's just like when is it -- when is it just going to stop. I don't know really. Um, will I ever be all right. I don't know. Yeah. I thought that – that kind of threw me. I don't – is it it, is it me. Is it -- What is it, yeah. What -- Yeah. I don't even know what it is.
I just wished my life was different. I wonder if my mom never died or if my brothers didn't introduce me to drugs, would my life be better? I'm not in prison and not committing crimes anymore, but I still don't feel alright. I am trying to understand why I still feel this way.
Recently, I've realized that ever since I came here, I haven't tried to fix things by running around and resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms like fancying everyone I see or eating a lot of chocolate.
I've been feeling not normal, and it will take me a week to feel normal again. I have an appointment scheduled next week with my counsellor, but I'm not sure if it's the same time and if they'll be there.
I have stopped taking drugs, and my life has gotten better in some ways. But, it's still really hard, and I thought things would be easier by now. I feel stuck, like I don't know what to do or how to live a normal life. I am in constant turmoil, and I find it challenging to settle and feel at ease.
I find myself constantly wishing and fantasizing about finding something meaningful in my life, but when I'm with others, I just pretend that everything is fine.
I don't know why I came here, but I guess I'm just looking for answers that I'm not getting. How many more times do I need to see you?
I feel overwhelmed with our previous discussion about failures and hurt, and the whole situation seems too hard to handle right now. Do I have the answers?
I stopped using drugs, but I thought my life would be better after that. It's really hard, though. I don't know what to do. I go through the day, but it's not easy. I feel stuck and there's a constant turmoil.
I feel like I've constantly got to do things, and I can never just sit down and relax. I always have to clean up or talk to someone. I just want to know when it's going to stop and if I'll ever be alright.
I have taken care of myself and I'm considering ending the therapy. But I'm also feeling strange about the idea of continuing to work with you. It's kind of mad, isn't it?
Lately, I've been feeling a mix of emotions - I like something, but I don't at the same time and I can't explain it. I've noticed a bit of warmth and I've stopped running around trying to fix things. I'm no longer attracted to everyone I see, indulging in chocolate, or seeking comfort in different ways.
I feel like I need to be special to feel normal, but now I've got to wait a week to feel that normal again. Should I come the same time next week?
I haven't mentioned any specific issue or concern, but I just wanted to let you know that I'll be available for the session and I'm looking forward to getting some help.
I don't think I know how to take care of myself. It's difficult for me because I've never been taught or seen it done, and it just seems too much for me.
I have been through too much, and even simple tasks like making a packed lunch seem like hard work to me. It sounds silly, but I feel like I can handle the tougher and darker aspects of life like prison and drugs, because I know how to suffer and survive.
I've been struggling to survive, and the thought of this being life feels strange. However, I noticed that the hole in my heart seems to be a little bit gone for a minute when someone listened to me. I don't think anyone has really listened to me before.
I don't know how to look after myself and it's all new to me. I feel vulnerable and worry about going back into the world where people ask how I'm doing.
I have been pretending that everything is all right, but deep down, I still feel scared and lonely. I have been to prison many times, and I am tough, but this recovery process has surprised me. I didn't know what it was like to be lonely or scared, but I just realized that I felt like that as a child.
I've recently given up drugs, but now I can't stop thinking about this story of the little match girl. When she lights a match, she sees everything she's ever wanted, just like how I saw a better life without drugs. But now it's gone, just like the match flame, and I don't know what to do.
I feel like some part of me has had enough, and I came here looking for answers, but it seems like a different part of me is speaking now and it's almost like the situation is closed.
I'm worried that this is just going to be another way to die. I feel like I come here with expectations, and I'm afraid of being let down again by yet another person. It's frustrating.
I feel really upset and frustrated with life. I'm not even sure if I'm angry at you, but I'm just mad at everything. I wish things were different. I've always wanted to be special - to receive love and attention. I remember seeing other parents showing affection to their kids at school, and I wished for that too.
I don't know if I'm pissed off with you. I don't even know you enough to be pissed with you really. I'm just pissed off of it all really. With myself, with life. I just wished it was different. I would have liked to have been special, to been shown some love and attention. I remember being at school and feeling envious of other kids who had their moms drop them off and say good night. Even though my mom passed away, I wanted it to be like that, but it wasn't. And now I can make up how I want it to happen because I know I'll never have it.
I have this fantasy where I just want to feel that I'm special and loved by someone who comes to my school, makes me a pack lunch, and takes care of me like I'm a child again. I know it's not realistic, but I can't seem to let go of it.
I was by myself and felt quite lonely. There was someone who was actually quite frightening and I think that's how I felt at the time.
I'm looking for comfort and ease in my life, and I wish someone would take care of me and make me feel special. I even want someone to make me a packed lunch. But it sounds quite silly when I say it out loud.
I am feeling angry because I realize that I can't have the childhood I wanted with a nice uniform, clean clothes, and a family to say goodbye every morning. I can't help but think of the what ifs and compare myself to the other girls at school, wondering if they had a normal life.
I used to live a chaotic life, filled with crack houses, being beaten up, fighting, and going to prison. It all seemed normal to me, but now I realize how awful it sounds. I just want to be normal now, have a packed lunch, go to work, and have someone to look after me and a pet dog.
Lately, I have been struggling with making decisions, even simple ones like choosing sandwich fillings. I managed to get a bit of bread and chose a filling, but it took me a long time and caused a lot of stress.
It kind of helped me, that there's something that will hold me for a little while. But the fantasy was that I'd stop using and everything would be okay. Instead, everything that held me together is gone, and what's horrible is that what was holding me together was killing me.
I feel lost like I don't know where I've gone, and I'm wondering how long we have left in our session.
I am struggling with my problems and I came here looking for answers, but it feels like I'm not getting any solutions from you. What is supposed to happen? Is this just going to be another way to die?
I feel like I could handle a difficult life because I know how to survive, but I'm just learning how to live.
I don't know if anyone has ever really listened to me before, even though I'm struggling with the thought of this being my life.
As a patient, I want to continue coming to the sessions, but I have mixed feelings about it. I like coming, but at the same time, I don't. It's hard for me to explain this feeling.
Lately, I have been struggling because it feels like the happiness I once had is gone, and it's too late to get it back. I constantly find myself thinking about 'what if' scenarios and wondering how my life could have been different.
I want to be normal. I just want to be normal. And have me packed lunch and go to work and someone to look after me...
I don't think I know how to take care of myself, and it seems hard just to make a packed lunch or buy a bit of bread.
I feel envious of others' relationships with their mothers, because mine has never been like that. I know I'll never have the connection I want with her, so I create a fantasy where everything is okay and she loves me. I'm having trouble letting go of that fantasy, even though I know it's not real.
I just wanted to feel loved, really. When I was by myself, it was quite frightening, and I felt lonely and scared. But I still pretend everything's fine.
I've been through a lot in my life, including going to prison multiple times, and I consider myself to be a tough person. But recently, I've been going through some emotional recovery, and it has left me feeling lonely and scared, reminding me of how I felt as a child. I never realized that I felt this way before.
I had an opportunity to move to LA in the past, but I didn't take it because I wanted to finish school first. Now that I've finished, I have another opportunity to move there, and I'm struggling with the decision. The thought of regret and 'what if' keeps coming up, making me question if I should just go with it and move to LA.
I am struggling with the decision to move to LA because of the strong connections I've made in San Diego, including close friendships that feel like family and the hard work I've put in here. I also have family in San Diego, including a niece, and I'm worried about losing the connection with her if I move.
I feel like it's time for me to transition and follow ahead with my plans, but I wish it was easier to just close the door on the decision and focus single-mindedly on doing it.
I've been feeling overwhelmed with a big decision I need to make and I've been struggling with the pressure from external factors. I want to find a way to take some pressure off and make this decision about me. One thing that I think would help is discussing it more with my friends, being more honest about where I'm at, and involving them in the process.
I'm struggling with making a decision about whether to move or stay, because it's affecting my relationships with my partner who lives in a different city, and my other relationships. I'm feeling stuck because either decision would require me to prioritize my partner's relationship over others.
I've been discussing my various options with my therapist, and I've decided that I want to slow things down and give myself more time to make a decision. I want to find the best outcome that will make me happy and allow me to be who I truly am.
I don't like the way my husband and brother are treating me, but I'm grateful I can take care of myself. I've dealt with situations I didn't like before and I'll do it again.
As a patient, I want to be able to make a decision without being clouded by anger, vindictiveness and hurt. Instead, I want to approach it from a more rational perspective.
I overheard my husband and brother talking behind my back, and it seemed like they were planning something that might exclude me. I felt anxious, angry, betrayed, and depressed. I confronted them on the phone and asked if I should be a part of the conversation. My brother responded with a lie about talking about trivial matters.
I felt really angry when I found out that I was being excluded from a gathering. My heart was beating fast, and I had thoughts about confronting them but decided not to escalate the situation and just said I'll see them later.
When I was feeling really upset about being excluded, some of my thoughts included feeling like I don't belong and that no one wants me around. It made me question my worth and self-esteem.
I'm really angry. I got mad at my husband and my brother last week when I overheard my husband saying to my brother that he's just been agreeing with everything I say for the last two months to avoid conflict. I feel hurt, like my feelings are being dismissed, and I'm not sure how to handle this situation.
I felt very angry when my husband mentioned that he had put some money away and told my brother about it, but not me. We've been together for 38 years and it makes me feel betrayed.
I feel betrayed, like I don't have any friends here. After that, I felt depressed and experienced anxiety. These are significant people in my life.
I was feeling angry, anxious, and betrayed. I couldn't understand why these people would show respect for each other but not for me. I think a man should tell his wife about things, not his brother-in-law.
I feel like my partner should understand my needs, and if he doesn't, we will both be losers, our relationship will suffer, and we may eventually stop communicating or even split up after 38 years together.
I feel so angry and betrayed because my husband excluded me from financial planning, and I think it's related to my childhood when my parents divorced, and I had a stepdad I couldn't stand.
As the patient, I feel disappointed and I'm really pissed about my current situation.
I am feeling upset because my husband has hidden financial information from me and made rude comments about treating me with kid gloves. My brother has also been colluding with him, making me feel even more betrayed.
I feel really hurt when my husband and brother patronize and collude against me. It makes me feel depressed and betrayed.
I recently attended an Albert Ellis workshop, and while I believe his theories intellectually, I am not sure if I have fully grasped them emotionally. I want to remember the coping statements, but I don't know if I will be able to use them effectively when I face triggering situations.
I tend to ruminate on my anger, but my mother knows how to handle my father's anger problems much better than I do. She doesn't dwell on it like I do. How can I learn to deal with my anger like my mother?
I can see my mom sometimes building up anger when dealing with my father on certain issues. She gets a particular look in her eye and walks away for a bit. Then, she comes back to handle the situation after she and my dad have calmed down.
I tend to get angry, not as bad as my dad, but people say I'm more like him. I'd love to be able to manage my anger like my mom does.
When I run into Robert at the supermarket, I tend to experience ruminative anger, which makes it difficult for me to confront him appropriately. I'd like to learn how to have a lower level of anger, similar to my mom, so that I can effectively communicate my feelings with Robert. Can you help me understand what triggers the transition from lower level anger to rumination and how I can prevent that?
I have been waiting for an apology from a person, Robert, who I believe owes me one. In the past, I would see him and think that he owes it to me, and I would get upset when he doesn't apologize. After reflecting on our past interactions, I realize the chances of him apologizing are slim based on his previous behavior.
I wouldn't expect an apology from him, but I might still want it. Despite his wrongdoings, he's a nice guy and could be an okay acquaintance. I think focusing on the conversation might help me feel more pleasant.
I've been struggling with a need to be perfect all the time. I want to adopt a more relaxed way of thinking, specifically when dealing with my friend Robert.
I often expect apologies from people when they treat me badly, but I rarely get them. I think it's because the situations are insignificant to them, but they should be more significant. I'm a perfectionist and I don't want to lower my standards. How can I accept that I can't control people and their apologies?
I don't think I'd be able to lower my standards of what I want from people because I take pride in how I am and how I hold myself. The probability of people behaving according to my standards is not very high. I've been this way for 40 years, so changing what I want could be too difficult.
I feel like I can't change my desires and the way I want things, and I think it's because of the way I was brought up.
I still get upset when I run into my ex-boyfriend in the neighborhood. He doesn't get what he did to me when we were together, and he didn't treat me right. He never apologized for his actions and I feel like I deserve an apology for what he put me through.
I've been really upset since I saw my ex three days ago. He acted like nothing was wrong and even flirted with me. It takes me a long time to get over these encounters, and I keep ruminating on all the bad things he did during our relationship. In the past few days, I haven't wanted to go out or deal with people, and I'm struggling to focus at work.
I can't focus, and I don't want to be angry, but it's not my fault. I'm not choosing to be angry.
I'm really not happy with the way we've left things in the past, and I really don't have anything to say to you. I'm busy and need to go. I tried expressing myself in a more controlled way, and it felt freeing.
As a patient, I used to be really angry and would just wait for the right thing to happen, but since I got my anger under control, I feel a lot calmer and more in control of my emotions. Recently, I had an interaction with someone I had unresolved issues with, and I calmly told him that I didn't want to talk to him right now and wished him a nice day. I feel lighter and freer.
I think I have to stay clear that I don't want to just stay there and talk to him. I want to focus on how to get out before he gets me riled up. I guess I could practice in a mirror or practice the imagery that we did here.
I'm struggling with unresolved feelings towards my relationship with Robert, and I've found that my anger has only led to wasted time. I want to express my feelings to him, but I haven't found a productive way to do so.
I have been writing detailed letters to people, assuming they have the courtesy to read them. These letters are quite long and take me at least a day or two to complete. Is it worth spending that much time on these letters?
I guess not. Like, it's just been my way of dealing, like, to kind of, in explicit detail, kind of outline how I'm feeling. I just, I want him to, you know, apologize for the way it ended. I, you know, I think it was more his issue.
I'm feeling really upset about my ex-boyfriend who has done something again that bothers me. I'm seething with anger and can't get my mind off of him.
I was at the supermarket in my neighborhood when my ex-boyfriend, who I haven't spoken to in nine months, bumped into me and started engaging me in conversation. The whole time I didn't want to talk to him because he owes me an apology for everything that he's done.
Throughout my relationship with my ex, who comes from a better part of Eastern Europe, I constantly felt that he was condescending towards me. It was a subtle way of talking and sometimes even his tone that made me feel this way. I can't provide specific examples, but I just know it was there.
I'm struggling because I keep thinking about all the things my ex-partner did wrong, and it's distracting me from moving on. I know it doesn't help, but it's hard to let go of that inventory of bad deeds.
I've been trying to change my bad deeds, but it doesn't seem to work. I feel like I'm wasting so much time on it.
I have been feeling really upset for the past three days. I keep seeing my partner in my mind and I can't stop ruminating about the situation. I have been doing this over and over again, maybe even a couple hundred times in those three days.
I guess I didn't think of it as practicing, but I did sort of practice the same response over and over rather than trying a new one. Dr. Ray suggested that we make some time during our sessions and then I could practice the new response each day. There are a lot of people I get angry at, so I wonder if this same strategy might help me with other people as well.
I, I have some coworkers that, just brought up wrong. Definitely rude and impolite, and just their work ethic, and sometimes, we, we don't even have, often work together, it's just when I see them working on their projects, it just kind of gets me angry that they don't put enough into it.
I recently had an interaction with someone that made me angry, and I ended up talking to them longer than I wanted to. When I get angry, I often do things that I don't want to do. In this case, I didn't even think about walking away and telling the person that I had something better to do.
I tend to wait for people to rectify situations that bother me rather than speaking up about it. I feel like I'm giving them a favor by waiting for an apology, but it doesn't always happen.
I have been waiting for an apology from someone who treated me badly, but I've never told them that. Instead, I often remain silent when thinking about confronting them.
I come from Eastern Europe and was raised with certain manners and politeness that I find lacking in New York City. This angers me, and it's interfering with my life here. I also seem to attract low-quality people and want to work on this issue in therapy.
I have low-quality friends and people in my life, and I need to find a way to screen those people out. I tried deep breathing to reduce my anger, but it hasn't worked. I don't know what else to do.
I'm struggling with anger because I feel like the problem would be solved if this person apologized to me, but they haven't. I don't need to be angry if he would just do what he's supposed to do. I don't know how to get past this.
I am angry about an incident at the supermarket, and it has been bothering me for the last three or four days. The person involved was flirting with me, and I think they should apologize. I didn't ask for an apology or indicate that I was upset during the conversation because I felt it would be inappropriate. I believe they should call me and set aside an appropriate time to apologize.
I had a conversation with someone I had issues with, and I was hoping for an apology. We talked for about five or ten minutes, but I didn't feel good about spending that much time with him since he didn't apologize.
I run into this guy who I get angry at every couple of weeks. There are a lot of incompetent people out there, and when I encounter them, I lose control of my anger, and it interferes with my day.
I feel angry that he can go around being rude, and I haven't done a very good job of keeping him in line. I know with Robert, I don't really want him in my life, so I think it would be a better way to handle him.
I've been trying to give up control over my ex-partner Robert and focus on controlling myself. I still get angry when I hear his voice, but I've been practicing telling myself that I can't control him and that I can't get what I want from him. I've noticed that the initial anger isn't as intense when I do this, but I still need to work on it.
I've been rehearsing some thoughts and it makes me feel calmer. However, there's still an initial thought that I want him to apologize, but I think it's more about letting it go now.
I could feel him getting angry, and I just know he hasn't done it before. So why get angry now? It hasn't helped. I'm just imagining looking into his eyes and knowing that he's not gonna apologize. I think I get angry at him, also, for making me angry for four days afterward.
I felt closer to my mom's anger after the session than I did before. I wasn't totally calm, but I was more in control and felt less tense when I accepted the fact that I won't get the apology I really wanted.
I used to try to control my partner's behavior, but now I've given up on that and focused on controlling myself instead. However, I still worry about my partner continuing his poor manners and disrespectful behavior.
I missed a party at work because I didn't want to face people, and I think I would've had a good time. I wasn't as productive and I couldn't sleep. I found myself having a hard time falling asleep at night. When I couldn't sleep, I was more irritable and less effective.
I've been struggling with anger lately and it's not helping me at all. When people wrong me, I can't help but focus on the negative and it's consuming my time and energy.
I don't know if I can feel neutral when I bump into my ex next time. He seems to know how to push my buttons.
I have been in a relationship for a year, and for the last ten months, I have been expecting apologies from my partner at least once a week. However, I never got them, and that's why we ended up breaking up.
I am upset because Robert has wronged me about 50 times, but he has only apologized two or three times. I still expect and want an apology, even though he hasn't given me one most of the time.
I'm struggling with the expectation that someone should apologize to me, even though it's not based on reality, but rather on my own desires.
I often find myself getting angry when interacting with someone, and it feels like I'm replaying past events in my head. For example, recently I've been upset at someone at the deli for messing up my sandwich repeatedly. I start thinking about all the previous times they've screwed up, and it makes me even angrier. I just want them to rectify the situation.
I feel wronged by certain people, and I want an apology or some sort of rectifying situation. However, based on my past experiences, the likelihood of receiving that apology is not very good.
I'm waiting for an apology from my ex-partner, Robert, after our breakup. We have interacted maybe eight times since the breakup and he still hasn't apologized.
As a patient, I saw someone a couple of times a week, and at least once a week, I expected an apology that I never received.
I've been angry at someone and wrote letters to express my feelings, but it never got me an apology. I'm considering talking to the person to ask for an apology.
I feel upset because he didn't apologize for his past actions. I know I should get over it, but it's difficult for me not to think about it.
I've been feeling angry because someone I encountered didn't apologize for their rude behavior. It's frustrating that I can't control their actions, but it got me thinking about the amount of energy and emotions I've invested in this brief encounter for the past three days.
I know it sounds stupid, but I'd almost have to practice. Like, I couldn't even imagine myself just being taken off guard. I'd almost need help, but I guess it's impossible, I don't know.
I tried using the new way of thinking, as per your suggestion, in a situation that usually makes me angry. I imagined being in a supermarket, heard a voice that usually triggers my anger, and tried to let go of that anger. I'd like him to apologize, but I'm trying to accept this is who he is.
I haven't had a chance to read much of the book because I've been really busy. I only managed to read the introduction, and I can't promise that I'll be able to put more time aside for it.
I finally had some time to fill out the form you gave me, and as I was doing it, I couldn't help but wonder what Jill wrote on hers.
As a patient, I filled out a questionnaire and mentioned that even if my partner starts acting more positively, it's their attitude that is causing the problem. I also believe that it's not fair for me to change.
So, I just try to do that on my own or…
I'm hesitant to attend the therapy session with my partner, because I feel that if we can't work out our issues ourselves, having someone else tell us what to do won't solve the problem.
I've been feeling down lately, but I really hope to see improvements soon.
I feel like I need to gain independence from her before anything happens. I want to be independent before anything forces me into having to be responsible. I'm trying to get more independent, but everyone tells me different things, and it's like another burden. I'm having a hard time figuring it out on my own.
I feel overwhelmed because I have so much input from everybody else about which path I should take in life. There are ten people telling me to take ten different paths, and I don't know what to do.
I'm feeling pretty confused. My sister suggested that I should move out of state to gain independence, but I don't think that's right for me right now. I'm trying to decide if I should get a car or a place first.
As a patient, I feel unsure about my situation and say, 'Um, yeah I guess it does.'
I've been having thoughts like, 'If I lose my mom before I get my independence, I won't make it.' These thoughts make me feel really anxious and sad.
Today, I learned about writing down the advantages and disadvantages before making a decision, and I think it will help me with other decisions as well.
I've been struggling with making decisions lately. I find it hard to weigh the pros and cons of different options in my head. Can you help me with this?
I'm worried about ending up in that old room again.
I had this fantasy that was bothering me, but now I am trying to improve it in a way that makes me feel better. I have started thinking of having pictures on the wall, nice furniture, and kids on the bed. This makes me feel better and I realize that the house is full.
I grew up in a full house with lots of family around all the time. As a result, I find it scary to be alone in a room since I'm used to having my eight older brothers and sisters around.
I'm worried about my future, especially if my mom isn't around. She's really important to me and I've experienced several losses in my life already. I might not make it without her.
I've been realizing that my thoughts are affecting how I feel and that when I'm depressed, my thoughts are often negative or scared, and I usually believe them without questioning their validity.
I am struggling with finding out which of my thoughts are true and which ones aren't. If they are true, I know I need to solve a problem, but if they're not, I'm not sure what to do. Can you help me figure out how to differentiate between these thoughts?
I'm feeling anxious about the thought of losing my mother one day. She seems healthy now, but I know it's inevitable that parents usually die before their children. My thoughts often drift towards this worry when she criticizes me about something as simple as paper towels. I think about whether I might lose her soon or in 20-30 years.
I'm worried that I might lose someone important to me very soon, but I don't have any evidence to support this fear.
I am dealing with a housing problem, struggling with coping better with my mother, especially when she's grieving and I get scared and unsure. Additionally, I feel burdened by my role as a parent and obligated to my mom.
I feel like I am constantly being compared to my siblings, as I still live with my mother while they have moved on with their lives. This makes me feel judged by my family, especially because I am supposed to meet their expectations. Lately, I have been struggling a lot with dealing with grief related to my mother.
I feel overwhelmed by all these problems piling on my shoulders. But when asked to choose one to focus on, I sighed in relief and felt a bit more hopeful.
Well, um, my mom, I mean she has helped me a lot and she has done so much for me, but I feel sometimes when, like sometimes she's just, and so it, I have to deal with that day to day I don't know what each day is going to be like. And I know they're all different, but it's like, I don't.
Sometimes it's like, I'm just wishing that things would get better. I feel so burdened by so many things, especially being a parent.
As a mom, I find it really tough and feel burdened by my responsibilities towards my kids and my mother who is moving into her senior years. I come from a large family, and I have expectations like finishing college that I need to meet, but sometimes it's not easy.
I think my mother was a great mother to us with 11 children. I can see the vast difference between us, and I would like to be more like her in a sense of being a parent. She was a homemaker, while I work part-time as a cashier and am a full-time student.
I feel like if I don't gain my independence right now, I won't be able to make it in the future. It feels like I need to prove to her that I can make it.
I want independence so badly, and I've been looking at apartments. At first, I was confused about what to do next, but after talking for a bit, I felt more clear about my next steps.
I feel like my depression and fears are holding me back, but I'm still trying to move forward by doing things like looking for apartments and trying to improve my life.
I want to be stronger and independent. I feel so sad and burdened, but I really do want to be stronger. Sometimes I feel sad and anxious because of thoughts that I have.
I used to be more confident in myself, but now I'm struggling to find that self-confidence. I have some emotional support from my sisters, but I still feel like I need to learn how to better support myself.
I feel it's going to be more difficult financially without my mom's support, and I'm worried about my kids. We were out looking for a place and it was hard.
As a patient, I'm struggling to find a new place for my family and me after staying at my grandma's place. I have three kids aged nine, seven, and three. I need advice on how to make the search for a new home more positive for my kids.
I'm worried that if I don't have my independence first before I lose my mom, I might not make it. But if I had my independence now, I would feel a lot more secure.
I have been feeling severely depressed since December of 1996, when I lost my brother.
I was just starting to do a lot of erratic things, like getting arrested and convicted for the delivery of a controlled substance, and it has completely changed my life. I have been feeling depressed.
I've been feeling depressed ever since my father passed away over a year ago. I work part-time and have two or three children. I was finally ready to get out on my own and raise them in my own household, but I've been struggling to cope with living with my mother.
I've been struggling with ongoing grief over my father and brother's death. It comes and goes, and it's hard to cope with, especially since my mother is grieving too.
I was evaluated by a counsellor and my score on the depression indicator was 41, which falls in the severe range. I am really quite depressed and the counsellor mentioned that it's helpful for them to know my score as it helps them understand my condition better.
I have been feeling severely depressed since December 1996 when I lost my brother. Since then, I started doing a lot of erratic things that I thought were erratic.
I was arrested and convicted for delivery of controlled substances. This changed my life a whole lot and I became depressed.
I think I've been depressed ever since a certain incident happened.
I am worried that I might not make it, especially if my mom is not around. She's very important to me, and I've already had several losses. I feel like I need to gain independence from her.
I want to be independent before anything happens to my mother, but I'm finding it difficult as everyone is giving me different advice on what I should do first. This has become another burden, and now I don't have a clue on how to proceed.
I am unsure of the best course of action for my situation. My one sister suggests that I should get a car first, while my other sister recommends something else. I feel confused about which path to choose.
I felt okay during our conversation tonight. There was nothing you said that I thought you misunderstood, and nothing really bothered me. But, there was something specific on my mind that we might have talked about.
As a patient, I was discussing the idea of writing down the advantages and disadvantages of a situation. It's something that I find interesting, and I believe this approach will help me make better decisions in the future.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and stressed in my personal life, and I struggle to cope with it.
As the patient, I believe that if I'm an independent person it will be easier, if I'm not it will be harder, but not impossible. I believe it a lot. I want to believe this and I really want to believe this. However, sometimes I'm not sure if I fully believe it.
As a patient, I am worried about my support system after my mom passes away. She helps me a lot now by babysitting and providing emotional support. I have sisters, but none of them can help me the way my mom does.
I'm worried about losing my mom because I rely on her for so many things, like financial support and babysitting. I'm not sure what I would do without her and if it would be possible to get these things from other people.
I'm worried about finding someone to babysit my kids when I need some time for myself. It might be hard, but it's not impossible.
I was feeling okay, but when I was preparing to leave for school, my mother had a bad day and started criticizing me over a minor thing like leaving a paper towel out. I ended up feeling emotionally sad, scared, and unsure.
I felt upset when my mom criticized me for leaving paper towels out. I thought that if I was a mom, I wouldn't have to listen to her criticizing me about this. If I were in my own place, I wouldn't have to listen to this.
I just thought about my mother and how much she missed my father. It never really dawned on me, until now, how much she could be missing him and feeling lonely. I felt really sad when I realized this.
I thought that, just seeing her, just seeing she seems so different now. She just, she seemed real, real sure patient now, and what made me scared is just the thought of losing her and just the thought of if I was wondering, 'Okay, if I, if my dad l-, when my dad died I lost, I feel like I lost a lot of things. I don't know.' Seems like things just started to go away, I don't, and with her I feel, I was just scared that I don't know, I'm, I'm just in a, I just feel scared.
I feel burdened with my current job, but I like the people I work with. I want a better position, but I think I need to improve my skills first.
I don't really have many friends right now, just one or two. One of them has been a good friend for a while, but I think I'm okay with that. I'm also dealing with a housing problem and coping with my mother, especially when she's feeling a lot of grief.
I feel a lot of pressure in my life, mainly because of my family's expectations and feeling obligated to my mom. I often hear comparisons between me and my siblings, as I'm still living at home. Recently, my mom has been struggling with grief, and I want to learn how to deal with it.
Recently, on Tuesday morning, I experienced something that has been bothering me, and I would like to discuss it with you.
I'm considering moving out sooner to focus more energy on me and my kids. However, I worry about how my sister, who wants me to stay with my mom, will react to my decision.
I'm having some concerns about my sister, who's the oldest of 11 siblings. She has had a lot of responsibility put on her, but she has taken it very well. She understands the advantage of moving. However, my mother doesn't try, and that worries me.
I think the decision to move has been quite difficult for me due to its impact on my family, but I am ready to talk to my sisters who oppose it. However, I have a thought that if I lose my mom before I become independent, I might not make it.
I feel like I need to become independent first before losing my mom. Otherwise, it's going to be really hard for me.
I have thoughts like 'If I lose my mom before I gain my independence, I won't make it', and these thoughts are making me feel really anxious and sad.
When I am feeling really anxious or depressed, I have certain thoughts or pictures that go through my head, and I'm not sure how true they are or how to evaluate them.
I think the important thing we discussed tonight was standing firm on my decision to move and understanding the advantages of moving. It's also about becoming independent before making any big changes in my life.
Lately, I've been having some scary and depressing thoughts, and I tend to worry a lot.
As a patient, I feel like losing my mom means losing a sense of support both financially and emotionally. I feel helpless and inadequate, as if I need her to survive. Recently, I experienced a situation that led to both sad and anxious thoughts and I would like some help understanding them.
I thought that, just seeing her, just seeing she seems so different now. She just, she seemed real, real sure patient now, and what made me scared is just the thought of losing her and just the thought of if I was wondering, 'Okay, if I, if my dad l-, when my dad died I lost, I feel like I lost a lot of things. I don't know.' Seems like things just started to go away, I don't, and with her I feel, I was just scared that I don't know, I'm, I'm just in a, I just feel scared. I feel like that I might loose her, and it scares me a lot.
I'm afraid that I don't know what I'm going to do. That's what I'm afraid of. I don't know. I don't know what would happen to me if I make it.
I recently started to have problems with my memory. It seems worse when I don't get enough sleep. I feel like I'm back in Chicago where I grew up, not doing well. I think part of the reason for my memory issues could be my depression.
I've been feeling more pessimistic, sad, and like a failure lately. I also don't enjoy things as much, feel guilty, have trouble making decisions, and feel more confused. Recently, my mom criticized me for a paper towel issue, and I don't know what to do.
I was feeling sad and scared because of my thoughts when my mom talked to me in a certain way. If I had thought 'how dare she talk to me like that', I would have felt angry, and if I thought 'that's just mom blowing off steam', I might have ended up feeling okay.
I want to believe in myself, but sometimes I'm unsure. My mom is a great support and helps me with tasks like babysitting, but I worry about losing that support as my sisters and I grieve over her eventual passing.
I have been making efforts towards gaining more independence, and I feel like getting my own place will help. However, I'm not sure if I'm ready for this big step.
I had a conversation with my counsellor about feeling confused about what to do next. After discussing it for a minute, I felt clearer about the direction I'm heading in. But I still think that my depression might be holding me back, along with some fears.
I'm actually looking at apartments and doing things to try and make my life better, but I still feel so sad and burdened. I want to be stronger and independent.
I grew up in a not-so-great place, but the view from there used to give me comfort. However, I don't want to physically be there.
Lately, I've been feeling criticized and I'm worried that I might lose someone important in my life. I sometimes have thoughts in the form of pictures, making it hard for me to change the negative thoughts into positive ones. What can I do to feel stronger and move ahead in life?
I am trying to change the picture in my mind by imagining a room with a nice couch, a bed, and family pictures. I would also like to imagine my kids jumping on the bed and having fun.
I am visualizing my furnished room with pictures on the wall, a couch and a bed. I see my three kids jumping on the bed.
I see myself in Chicago, in the area where I grew up, particularly at the house where I grew up.
I find myself back in the room I grew up in, looking out the window at downtown Chicago like I used to do when I was younger. I spent so much time thinking about what I was going to do when I grow up, and now I'm here again.
I used to look out the window and think about all the places I wanted to see and the things I wanted to do. It was comforting and optimistic when I was younger. Now, when I have the same image in my mind, I think 'I might not make it.'
I feel like my life is empty, just like the room I'm in. The only thing that brings light to the room is the view outside the window. But I fear going back to that emptiness.
Lately, I've been feeling like if I engage in a certain activity or thought process, it would be a step back in my progress.
I'm feeling confused about what I want to do in life. My sister suggested moving out of state to experience independence, but I don't think that's right for me.
I'm struggling with making a decision between focusing on getting a car first or moving out first. I feel like if I lose my mom before becoming independent, I might not make it on my own.
I've been struggling with the thought that if I don't become independent before losing my mom, it would be impossible for me to survive without her.
I'm worried about losing my mom because I think I need to be independent first to handle the situation. If I'm not independent, it will be harder for me to cope with her loss, but not impossible. I strongly believe that being independent will make it easier for me to handle her loss.
I feel like I might lose her, and it scares me a lot. I'm afraid that if I lose her, I won't have anybody on my side and then I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know what would happen to me if I make it.
When I think of the future, I feel scared because my loved one might not be there. I don't really see myself anywhere that makes me feel good. I'm not even sure if I see myself in the same place I'm living now.
I don't see myself out on the streets, but I feel like I'm not doing well and I'm unhappy. It's harder for me to cope. I don't want to move back, but I always see myself back in Chicago, where I grew up.
I'm feeling really burdened and not coping well. When my mom criticized me for the paper towel, I felt scared and had this thought that I might not make it. I saw myself back in the place where I grew up, feeling unhappy and not very effective.
I felt pretty good about myself when I was reading in the first grade. We had bears, scavenger hunts, and were given kind of thick books to read, at least, in that level it was kind of thick for first grade.
Recently, I have been experiencing difficulties while learning. Sometimes it's quite challenging, and I feel upset with myself to the point of crying. However, at other times, I find it easy and feel a sense of accomplishment when I finally get things right.
I learned how to read when I was about 4 or 5 years old, earlier than most kids. Everyone in my family was older and always reading a lot, which made me feel left out and frustrated. So, when I finally learned to read, I felt much better. But when I started school, I was in the highest reading group and the lowest math group, although I didn't care much about math.
I remember a moment when I really thought I could read for the first time. I was with my Aunt Telmecida, she was sitting across from me in her nightgown drinking coffee, and I had the book in front of me. I was in my pajamas with fluffy slippers on, and I was on the first page, reading about a little boy and a dog.
I am feeling discomfort because no one's reading yet; they're just sitting there.
Sometimes I am successful in overcoming a problem after a few attempts, and it feels helpful to go back and try again in similar situations. However, I don't always have a lot of patience, and I'm unsure if my patience is helpful when dealing with problems.
I find it difficult to be patient in math but I can be patient in reading and helping others with their problems. When I help others, I feel good about myself and then I go back to my own problems.
I recently realized that a certain pattern of behavior might be helpful for me when I'm on the playground and get a little angry or frustrated.
I don't know how I would, like, talk about this to any, to, to those cops again. Those guys, I don't... I felt like they thought that I was just this dirty girl, you know, who like goes to parties, and then drinks, and then messes with these, you know, like sports players or whatever. They're just gonna judge me you know. And I can't, I can't, I can't take more of that.
It's hard enough already at school, you know, being a woman of color at school like, just trying to get my degree so I can just like, have a job finally. Save some money and all these student loans, like, I can't, I can't afford to be turned into this like, you know, leech or something just trying to bring this guy down or something like that. I don't want them to look at me like that.
I feel weird talking about my emotions and my experience of wanting to punch someone in the face. I've been trying to avoid thinking about it, and instead, I've been going to the gym a lot to distract myself.
I went to the movies three or four times and I've just been doing a lot of things I don't always do. I don't want to be out during the day too much because I don't want to run into him, but I've just been trying to do a lot to keep myself busy and avoid him.
I feel a bit strange and uncomfortable talking about myself the whole time in this session. It's different from usual conversations where we take turns sharing about ourselves.
I am a young woman and I want to talk about my experiences and issues related to being a young woman. I am wondering if you have received proper training to handle such cases?
I've been dealing with a lot of things lately, like college, and it's been really hard for me. My friend suggested that I should talk to someone about it, so I went to my college counseling center and they referred me to you.
I talked to some people at school and they suggested that I should see someone outside because there's a lot going on in my life. I recently went out, met someone, and it didn't go well. I met a guy who wasn't a good person, and it has made things hard for me.
I am struggling to talk about something that I wanted to discuss, and I have only talked about it with one friend. She suggested that I should inform the school, but that's the extent of our conversation. I have never done anything like this before, so I don't really know how to talk to you about it.
I had this guy, you know, at a party, like, force himself on me, so it's been hard. I haven't talked to my family about it because I don't think it's something that they would want to hear about it at all, or I don't know what they would do. I really don't know what they would do.
A few days ago, I had an upsetting experience and I haven't been going out much since then. I don't feel good about it and I haven't seen the person involved. My friend had me go to the police about it, but I really don't want to talk about it.
I don't really even want to deal with it at all. I just feel overwhelmed and came here to talk about what I've been going through.
I experienced something traumatic, but I'm not sure if I want to talk about it a lot. Also, I'm worried about confidentiality.
I don't know what to do. I don't want to study, go outside, or be here. I don't want to go to parties or talk to my friends, and I can't talk to my family about this. I feel like I was used and have no value. The person who hurt me has a good reputation at school, and no one would believe me.
I talked to the police about the incident and wished there had been a female officer there. My friend was there with me for support and pretended to be my sister. I told the police about the person and what they did, but I was embarrassed about having consumed alcohol and worried it would make them think it was my fault.
I don't know if that's what they thought. But they, they wrote it all down and I don't know. I don't know what's supposed to happen now. I mean I don't anything about his, like, connections or whatever. So I don't know if this means that he can be stopped. It's not like I'm gonna write a letter or to the paper or something. So, I don't know what can they do? What can the police do?
I really love my partner and I want to be a good partner for him. He likes to go out a lot and I don't. I prefer staying in, but I am pursuing this change because I don't want to lose my relationship. I'm not sure if I have a problem with not being so social.
I don't think it's me that has a problem. I'm not as social as my partner, and I don't necessarily see it as a problem. However, I'm open to trying something on a smaller scale or something more to do with him.
As a patient, I feel anxious in social situations and I'm not ready to completely change myself into somebody else or do something that I may not be comfortable with yet.
This week, I have been dealing with stomach issues and not feeling great, so I didn't do the homework that we talked about. I want to make changes and deal with my social anxiety, but it seems like something always happens when I'm supposed to do something we discussed.
I've been feeling afraid lately, and I think it might be because I'm scared of not doing things right or not knowing how to do them. I feel like this fear is preventing me from trying new things.
I am afraid that I might fail at being better socially. This is the first time I've said that out loud. I want to change, especially for my boyfriend who has been complaining about my lack of socializing, but I am really scared of not doing it right or failing.
I do want to have less anxiety in some situations but I'm not looking to be someone who goes out all the time and is really talkative. I want to have less anxiety as it doesn't feel good, but I'm also worried about letting you down if I don't agree with you.
I don't want to do that, it doesn't feel good to do that. However, I would like to figure out why I get so anxious in certain situations.
As the patient, I feel that when it comes to being trans and genderqueer, it's about picking your battles. I sometimes wish I had never come out to my mother because it would be easier to pretend with her. I need to see more effort from her before I feel like I can change the way I interact with her.
I'm glad I have the opportunity to talk with you. I try to pick my battles, as I've learned from our conversations over the past few months. I sometimes struggle with my relationships, but I want to improve and learn how to approach certain situations.
As a patient, I feel like I don't use good coping mechanisms for my well-being, and I often feel continually exhausted. While I have established great circles of social support, I still struggle with handling negative feelings.
I feel better with support networks but still struggle with continuous confusion, discrimination, and misunderstanding. I talk to my support networks regularly about specific instances of transphobia or homophobia, but everyday glances or offensive comments don't always come up in conversations with people who have similar experiences.
Sometimes, I find it hard to draw the line between what is worth processing and what is something that I can put aside. I think we all have a mutual understanding of what we are feeling, but I'm not sure if I should always fully process those feelings.
I've been struggling with my family's reaction to my identity. When I notice someone being insensitive, they feel judged and say that I'm not giving them a chance. I feel like I've given them enough chances, but I'm not ready to be vulnerable with them. After a turning point on Thanksgiving, my family became aware of my identity, and they mostly avoid talking to or about me. I think they're nervous about it.
I didn't believe my mom was trying to understand my pronouns and chosen name at first, but now I'm starting to believe her. It originally seemed like she would only use them when talking to me, but not with other people. During Thanksgiving, it felt like a turning point even though everything hasn't improved completely. My whole family is now aware of my identity, but they mostly try not to talk to me or about me.
I felt ignored and invisible when my family would not talk to me about my feelings or ask me any questions. It seemed easier for them to just not acknowledge it and go along with everything else.
I have been okay. I recently came back from a holiday weekend with my family where we did Thanksgiving together. It was an interesting experience because my family dynamic has changed since my mom has started to come around in terms of accepting my gender identity and using my chosen name, Ray.
I have been trying to make my partner understand the importance of using my preferred pronouns and addressing me by my correct name and gender. We've been going back and forth about this for the last year. I initially started off gently, but gradually became more insistent as the issue was seriously compromising our relationship. It seems like my partner is not making any effort to understand and engage with me on this matter.
About a month before thanksgiving, I hadn't seen my family member for a few months because I was planning to cut her out of my life. She started talking to me a little bit about it, realizing what was going on and the high stakes involved. She told me she was going to tell the family that I prefer Ray and used 'they' around me. She also said she had been looking at resources online to understand queer and genderqueer identities.
I didn't really believe her at first. I didn't understand where that change came from.
I feel uncomfortable talking about my gender queer identity. I internalized these feelings, which makes me physically uncomfortable during interactions. I believe my discomfort is always related to my body, and I'm not always actively aware of when I internalize these feelings.
I notice that when certain issues aren't pointed out, I eventually feel frustrated, sad, and angry due to feeling rejected. This impacts my tolerance of other things that bother me and manifests itself in unexpected ways, which can be quite distracting.
I tend to close off and disassociate from family situations, as there's an anticipated misunderstanding from my family. They don't seem to notice when I do this, and I feel isolated because they don't reach out to me.
I feel that gender is such a complicated thing and it's really personal. I appreciate when someone is interested in understanding the intricacies of my own personal gender, although it's hard for people to completely understand what I'm feeling. I also don't like the secrecy and hiding in some situations, like with my family. I would prefer them to say transphobic things to my face so that I can explain myself and maybe enlighten them a little bit.
I'm feeling frustrated because I can't openly discuss my family situation with my mother, as I lack the financial and emotional stability to sever ties. Instead, I feel like I just have to conceal everything and not talk about it.
I'm a student of psychology and I feel uncomfortable and dissatisfied with the field of psychology. It's confusing and makes me not want to spend time at school. I study social and cultural psychology, but I can't claim my own experience. It causes me to feel resentful about the work I put my time and energy into.
I feel really isolated and it's different talking to someone outside of my close circles. I have to put on a shield and expect to be misunderstood when I'm not in a safe space with my friends.
As a patient, I want to express that I don't want to feel judged by people, but I know that it's inevitable. I'm here to share how I'm feeling and the struggles I'm going through. It's difficult to internalize these negative emotions and it feels heavy and exhausting. How should I cope with these things?
I feel like there's a barrier between me and non-queer or cis people. I want them to ask questions to better understand my experiences, but I often find that they don't. I'm willing to teach them the language I'm using, but I need to see that they're genuinely interested.
I felt that they want to learn themselves from the situation.
I felt reasonably comfortable talking with you today. I think I have developed the discourse around my issues, and it's important to be talking to people who share that discourse or have familiarity with it. If this conversation happened years ago, before I developed this discourse and met others with similar experiences, I would have more trouble vocalizing my needs and situating my experiences within a narrative.
As a patient, I need a therapist who understands my language and the way I talk about my experiences. I want to feel heard and not like I'm being educated or led in a direction that doesn't feel authentic to me. It's important that I come to my own understanding within the context of my life and social circles.
I prefer having a therapist who identifies as queer themselves because it makes me feel safer and more understood. I find it harder to build trust with people who aren't queer, but once trust is earned with a queer therapist, I feel more comfortable opening up to them.
I think in general I'm treated differently than other people that I see, which is the result of a bunch of different things. I live an alternative lifestyle which I think is very intertwined with my gender. I choose to put myself in social circles where people feel similarly and they're accepting, but when I leave those circles, I'm always shocked at what the real world is like and feel overlooked.
I'm a graduate student and I feel like the black sheep of my program. My gender is unacknowledged and in those situations, I'm read as queer or lesbian. I don't feel safe correcting people.
I don't feel like it's me when people use the wrong pronouns for me, and it's confusing. I think of it as a role I play. I have separate lives – my school life and my personal life, and I don't participate in school the way I would if I felt safe to come out there.
I feel like this new change is going to be the creation of me. It's going to be the next step in my life on my own. Even though I've been on my own, I never felt like I was actually going to begin a path.
In my new life, I would hope to actually create my own family, begin a new career, and just be myself.
I've been focused on doing my part in the family to keep us together, and I never thought a different future would be a possibility. Now that I'm considering it, it's both scary and exciting.
I have always been focused on taking care of my mom and the kids, and never imagined myself moving away from that mentality. But now, I'm starting to see and envision a different life for myself, and it makes me smile.
I've been struggling with the idea of pulling away from my family, but I'm worried that it might make me feel alone.
I have been struggling with being pulled in different directions. Upon reflecting on this conversation, I realized it's more about finding myself and understanding why this bothers me so much. It seems that the values my mom instilled in me are the reason I feel this way. If I hadn't learned those values, it wouldn't be such a difficult situation for me.
I am trying to understand how I can be pulled and it helps me reinforce and prove to my mom that I am still the person that she raised and I haven't changed.
I have been trying to live up to my mother's expectations and fulfill what she wanted for me in my life. I listened to everything she ever told me and now I am doing my best to fulfill her expectations as I grow up.
As we talk about my relationship with my mother and why it's so important, I think that's what's making me lean towards this new life. If it had been a male, she would have asked or pushed me to work on that.
I feel scared thinking about losing my family and not having anyone to share my pain with. I think I need to put my family on pause to see if that's the happiness I'm going to get but I don't want them to be out of the picture completely, and I know I don't have total control over the situation.
I would like to embrace this new direction in my life, but I also want to make sure that my heart remains open to my family and especially to my mom. Is that a fair summary?
As the patient, I feel a sense of responsibility to advocate for my friend, and I would like to find ways on how to push on her behalf.
I am struggling to decide whether to maintain a relationship with my family or to create a new life for myself and my partner, distancing myself from some hurtful and difficult aspects of my family. This decision is related to whether or not to speak to my mother about my sexual orientation.
I made the coming out decision because of my feelings for my partner and my desire to have unity with them and my family. Family is very important to me.
I had hope in my family, especially with my mom accepting my siblings' choices in their significant others, even with the mistakes that we've all made. It felt like she would accept the good and the bad, and it made me hopeful for our relationships.
Recently, I've been struggling with my relationship with myself and feeling responsible for everything. I feel like there might be other people who view me differently and have different stories about me. I'm curious if this could be woven into a different account or perspective on my situation.
As a patient, I wanted to tell you about an introduction to Externalizing, and I also learned about counter stories.
I'm trying to make a decision, but sometimes after making one, other decisions appear that I never thought of. One decision always leads to another, and sometimes the next one is harder than the previous one. This has been my experience.
I recently decided to tell my mom that I am gay because I started a relationship with someone. In the past, I figured if I didn't listen to anybody, then what my mom would have to think wouldn't matter. But I initially took it hard and expected all of that.
I recently made a decision that my mother is finding hard to accept. Now I have to decide if I want to continue being a part of my family or pull away and start my own family. My mother wants to pretend that my decision doesn't exist and this is making it difficult for my significant other to be a part of my life.
I have been struggling with the idea of making a new life and continuing the family life I always had because I'm worried about the burden and strain it might put on my new relationship.
As the patient, I feel that there are certain aspects of my life where I exhibit responsibility, but I still struggle with tardiness. I would like to explore these exceptions and understand how responsibility plays a role in various aspects of my life.
I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately with everything going on in my life. I tend to focus on my responsibilities, but recently I've been trying to explore my curiosity instead. However, I feel like I'm struggling to find that balance between responsibility and curiosity.
I have been feeling out of place due to my punctuality in my family. They have a different approach to time management, and it has been bothering me as it makes me stand out.
I have been struggling with feeling responsible for everything happening around me, and it's affecting my relationships with others. I don't know how to deal with this.
I introduced my partner to my mom at my birthday dinner. My mom throws a dinner for me every year and it was during that time when my partner and I were working together. My mom was talking with all my friends at the party, and some of them already knew her. My partner and my mom just grabbed a cup of coffee and sat at the kitchen table while the rest of us were outside.
I was sitting and feeling all inside of it. The next day, my mom made a comment about whether to speak to her or not. I'm not too sure about the whole conversation, but she remembered her and that's when it counts.
I recently talked to my mom about my new partner. It was a significant moment for me because she has memory issues, and she seemed to remember our conversation. She even made room in her consciousness for my partner, which made me happy.
I didn't tell her that day. It was a while after, after my partner and I secured more of our relationship. It was at a point where I wouldn't say pulling away, it was more like I was starting to build the relationship which was taking time, away from being able to spend time with my mom.
I was hoping, considering my partner's history, that she would be accepting and open to me bringing my partner into the family. However, there are formalities involved in introducing them and I am worried about how the informal part before that will unfold.
Lately, I've been taking my partner to generic parties so that my family, especially my mom, can get to know them better. This is a kind of interaction that my family expects from me and my partner. I'm wondering if this is a common thing to do for other people's fiances too.
I was hopeful that my mom would get along well with my partner since they both share a similar background of being born in Mexico and coming from a small town. My partner embodies many qualities that my mom would want for me in a partner, so I thought that would help them bond.
I've always been told by my mom to find someone who shares the same likes, family values, and education as me, and who can always make me laugh.
I feel like we only briefly touched on my story during our conversation, and I noticed that there wasn't enough time to develop the counter story.
As a patient, I need help in exploring my preferences and understanding my future possibilities, even if some might be sorrowful. I notice there are contrasting aspects in my identity and would like to know more about these counter stories.
I feel a lot of pressure in my family to be punctual, as everyone is always on time. It stresses me out, even if I'm just a few minutes late. Because of this, I'm really worried about how it affects my work, as I don't want to seem unreliable or irresponsible.
Over the years, I have been struggling with an issue that has affected various aspects of my life, such as work, family, friendships, and my self-concept. It also influences my mood and the way I see myself.
I have been experiencing a lot of pain lately, and it's been affecting different aspects of my life. I started to discuss the issue with someone, touching on various domains, but I still feel like I haven't fully explored the extent of the impact it has on me.
I've been feeling overwhelmed with different issues in my work life and family life. I feel like we could discuss more aspects if we had more time together.
I have been feeling annoyed with myself lately, and I'm not sure if this is helpful or not. I've also been thinking about whether there's something I should be doing more or less of.
I recently saw my mom and partner in a different light, almost to the point where I didn't recognize my mom. It was very painful for me because I had big hopes and love for both of them. I even told my mom that my partner is the daughter she would have hoped for.
I feel like my partner has a characteristic that could make them really good friends with another person. I've spoken with them about it and I'm not sure if they truly understood what I meant.
I feel like my mother believes that being gay is unnatural and unfulfilling, and it's affecting me negatively. She's very traditional and thinks that not having a man in my life will prevent me from being successful.
I've been thinking about having a real partner lately. I believe that sometimes it is a man's strength that can push women into the next level of womanhood. Also, I have been considering the idea of having kids, which might make my mother happy as she wants grandchildren.
I'm concerned that my big family and constant family parties will eventually put a strain on my relationship. I feel like I always have to choose between my partner and my family, especially since my mom doesn't approve of my partner.
I had hopes for my relationships to work well, but things didn't go as planned, and it was disappointing. Now, I'm struggling to decide where to put my energy in my relationships with the people I care about and love, especially when things are not easily coming together and there's a lack of unity.
As a patient, I understand that my situation is an ongoing process and will not be resolved immediately. I am not ready to address a specific issue right now, but I'm sure that there will be more decisions to be made in the future.
I feel worried about the choices I have to make in my life. No matter which path I take, I see some pain for me and my loved ones, be it my mother or my partner. It seems like the pain is unavoidable, at least in the immediate future.
I have somebody, but it's always been my family. You know, they have been the, the. My love for my family has changed, right?
I've been struggling with the feelings of guilt, but my mother has always trusted me and we have been very close throughout our lives.
I want to make sure that I am doing right by my mom, showing her that I can have strong family values that she placed in me. But she doesn't approve of the family that I am trying to hopefully make and have.
I feel that if I rely more on my mom and the structure I had in the past, it might take away from my partnership. I worry that we can never be a full part of each other's lives if I rely too much on my past.
I know my partner wouldn't have a problem with me picking a certain path because she is familiar with that as well. But I could still see a strain being put on that relationship.
I recently had a conversation with my mom, who seemed to sense that there was something going on in my life that I wasn't telling her. She noticed that I hadn't been coming around as often and asked about it during lunch. She told me that she knew something was happening, but I didn't have to share it with her if I didn't want to.
I decided to talk to my mother about my partner, hoping she would be accepting of our relationship. However, she told me that she would never accept my partner and wouldn't have allowed them in the house if she knew earlier. She said she did not raise me to be gay and does not want us around her house.
My sister recently found out about my sexuality and has not allowed me to go back in. She even doesn't want us to be together when I have to take care of my niece and nephew. Her strong reaction is something I didn't expect, and as a result, I haven't spoken to my mom for a month, which has been really hard for me because I usually talk to her daily.
I've been really struggling lately. It just killed me off on everything that I thought I knew about my mom...
I just had a conversation with someone named Donna, and we engaged in what's called an Externalizing Conversation. I am curious to know more about what externalizing is and how it's used in narrative counseling practice.
I am struggling with a habit that seems to have control over me, affecting my life and shaping my decisions. I feel like the habit is not a part of me, but rather an external influence.
Lately, I've been feeling like something is wrong with me, like I have a problem that's been affecting different aspects of my life. I feel like the problem has been around for a long time, and it's been getting worse.
I had a check list in my head, the words length, breadth and depth.
I've been struggling with negative self-doubting thoughts and it's difficult for me to hang on to accomplished thoughts when I'm feeling really low. I think my dad leaving when I was just three months old has a big impact on me. I've always had this inner fear of abandonment, and the idea that he didn't want me replays a lot in my life.
I have struggled with the belief that my father left when I was three months old because he didn't want to be with me. He tried to explain his side, saying he felt he wouldn't make a good father and we were better off without him due to his own history of abuse. It's hard for me to wrap my head around this. I wish I didn't depend on others for happiness, but I don't know how to do that.
I was feeling tense and unsure about what to do in our counseling session. I didn't want to step across any boundaries, but now I feel more relaxed and the line seems clearer.
As a patient, I just wanted to express my confidence in maintaining ethical boundaries and professionalism in my work. I feel more relaxed about it now.
I'm feeling better now, but I'm still a bit concerned about working with a particular client. I have a plan to achieve success, but I'm not sure about the limitations of our relationship and the direction they want to go.
As a patient, I was afraid that the counsellor wanted more than a professional relationship, but the counsellor clarified they are helping me with setting goals and a plan to create a network for friends and socialization. I appreciate that this approach is sincere, avoids embarrassment, and continues the therapeutic relationship.
I am a therapist and have a client who has recently invited me to dinner. I want to maintain our professional relationship, but I am unsure how to handle this situation without potentially damaging our therapeutic connection. What should my next step be for our next session?
I'm feeling uncomfortable and apprehensive in my counseling sessions because I think the client is trying to flirt with me or has an attraction towards me. This is causing me to become more defensive in order to maintain ethical boundaries. I'm not sure if I'm doing anything wrong or crossing any boundaries unintentionally. What should I do?
I'm a therapist and I've been working with a client who recently brought me flowers as a gift. He told me they were free because they came from his mother's garden. Although at first, I didn't want to accept the gift, I eventually did, but I decided to place them in our waiting room for everyone to enjoy. I'm trying to make sure I don't cross any boundaries and keep the relationship professional. Do you think accepting the flowers in this way was appropriate?
This week has been pretty smooth, but I have one client that I'm struggling with. He came in for depression, and I'm not sure how I should work with him.
I've been seeing a patient for 12 sessions about his failing relationships and coping skills. Recently, I noticed a change in his demeanor. He started dressing differently, giving me compliments, and seemed happier. But now he's making small comments related to us, and I've started feeling awkward and more on the defensive. His comments are not inappropriate but are different from the norm. He even asks about my week and what I do in my spare time.
As a counsellor, I recently received flowers from one of my patients. While I don't think I crossed any ethical boundaries, I'm unsure if I should have accepted the gift or not. I'm afraid it might escalate into something else. I usually accept gifts if they are gestures of thankfulness and don't have monetary value, but should I have discussed this further with the patient?
I accepted a gift from a client so as not to offend him, but then he started asking me out to dinner and trying to make plans with me. I feel like the situation has escalated and I'm not sure how to handle it now.
I am a client who is trying to get over a bad relationship and start my life anew. I recently mentioned inviting the counselor out, and I think it might be related to my desire to start a new relationship.
I recently faced a situation with a client who made a friendly gesture that crossed a boundary. I told them nicely that I appreciate the offer but cannot accept due to professional reasons. The client accepted my response but I'm unsure if I handled it well. Should I have said something different?
Last week, you asked me if I wanted to go out with you for your birthday in about two weeks. But, we had to end the session before I could address it. I appreciate that you feel comfortable enough with me to invite me to your birthday, but I feel that as your counsellor, it's not appropriate for me to go out with you outside of our sessions.
I prefer to maintain our professional relationship with my client. He first came for counseling because he had difficulty maintaining relationships and was dealing with a breakup. I believe he now feels comfortable enough with me and is considering starting a relationship. However, I want to keep our relationship strictly as client and counselor. I don't know if that sounds too harsh, and I struggle to find a better way to express it.
I felt silly having to talk to someone about my problem, and I thought I'd look silly as well. I also felt a little bit pessimistic about the situation.
I don't think I believe people can help me, and if I'm honest, there is a part of me that thinks that here as well. It's really hard for me to say this.
I often feel like my mom is sitting on my shoulder, especially in situations where a lot is expected from me. It reminds me of her telling me to put myself together and not be self-indulgent.
I don't know what to say to this person who keeps bothering me. I really want to tell her to just buzz off, but I don't know if that's the right thing to do. We're busy and working, and I want her to understand that.
I felt like a naughty school girl being called in front of the headmasters, like I did something wrong. It happened once in school and that's how it felt this time too. In the situation, there were two reporting managers due to an overlap in my job roles, but I still wonder what I've done wrong.
I feel like my organization is picking on me. I’m not aware of it being like that for anybody else, and it seems that they may be unfairly targeting me.
I recently realized that I don't have to hold onto my childhood beliefs anymore and that how I feel isn't necessarily how I look. This could explain why my teachers didn't help me, and why my parents thought I was alright without assistance. I feel like I've taken this belief with me as I've grown.
I've realized I can use my experiences to my benefit in presentations, but I also need to learn to share my feelings more with others. I'm amazed at how much I've learned from this.
I've been considering using a daily thought record and maybe even keeping a journal because I think it might help me. I want to recognize the negative automatic thoughts and challenge them.
I've learned that when I feel something is true, it might not necessarily mean it is true.
I've recently started looking at the evidence for some of my beliefs that people don't help me. This has led me to rethink some of my childhood beliefs as well.
Even if my partner complimented my appearance, I wouldn't believe him. I don't want to look silly, and sometimes I feel like I sound silly or whiny.
I think as I watched the video, I was watching your reaction to me as well. I think if you had reacted with an expression, it might have confirmed that I was wasting your time and being silly. But you didn't, so there is a part of me that wants to believe your honest feedback.
I feel like when people, including you, say something nice about me, they might just be saying it to be nice and not because they actually believe it. I worry that I sound or look silly and I wonder if you're just trying to be polite.
I've been hearing a voice in my head lately, and it is very critical of me.
I never thought of it before, but it's true - I don't expect anyone to do anything for me. In fact, when I am in a crowd of people, I expect them to be antagonistic and not like me.
I've been feeling like other people think they're better than me, and it's been bothering me. These beliefs have stuck around even when they may not be accurate or useful anymore.
I often feel like people are not very interested in what I have to say and just vaguely paying attention. It's disheartening and makes it difficult for me to connect with others.
I had a presentation recently and noticed that my colleagues seemed more intelligent than me. The previous presenter was quite boring, so everyone was already disengaged. As I was talking about a product they didn't know much about, some of them seemed distracted and uninterested.
I feel like people are not listening to me and they're just bored. I'm not making any sense here.
I feel like my colleagues are cleverer than me. One of them didn't do a great presentation, but he is a doctor and I think he's still more intelligent than I am.
I am worried that being clever doesn't necessarily make someone interesting to the audience. I've noticed that some great speakers are not particularly technical. Are there any ways to be both clever and keep the audience interested?
I've been really concerned lately about whether I'm not as clever as others around me.
I have been thinking that people don't like me and it's bothering me a lot. I never thought that maybe they are having some consideration for me by not imposing their dislikes on me.
I play cards with Mike and Sovia quite regularly. I feel more comfortable when there are not many other people around. I guess it's because I only feel at ease with my immediate neighbors.
I feel left out when more people are involved, and I guess I just want to be in a smaller group where I feel better. But I don't understand why I feel more left out than others.
I sometimes feel tense and struggle to start conversations with others. I often can't think of the right thing to start the conversation with.
I had to give a lecture using PowerPoint in a lecture theater even though I wasn't feeling well and not familiar with the software. As I started talking about my product, people appeared bored and were chatting at the back. This made me lose concentration and my ability to continue speaking. I felt embarrassed and ended my presentation quickly.
I was wearing my presentation suit, a dark-colored trouser suit, but I wasn't feeling my best. I had an upset stomach and was in quite a bit of pain, which made the situation uncomfortable.
I see in the room, just tears of people sitting in front of me, and they haven't dimmed the lights so I can't see them all. They are in white coats and they have stethoscopes, so I know they're doctors.
I remember a horrible experience where I couldn't show my anger around my peers. I had to pretend that I was too upset.
I think I was quite negligent and the girls were really cruel to me. I feel stupid because I didn't have the courage to stick out for myself.
I was with a group of people but I felt like there was a boundary separating me from them. I attended a co-ed school, and the other girls had all paired up but they were more girly girls and I wasn't.
I didn't fit in with the girly girls because I didn't do ballet or like horses. I was different from them and felt alone. I don't know why I was like that.
I don't know why I changed up with them, and I don't know why I wasn't on my own. I had a sense that I was my own person, but I used to try really hard to please them. Deep down inside, I knew that whatever I do, they wouldn't like me.
I have been going through therapy and things have been improving. However, I am about to move to a new area and I am worried about meeting new people and facing new situations which might be triggering for me. How can I deal with these situations?
I feel like the ups and downs in my life look like a graph. Sometimes I receive tremendous affirmation, and other times it feels like no one is helping or supporting me. The inconsistency is confusing and overwhelming, as it can happen with both my peers and authority figures.
I've been really busy with work lately, and I find that work is really tiring. Do you think people around me have noticed a difference in me?
I have no energy left at the weekends, and it's nice to just sit and not have to talk. It feels different when someone says they'll take me as I am.
Recently I've been feeling like people are only happy with me when I don't do anything, but they do keep inviting me to events.
When I was 12 years old, I went on a school trip to France. My friends and I were allowed to go shopping, but they ran off and left me alone in one of the big stores in Paris. I was scared and felt like nobody would help me.
I remember when I was on a 10-day holiday with three girls who excluded me from their activities. I felt so left out and hurt. The French teacher's husband actually noticed I wasn't there and came to find me. I had to spend the rest of the holiday with those girls, knowing what they had done.
I feel left out at dinner parties because people don't engage me in conversation and they never greet me like they do others, like how they do mma.
I used to have coffee with my friend Linda, but she doesn't come to see me anymore. I'm not sure why there has been a change.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed since I started working more and it has been affecting my mental health.
I've noticed quite a change at work recently, and it seems like some of my coworkers are avoiding me, especially when it comes to socializing outside of work. Sovia, for example, has never come over for tea or coffee.
I've been feeling upset because I didn't receive any calls for some events, even though others got their invitations. I don't understand how they could have invited those people without calling me too.
I'm in a high-pressure situation where people seem to not listen to me, and I feel like they think I'm stupid. I'm not as clever as them, and I feel like a fool. How do you think someone else in the same situation might feel?
I've been feeling angry and anxious lately. It's difficult for me to feel good or safe, and I think my thoughts are playing a big role in that. I feel like only a small minority of people could feel laid back in my situation.
I felt exposed and rushed, trying to hurry up and not look at people around me. I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible because I thought people became aware of me feeling stuck.
I'm sure at that point, they were beginning to sort of shifting their seats and it was obvious that I was, you know, not finishing the presentation properly. I was, you know, rushing it.
I feel like I might not be as clever as my colleagues, and because of that, I worry that I won't be able to hold their interest in conversations or during presentations.
I recently gave a presentation to a room of about 40 or 50 people. I noticed that a few people, especially a row at the back and some doctors in the front, were not paying attention to me. It made me feel anxious and unsure about my performance.
I felt that the four or five people out of 50 in the room who were not paying attention to me were the most important ones, and I am concerned about their lack of engagement.
I feel anxious when I notice people looking out of the window during my presentation. I start having negative thoughts like they're not listening to me and they think I'm stupid.
I feel like I'm not as clever as others and it makes me feel like a fool.
As a patient, I find myself struggling with nerves during presentations and feel like I don't handle the pressure as well as my coworker Sheila, who seems to not worry quite so much and is more confident in front of groups. I think it would be great if I could be a bit more like her.
I feel like my friends don't like me because they've met without inviting me when six or four of them gather.
I’ve noticed that some people have met without me and are attending weight watchers, supposedly to help me. As I have been writing these things down, I'm actually feeling that it must be true.
I often struggle with timing in conversations. By the time I figure out what I want to say, the conversation has moved on and it feels too late to say anything. I find myself trying to think of something entertaining, amusing, interesting, or funny to say, but it's difficult to find the right moment.
I feel like in fast-moving conversations, I might have stopped trying quite hard. I have been worried and tired with work lately, and I think that has affected my communication.
I've been struggling a lot with my job lately because it involves a lot of talking, presenting, and performing, and I feel like it's becoming really hard for me. I've even stopped trying quite hard because of how challenging it has become.
I&apos;m having trouble acting naturally and just saying what's on my mind. I'm concerned about coming across as silly. I remember talking about an appraisal and not giving my permission to ask. I've been feeling tired and a bit fed up with work, which has made me less engaged.
I recently found out that a schoolmate of mine went through the same issues with her parents, but she actually became worse because she couldn't mourn with them at school. After that, they still carried on afterward. What do you think about this situation?
I've been reflecting on my past and realized that my parents tried to help me in certain situations, but it actually didn't turn out to be helpful. I'm wondering if this has impacted my current mindset.
As the therapy is coming to an end, I feel somewhat worried about losing the positive changes I've made during this process. I've heard that many times, those gains do not generalize to the person's life and get washed out. How can I ensure that I maintain the progress I've made?
I've been feeling that no one will help me, but I suppose some people have actually helped me in the past. I can't expect everyone to help me, but maybe I can expect some people to help me. I'm just as likely as anyone else to be helped.
I've been feeling like there's something different about me that makes me less worthy of helping others, but I'm starting to realize that I'm just like everyone else. I might even be more helpful or attractive to some people I help.
I've been struggling with negative thoughts and feeling alone. My counsellor, Frank, suggested I start a positive log where I write down instances when people have helped me. This way, I can remind myself that there are people who care for me when I'm feeling low. I told him that he has helped me a lot too.
Lately, I've been noticing that I have some double standards and it's been bothering me. I think I shouldn't have let it get to me this much, but I'm feeling really self-critical about it.
I've noticed that I might be being tougher on myself than I am with other people. I'm usually empathic towards others and it's an important aspect of my job since I have to understand my clients' needs.
I feel like the more I share about myself and how I'm not functioning well, the less likely I am to come to these sessions. Also, I was worried about not looking good in a video, and when I watched it, I was right.
I just had a conversation with my husband, and we were discussing something together. I feel like his opinion might be biased, but I'm not sure.
I feel embarrassed when I'm blushing, and it's especially embarrassing when someone is being nice to me. I think it's because I don't expect people to treat me kindly, so it's always a surprise.
I feel silly needing to talk, because I should know better and be able to cope on my own. I don't think it's weak for others to seek help, but for some reason, I hold myself to different standards.
Lately, I've been struggling with sleep because I tend to chastise myself during my postmortem thoughts at night. I think if I was kinder to myself, I might sleep better.
I don't believe anyone would help me because I can't expect everybody to help me all the time, even though there have been people who have helped me, been really helpful and influential, and given me lots of positives.
I've noticed that I tend to forget about living in the present and always worry about the next problem. It's almost like I'm constantly looking for problems instead of enjoying what's here and now. I feel like my worry is like blinkers, stopping me from seeing anything other than the issues in my life.
I felt that my parents gave a lot of encouragement to my brother after he failed his exams, but when it came to me, they kind of just assumed that I would do well and didn't provide much support. I also had to go to a different school than I preferred because of my sister's experience.
When I was younger, my sister had a negative experience at her girls' grammar school, so my parents decided not to send me there. Instead, they sent me to a co-ed school. I've often wondered how my relationship with my parents might have been different if they had made a different decision.
I feel like my parents didn't have much energy left for me growing up. They were focused on my sister because she had problems during her teenage years, and my brother had an accident when he was little and fractured his skull, which led to a long stay in the hospital.
I felt really uncomfortable during a recent meeting because there was an extra person present, and it felt like they were watching my back and out to find faults in me. I normally do better in one-to-one situations, but having this additional person really made me feel like I needed to perform at a higher level. This incident also triggered my core belief that people aren't really there to help me.
I just walked in and roared they there and I could feel my heart racing. I could feel all the similar symptoms I get when I stand up and do a presentation. So, I was having to concentrate on trying to reduce those and not look stupid in front of them, which actually made things worse.
As the patient, I feel that there is a very pervasive issue that I'm facing, and it seems like even therapists can see it that way.
I've been experiencing conflicts with my partner over trivial things. For example, we can be reading the newspaper and when we discuss what's going on in the world, Bill will share his opinion and I'll disagree. He gets indignant when I tell him I don't think he's right. This competitive dynamic makes me feel unsure about how to handle these situations.
I don't think of myself as being competitive, but my husband keeps telling me that I am and that I'm always trying to one-up him. This really bothers me because I never thought of myself as competitive, and I think I'm just competitive with myself, not with others.
I don't think I'm a competitive person, but others say that I am. I'm not sure why there's a difference in perception.
I am in my second marriage now, and I'm very happy with my husband Bill. However, I see the same thing happening to him that happened when I was married to my first husband, John.
I always feel like I'm wrong in every situation and end up in petty arguments even though I try to be cooperative. I do everything to help and still get accused of being unreasonable, which I don't believe I am. I think I'm quite reasonable actually.
I feel like I'm always getting into arguments and giving in, even when I think I might be right. I never hear them say I'm right, only that they are. This pattern is similar to what I experienced in my previous relationship, and now it's creating problems in my marriage.
I feel like my husband doesn't care about me because he doesn't pick up on my feelings or agree with me. This makes me depressed, and both of us withdraw and sulk for a week. I think it's his fault since he never really reaches out and seems to reject my efforts to connect. My previous marriage had similar issues.
I feel like I understand what you're saying, but it's going to be hard for me to change. I already feel like I'm ready to fight again and I'm trying to justify my actions, even when I know they are wrong. I realize this seems to be a pattern I've established.
I often find myself disagreeing with the men in my life when we're discussing current events. For example, my friend will share his opinion about a situation in the news, and I don't think he's analyzing it correctly. So, I'll tell him that I don't think he's right and explain my viewpoint.
I find myself getting into competitions with my partner about who is right in a discussion, even over simple topics. It escalates and we end up arguing, with my partner saying my tone of voice is unreasonable. I feel like we're always trying to win, and it's causing conflict in our relationship.
I feel really conflicted because on one hand, I think I am able to handle the situation, but on the other hand, I can't help but feel angry about it.
As a patient, I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately and it's hard for me to calm down. This situation is causing me to start getting depressed.
I have been feeling annoyed and angry lately, and I seem to have this underlying anger that's similar to what I feel toward my ex-husband.
As a patient, I'd like to discuss some issues I've been facing recently. I'm struggling with integrating certain aspects of my life, and it's not easy for me. I think I might need some help in changing some patterns that are causing me distress.
I have decided to take risks in different aspects of my life, such as friendships, work, and school, as I attempt this recovery journey. I am not a half measures person, so I want to commit to this journey wholeheartedly.
I had trouble getting diagnosed initially because my doctor told me I'm not the type to be anorexic and I'm too smart for that. Even when I got diagnosed and admitted into the hospital, she still didn't believe it and just wanted to help me gain weight.
I've been struggling with my weight, and my doctor doesn't think I'm anorexic, just skinny. I saw a psychiatrist for years, but he wasn't helpful, he couldn't remember anything about me that wasn't in line with a case study of anorexia nervosa. When I mentioned anything different, it seemed like he didn't understand.
I felt like my therapist wouldn't remember my issues and it made me mold myself into more of a case study to fit the diagnosis. It almost felt like a privilege to be there, but not in a helpful way.
I've been struggling with whether or not I fit the description of having anorexia. There were a lot of different opinions about it, and it influenced how I saw myself. I also found myself comparing and competing with others who may have anorexia.
I feel like therapy is a shared experience, and I can't trust someone if they don't offer me something. I need a really good sense of the therapist and who they are as a person. Even though there's so much I don't know about you, I think I have a good sense of that. Would I be sensitive if you were suddenly trying to coerce me in some way? Yes, very sensitive.
I think I'm pretty sensitive to other people's intentions and I would feel it if someone was pushing me somewhere. I've had therapy before where it almost felt like the therapist was trying to convince me to recover.
I've noticed that when people around me try to encourage my healthy self, it sometimes causes me to respond with my eating disorder voice, leading to a debate between their healthy intentions and my eating disorder.
As a patient, I am unsure if losing weight is the right path for me and I'm considering the potential consequences that might come with it. I need guidance on whether or not I should pursue this and how to align my goals with my well-being.
I feel like when I'm in front of an audience or a group of people, I'm constantly being judged and evaluated, which makes me extremely anxious and worried.
I usually feel tense, nervous, and have sweaty palms when I have to make a presentation. This anxiety lasts until around two days before the presentation, and that's when I tell myself that I have to do it and start preparing.
I recently took a decision that required a lot of courage on my part. I set things out and went ahead with it, but now I'm feeling really unsure about whether it was the right thing to do or not. I'm open to trying something new, but I'm curious about how risky it would be.
As a patient, I was told that for the next time when I'm asked to make a presentation, I should postpone preparing for it until the day before it's due, not two or three days before. I'm not sure if I can do that.
I feel like I have a strong desire to achieve in my professional life, but at the same time, I want to make sure I fulfill my responsibilities at home and be present for my family. Lately, it seems like I'm not able to manage or balance both of these aspects in the way I want.
For the past 10 years, I've been traveling a lot in service to my religious community, which has been wonderful. However, I've recently decided to adjust my commitment to be more available for my children as they're getting to an age where they really need me.
I've been feeling the need to be more involved with my family life. We are a close family and we do a lot of things together. It's not that there are problems or difficulties, but I felt the need for my physical presence. It's not only the family needing me, but I also needed to be there for myself.
Lately, I've been feeling exhausted because my new job has a lot of responsibilities and requires me to commute an hour and a half to get home. By the time I get home, it's around eight thirty or nine o'clock, and it's really starting to wear on me.
I've been feeling overwhelmed because I have a lot on my plate. In the organization I'm part of, I'm fairly high placed and I want to be a model for others in terms of the intensity of my work.
I find that there are a couple of times when I felt fatigued and decided to leave work right at five o'clock. On my way home, I thought that maybe it was not such a good idea. I feel torn between staying at work and wanting to be with my family.
I have always been forced to play the piano by my mother, who was a good piano player herself. She made me enter contests and learn new pieces, which I would have to memorize and perform in front of a judge. This would make me extremely nervous, upset, and worried, to the point that I would become hysterical before the performance.
I have been feeling really anxious lately, especially when it comes to performing in front of an audience. I worry that I will forget my piece and be judged for it. My concern is mainly about pleasing others, like my mother and my family, and I have performance anxiety.
I think I have performance anxiety, which happens when I have to present in front of people, whether it's at school or in front of a class. It's similar to the feeling I get when I'm performing on stage.
When I was eight years old, I used to enjoy playing the piano.
I feel really anxious when I have to speak in front of a group. It's so nerve-wracking, hugely anxiety-producing, and incredibly stressful for me.
Well I have to speak in front of my school and I just get very nervous. My hands get all wet and sweaty and my stomach turns. I worry about it for days ahead and sometimes I don't sleep well. I try to prepare beforehand but I never feel really comfortable. It's always very difficult and stressful. Sometimes, if I really get organized and have overheads ready and practice a bit, I feel a little bit better, but that's rare.
I don't know why I keep putting off being prepared. I keep telling myself that I can do it tomorrow and I end up not dealing with it. I feel anxious about it and worry about how it's going to turn out.
I just don't do anything about it. I just keep worrying about it.
I get really anxious whenever I have to make a presentation. I constantly worry about who I'll be presenting to and whether they'll like it or not. I feel like it's a reflection on me personally and professionally.
I've been struggling to stay positive lately. I was thinking of trying to remember how my grandma manages to be positive and keep going every single day. Maybe thinking of her could help me too.
I have been feeling overwhelmed about a series of tasks I need to complete today, tomorrow, and the next day. I want to find some extra strength to get through it all.
Lately, I've been feeling concerned and anxious. When this happens, my hands get sweaty, my stomach starts turning, and I don't sleep well at night. I often wake up and think about it in the middle of the night.
As a patient, I want to share the story of this woman in my life. She is a very responsible person and without complaining, she just carried out her duties, like feeding the family. This was part of her life and she took responsibility for it because she knew no one else would do it.
I think I procrastinate and I wish I could be more responsible like my mother, attacking things and doing them on time, being on top of it all. I was thinking, maybe if I viewed my own responsibilities like her chores, it could make a difference?
I've been putting off a task and I'm feeling anxious about it. I don't want to go through any emotional trauma but I'm worried that other people may judge me.
Lately, I've been feeling unsure about how to handle certain situations and often find myself hesitating to take action. I think it might be helpful to explore potential solutions.
I've been trying to incorporate spirituality into all aspects of my life, like family, work, and religious beliefs, to make it more fulfilling and wholesome. But I'm having trouble fully integrating it, and I feel conflicted about my spiritual journey.
I'm struggling with various aspects of my life and trying to make the whole process more integrated.
As a patient, I am concerned about a presentation and would like your advice on what I can do as soon as I detect anxiety.
I tend to start worrying and feel anxious. I was advised to try taking deep breaths and visualizing myself on a peaceful lake during summertime to help calm myself down.
I only feel at ease when I am relaxed. Should I start my work once I feel more relaxed?
I've been experiencing worry and anxiety due to certain expectations that people have placed on me in the past. Can you help me explore this issue?
When I was eight, I started taking piano lessons. My mother, who had a background in music, was quite involved in the process.
I wanted to talk about some challenges I'm having with work. It's a bit difficult for me to come here and talk to you about this.
I've recently taken on a new position with more responsibility, but I now have to commute an hour and a half each way. I find myself still working at the office until late hours like 7 o'clock, which means I don't get home until very late since I used to only be 15-30 minutes from home.
I'll definitely get anxious about this one, but hang on, I'll try. I will also monitor myself through that week as you suggested.
I am going to keep a diary about what's happening to me, my worries, concerns, and how I'm feeling.
I've been feeling really worried lately, and sometimes the worry feels bigger in my mind than it really is. I want to fully understand the intensity of my worry, so I can better handle it.
I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately and I'm struggling to cope with it. My counsellor suggested trying to break things down, so they might not feel as looming as I originally thought.
I feel stressed and overwhelmed lately. I can think of a place that brings me peace - our place on Lake Subtleby. It's beautiful and lovely to look at the lake by the water. I like to be down by the beach, looking out during a quiet part of the day when the motor boats are gone, watching the sailboats and seeing the mountains in the background.
I closed my eyes and visualized a beautiful lake as per the counsellor's suggestion. I also took deep breaths and exhaled slowly.
I am feeling the sun beating down on me and my body relaxing, but when I think about the presentation I have to make, my rhythm changes.
I recently discovered a quiet space where I feel at peace. But sometimes, when I feel worried or stressed, I struggle to get back to that quiet space mentally. Can you help me with this?
As a patient, I believe in the importance of a strong religious conviction and the teachings that come with it. It has helped me significantly in my life and has also made me realize the criticality of having a closely-knit family unit.
Lately, I've been feeling extremely frustrated with my daily three-hour commute. I can't help but think about how it adds up to fifteen hours a week, which is practically a part-time job. My spiritual journey and religion are very important to me, and I wish I could spend more time with my family, sharing those values.
I've been thinking about how family, spirituality, and church are connected, and it's something that's been on my mind quite a bit. I feel like I'm the only one who's concerned about this, and I appreciate knowing that there are others who share these thoughts and concerns.
I'm trying to focus on the good in me, like having plans to make something of myself and wanting to help my sister get through her struggles without going through what I've experienced.
I might need to help my mom when she gets older, because she has had a hard time raising two teenage daughters, especially me.
I don't smile often because I'm always in a bad attitude. I feel like it takes courage to come and talk to a counselor, and it's even more difficult for me to be videoed.
I'm not sure what persistence means. Can you explain that to me?
As a patient, I recently had a session with my counsellor where we played a game. They asked me the same question ten times and I had to give a different answer each time. The purpose was to help me think in different ways and explore different perspectives.
I am having trouble thinking of good things about myself. I can think of my intelligence, my attitude when I'm in a good mood, and my friendship, but I can't think of anything else.
As a patient, I struggle to identify positive qualities about myself. I mentioned that I trust others and I have the ability to be a good friend, but I find it increasingly difficult to come up with more positives.
Sometimes, I feel like I'm getting to the bottom of the barrel and I can't find anything in there. I need some more time, but if I can't figure it out, will you tell me good things about myself?
I feel very persistent, and without it, I'd probably have left this place a long time ago due to everything that's been happening. My boyfriend constantly acts like he's right and is difficult to deal with, but I'm still hanging in there with him, as well as work and other issues. I had to persist to get my GED, and I'm still waiting for my birth certificate to get my driver's license.
I feel like there's a part of me that just wants to keep learning and becoming a better person. I want to achieve something that nobody else in my family has ever done.
I've been struggling with my eating habits, and I feel like my history with food is not an exception. I'm having a hard time finding a balance between enjoying food and maintaining a healthy diet. Sometimes I'm tempted by unhealthy options at work, the supermarket, or social gatherings.
Hi, I've been trying to control my eating habits during the day by promising myself my favorite food, Joe-Joe's, as a reward at night. This helps me keep from eating unhealthy foods throughout the day because I know I'll enjoy them later. However, after enjoying my Joe-Joe's, I start to feel guilty and regret my decision.
After eating ice cream, I feel like I won't be able to have it again, so I end up eating as much as I can right away, instead of being able to control myself and enjoy a reasonable portion.
I think it's a great idea to go through the depth and choose the three most compelling thoughts of that day. I am trying to imagine myself in the future being lighter and having achieved some of these things, but in this moment, it's not likely.
I keep a thread next to my bed where my kids and I eat Joe-Joe's, but it feels like a long time ago. I think I ultimately need to model better behavior for them since consuming too many Joe-Joe's might not be the best example.
I think creating a no eating zone in the bed would be a good policy, but the idea is quite scary for me.
I think the most tempting food for me is a chocolate covered Joe-Joe. It's a Trader Joe's Oreo cookie and they cover them in chocolate for the holidays. We have them in our house as holiday gifts, but there's always one person who really doesn't deserve it.
I've been trying to control my diet and stay healthy. One suggestion I heard was to have one favorite food every single day. I'm not sure how many servings of my favorite snack, Joe-Joe's, would be reasonable to eat? A serving is probably two.
I struggle with the idea of moderating my consumption of Joe-Joe's because I feel like it's an all or nothing situation. I'm afraid that if I don't give them up completely, I'll fail and never be able to stop. It's my reward and relaxation after a long day.
I feel like I deserve a reward for my progress, like having a Joe-Joe, but I'm struggling to come up with any other thoughts that might help me justify this. Can you suggest any?
I'm worried about the upcoming holidays and how it might affect my eating habits. I usually struggle with sugar cravings and my PMS can also make things difficult for me.
I am most likely to struggle with chocolate and sugar cravings due to PMS in the next seven days. It usually happens at night, specifically between eight and nine.
I'm finally stopped, I'm finally-- I'm-- this is my downtime. I run crazy all day long and now, it's my-- I can breathe time. And then, I think I can have just one snack while watching TV in bed.
I often think I can have just one, but then I end up overindulging in foods that are high in fat, salt, or sugar.
I just finished eating two Joe-Joe's cookies, and now I'm feeling a lot of anxiety. I have this thought that I won't be able to stop eating and that I've just put 600 calories into my body for these two stupid cookies.
I'm worried about my eating habits, as I've been consuming some really high-calorie foods, but I try to keep my days pretty clean. I'm unsure if having one or two of those high-calorie foods would be a good idea for me.
I used to eat more than two Joe-Joe's every night, and it didn't work for me. I feel anxious after finishing two Joe-Joe's at 8:30 in bed, but I think those are old thoughts.
I consider myself a professional dieter, I've been doing it for a lot of years.
I have an issue with eating Joe-Joe's cookies. I usually can't control myself and end up eating too many. I wouldn't want my teenagers to know where I keep them. I thought about keeping them in my car, but realized that might not be a good choice as I'd be driving around with them inside.
I have a problem with tempting snacks in my house. My office is connected to my house, but I can keep the snacks away in my office.
I've been successful in losing weight and keeping it off, but I'm concerned that Joe-Joe's might become a problem again in the future. I don't think I'll forget the strategy we discussed, but I wouldn't mind having it written down just in case.
Lately, I've been struggling with something, but I'm not sure if it's related to a specific situation at home.
I'm struggling with controlling my hunger and tend to eat spontaneously, which I know is not good for my diet. I need help learning to tolerate and manage these feelings.
As a patient, I often find myself sabotaging my diet and eating at non-scheduled times. When I make a mistake, I tell myself that I'm weak, I'm bad, and that I'll just eat whatever I want and start again tomorrow. I need help dealing with these thoughts.
I recently attended a counselling session and learned some skills to work on. I hope to keep in touch with the counsellor through email. However, I still have some concerns that I'd like to discuss.
I truly believe in the reasons to eat two Joe-Joe's a day, as it will help me resist other junk food throughout the day. I also find the tip of wrapping up food that catches my fancy and bringing it home to be helpful. However, I am not sure if I have all the skills I need to follow through with this plan.
As a patient, I've been trying to focus on changing my eating habits, but my counsellor recommends that I focus more on mastering three dieting skills before making any changes to my diet. She suggested I read a list every morning and evening, eat everything while sitting down, and give myself credit for making healthy eating decisions.
I'm struggling with eating quickly and not being mindful during meals. I also need more time and energy to practice skills for making changes in my eating habits, such as going to the supermarket more often and preparing my meals.
I'm always dragging all of the time and have a really chaotic and crazy schedule. I don't want to carry around extra weight, like 50 pounds, and I don't want to look at myself in the mirror. I have a lot of self-shame.
I want to model better eating habits for my children, it's my top priority right now.
I find it hard to control my cravings for certain foods like Joe-Joe's, and I struggle with not thinking about the negative consequences when I give in to these cravings.
I'm struggling with remembering my coping strategies when I'm faced with tempting situations, like when the Joe-Joe's are calling my name. It seems like the list just disappears from my mind.
I have this whole security routine where I get into bed under my down comforter, put on the TV, and eat. It's a way for me to shut out the world and have my own time. I'm afraid that if I don't have food while doing this, I would lose that relaxation and it would be replaced with anxiety.
I feel like having to admit that my belief might be irrational, but I'm worried that changing it will somehow diminish the bad experience for me.
I have been feeling unhealthy, having very little energy, feeling bad when looking in the mirror, and I am not modeling better eating habits for my kids. I spent three hours of enjoyment indulging in unhealthy food. However, the rest of my day, around 21 hours, was negatively impacted by my poor choices.
When I'm tempted to get out of bed, I would like to be able to say to myself something that would remind me of why getting out of bed is not a loving choice. I know that getting up to get more snacks would deprive me of many good things in my life, like health and happiness.
I want to feel lighter in my body and experience more freedom and joy. If this behavior, plus other things, helps change my weight, I think I'd be healthier because I wouldn't be carrying all this weight around on me.
I want to be healthy for my future grandchildren. I've started going to the gym, but I'm not sure if I'm making the progress I want.
I feel like I don't have enough energy to spend time with my grandchildren and I want to be able to carry them around and just have more energy overall.
I want to lose weight to feel lighter, have more energy to carry my grandchildren, and model better eating habits for them. I have life-altering reasons for losing weight, and I'm committed to reading my reasons list every morning. However, I need to work on not eating in bed, which is a long-standing habit.
I'm not a morning person, so when I wake up, I'm already tired, which is not a good start to the day. My daily routine consists of going to class, working in undergrad admissions on campus, being involved in my Filipino club, and coming home late. I often feel like I'm not prioritizing correctly and focus more on club business instead of my schoolwork. When I don't do well on exams, I feel upset that I don't care.
I am part of a Filipino club that brings me happiness, but my mom thinks I am coming home late and not doing my homework. She feels like I am only focusing on club activities.
I felt myself getting physically upset while talking about certain feelings. When discussing these feelings, I even felt like I wanted to cry, which has made me realize that I need to talk to someone about these things.
Lately, my partner and I haven't been communicating well. This feels more hurtful than when we used to fight because at least then, we were communicating in some way. It reminds me of a time when we fought a lot while I was struggling with pre-med.
I feel like there's a constant push and pull between wanting freedom from my mom and wanting to be close to her. I'm overwhelmed by emotions of disappointment and guilt regarding our relationship. I try to put her needs above my own, but sometimes this leads to counterproductive actions.
Sometimes I want my independence and to stay out late without my partner texting me all the time, but I also don't want her to feel worried. I have conflicting feelings that I can't articulate well.
I've been to counseling twice to talk about my feelings and to understand myself better. There are a lot of factors going on behind my decision-making, particularly my mom and my family. I just live with my mom, my dad passed away a few years back but they were divorced when I was younger. It was a messy divorce and we were estranged from him. His death was another affair, and I feel as though a lot is expected of me.
I feel like I'm constantly disappointing my mom, even though she has done so much for me and has gone through a lot of negative things. I don't want to cause her more pain, but it seems like I do anyway, and it hurts me.
I had a weird day, and it's a very stressful week because there's a lot going on. My Filipino club has an event this weekend, and I'm one of the forerunners of this event. I've been planning for weeks and feel like I've got no sleep so my stress level is very high. On top of that, I think I'm going to get my period, which makes me feel emotional.
I'm a third-year undergrad student at NYU and I recently switched from pre-med to a Psychology major, with plans to go into nursing. Although I initially thought I was at peace with my decision, it still bothers me when I'm alone. I went through a tough time last semester, realizing that I wasn't happy in pre-med but was afraid of disappointing my mom. I went to counseling, and my guidance counselor encouraged me to talk to my mom, who turned out to be supportive.
I can't help but feel like a failure. It feels as if I wanted to achieve something but couldn't. My guidance counselor said it's not that I'm stupid and that it's okay, but I still have those feelings in the back of my mind. My mom says she's proud of me and supportive of my decision, but I feel like deep down she is disappointed.
I feel like I have to act a certain way in front of people, and it's difficult for me. I trick myself into thinking I'm happy or proud when I'm actually sad. I've been bottling up these feelings for a long time, so it feels strange and vulnerable to talk about them. I also have trouble articulating my feelings, which is frustrating.
I am an only child, and I think that adds on even more stress because I feel as though I'm the only one my mom has. Most of our family still lives in the Philippines, and I feel like she is lonely. I feel a lot of pressure to not disappoint her and I don't want to make her go through any negative feelings. I feel like I owe her a lot because she sacrificed so much and works all the time because of me.
I feel like she doesn’t give herself a lot of time and doesn’t take care of herself. All her focus is on me, and I do appreciate that, but in some ways, it gives me a lot of stress.
I don't talk to people much about how I feel and what's going on. So I guess I bottle things up a lot. When I actually do talk to someone or someone is willing to listen, everything just kind of waterfalls out. I think it's because my mom is that way.
I have this idea that I don't want to seem like I'm lacking in any way because that reflects back on to my mom and my family. We have this concept of shame that puts pressure on me.
I feel like it's somewhat my fault that my mother has gone through so many difficult experiences. I feel guilty for feeling sorry for myself, knowing she has gone through worse. Our relationship is filled with lots of emotions, and I just feel disappointed that it is what it is.
I feel like there is no freedom for either me or my mom since she's a single mom and I'm an only child. I think our relationship is lacking and could be much better, but I don't know when the shift occurred. I believe it happened gradually over time without me recognizing it.
Recently, I've been having issues with my mom. We don't fight that often, but we tend to ignore each other. We live in a small apartment and make sure to avoid each other, like when I'm in the living room, she stays in her room.
I eat three meals a day, but I've been trying to cut down because I find myself overeating. In terms of my energy level, I drink a lot of coffee to get through long classes, but I've been trying to swear off coffee.
I don't feel tired all day, but during the early afternoon, I know that I'm going to feel a bit exhausted. So, I just need a cup of coffee to feel better afterwards.
Because I don’t really like talking about my feelings it was hard at first, but it got better throughout because it seems as though I really didn’t need to talk about these things… so at the end of it, I feel… I feel a bit, I feel comfortable.
Lately, I've been feeling really tired and down. I just wish I could stay home and rest, but when I go to school and see my friends, I instantly put on a smile and become cheerful, even though I'm feeling down inside. It's like an on switch, and sometimes it surprises me how easily I can hide my true emotions.
I keep a mask on when I'm around people, but sometimes when I get home, I explode, and my mom and I get into a fight. It's the complete opposite of what I want. We used to be really close, but I feel like we've drifted apart over the years.
Lately, I've been feeling guilty about my relationship with my parents. I know it's natural for relationships to have ups and downs, but I can't shake the feeling that I should be a better daughter and that our relationship should be stronger.
I had a chance to talk to Sam about some things that I've been going through. I found it helpful to talk about my feelings regarding my younger sister getting married soon. Sometimes it can feel a bit embarrassing to admit that I'm not super excited for her.
I felt like such a bad person when I first realized my feelings, but having them framed in a developmental context helped me feel more normal. I think it's natural for these feelings to come up when I see someone else and hope to get married eventually.
I've been trying to think about the things that I value and why I'm having an internal response like this. We talked about it in terms of the divorcing of things in my heart and things in my head.
Sometimes, the things I know and the things I believe don't always agree with what I feel.
Lately, I've been trying to remind myself that my life is going in the direction it's supposed to, and I'm hoping that helps me feel better eventually.
Recently, I've been going through a tricky situation and I've been working hard on both my life and the situation. But I still feel uncertain about it. Is there anything I can take away from this experience to help me moving forward?
I really feel better about the whole situation with my sister after talking about it. I found it helpful to let go of my grudge and remember that my life has meaning and value, even if it doesn't take the direction I think it will. I believe that my life would not be lonely and meaningless.
I was single my whole life, and I'm just trying to figure out how to deal with it and remember who I am.
I'm 27 and lately, I've been feeling a bit uneasy about my age. I wonder where I am in life and if I will get to where I want to be. Sometimes, I try not to think about it, but it's hard not to.
I sometimes wonder if I will feel fulfilled in my life especially when it comes to relationships. I look at some of my older, unmarried friends and see that they have meaning and purpose in their lives, which is somewhat comforting.
I'm happy for my older sister who is becoming a mom, but I'm struggling to feel excited for my younger sister who is getting engaged soon. I feel like I should be getting married before her, but it's not happening.
I feel like my friends seem to find fulfillment and meaning in their lives by investing time into activities and having a spiritual foundation. These relationships are mainly formed in church settings. I'm just not sure how I can find that same sense of fulfillment and meaning in my own life.
I have a belief that my life will take the path it's supposed to take, and if I'm meant to get married, it'll happen according to God's plan. In the past, this belief has provided me comfort during tough situations.
I sometimes find it hard to believe that my life has the same kind of meaning and value as I can easily see in other people's lives. I guess it's true for me as well, but it's difficult to accept for myself.
I am struggling with the idea of not having a family and trying to convince myself it would be okay. I think I would focus on my job, hobbies, and friendships to find meaningful pieces in my life. My heart feels ready to commit to marriage and live with someone, but the realization of not having a family is hard for me when my sister just had a baby.
I've always tried to be an independent person, moving away from home and establishing meaningful relationships in new places. But sometimes I feel like I'm battling between my desire for independence and the desire for marriage or close friendships.
I had a conversation recently that was not judgmental at all, and it made me feel really safe and at ease. I feel comfortable being here and talking about it.
I was almost surprised that I feel a lot better having talked to him. Not that this is a huge, huge deal, but I...
I have been feeling like I need to think about and work through my issues more, but I feel like I have a good foundation to move forward. My burdens feel lighter, but there was one thing that I wished was addressed during our conversation about my belief that my life is going to go the way it goes and where that belief comes from.
I was surprised that my past didn't come up during our conversation, but I felt it was resolved within me. I found it helpful when the counsellor repeated what I said, making me hear my own thoughts back, which felt affirming, although I can't pinpoint why exactly.
I am feeling unsure about something, but I am not clear about what exactly is bothering me.
I guess because I am alive, my life has meaning. Even if certain things, like marriage or a job, don't work out perfectly or as I envisioned, it will still be a valuable life.
I am struggling with living in the present, but I do find some meaning in my life and there are things I like about it. However, I am still troubled by the uncertainty and my sister's condition.
I have been struggling with my feelings about my sister's upcoming marriage. It's important for me to get past my own struggles with this, and I really want to be able to freely express how excited I am for her.
I have this friend who things seem to be going really well for, and I am kind of holding a grudge against her because of that. It's hard for me to feel joyful for her success.
I think I'd feel kind of fake if I try to fake my way through of being happy, but I feel like I'd miss out on something.
I feel that there is a difference between the feminist movement and my experience as a Black woman because the movement tends to view men as oppressors. However, I don't see Black men as my oppressors.
I feel like the White male has a more dominant character in society, and they're more likely to be my oppressor. It's not that I hate or dislike them, but just a realization of who might be saying I can't do something. What hurts me the most is when a Black male feels intimidated by an educated Black woman like myself.
I am majoring in psychology, and I'm very interested in humanities. That's the reason I am focusing on racial issues.
I think that maybe the difference in our generations has a lot to do with the issue, as I wasn't raised during the Civil Rights Movement or anything like that. I was a baby when Martin Luther King was in Washington. So the Black issue is a lot more subtle now.
As a Black woman of Afro-Caribbean descent, I have been thinking about how feminist issues affect us. I don't necessarily label myself as a feminist but agree with many of the standards associated with it. I've always stood up for equal treatment and held others accountable for infringing upon my dignity and self-esteem. By the time the feminist movement got going, I had already been on that path for a long time.
I've been thinking about my definition of feminism, and it made me reflect on my upbringing by Caribbean parents. In the Caribbean, it's quite natural for a woman to become a doctor or a lawyer, and my parents raised me in that culture.
As a patient, I struggled with coming to terms with living in the United States and being told that, as a Black woman, there were certain places I couldn't go easily. The feminist movement was intriguing to me because it stood up for justice and against the injustices I faced based on my gender and race.
I have worked mostly in predominantly White environments, and from my personal experience, the Black male has not been an obstacle for me. However, I also believe that they do not get off scot free and have their own sort of chauvinistic code. The Black family, in general, has always had this strong mother figure. I find it difficult to see my own mother as oppressed because she's handled the most difficult family situations with great tact.
As a patient, I feel a sense of oppression from both white women and white men due to my past experiences with them. My mother was a domestic worker, and they didn’t give her social security or good work situations. I find it difficult to simply buy into feminist movements without considering my personal experiences with race and oppression.
As a patient, I'm facing some experiences of subtle racism and issues of feminism in my daily life. People often refer to women as 'girls,' which I find disrespectful. I'm not fighting two separate battles, but rather I'm dealing with a covert form of racism, unlike the overt racism faced by previous generations, like my mother's.
I was raised by Afro-American parents, with my mother being the one setting the philosophy of our family. She believed that education was the key to freedom and encouraged us to be independent and self-managing. She had concerns about marriage, implying that she might have made different choices herself. I grew up thinking that being aggressive was necessary for survival, especially as a woman and Black person. Now, I struggle to see Black males as primary oppressors, but I acknowledge their actions can be oppressive.
I guess I have this fear of being alone and I would like to learn how to feel better about it, but I am not sure if I can. I believe that becoming more comfortable with being alone would make me feel less needy in relationships and not take a failed relationship as a personal failure.
I could be alone, without always searching for someone to complete me. If I made this growth and achieved this goal, I would describe myself as self-assured. I'd feel good about myself and capable of doing anything, like going to a restaurant or a movie by myself. I suppose I would feel more confident.
I've been feeling less afraid recently, and there was a brief moment when the idea of overcoming my fear seemed possible and it sounded great.
I'm worried about being alone. It's very scary for me, especially during big holidays. I think I'm just searching for someone who will be there for me because I don't want to feel lonely and sad.
I feel scared and lonely, and I think I need a boyfriend to feel better about myself. I don't want to be the only one without a partner at a dance. I feel like having a boyfriend would make me more likeable. This fear of being alone makes me always seek relationships and try to avoid being alone.
I feel that my relationships with men are impacted by my fear of being alone, as I think they can sense my fear somehow. I have never had a relationship that worked, and I'm afraid it's because of this.
I want to feel connected, but I seem a little bit uneasy today and I'm not sure why.
I've never been really good with this body, kinds of things, but I think I'm feeling something in my throat and around my chest.
I feel almost like I'm choking when I focus on my throat.
I'm really nervous about doing things on my own now, and I tend to avoid them. I would like to be able to go out on my own more instead of having to wait and lose the opportunity. Also, in relationships, I feel like I'm too needy, and I've been told that I'm suffocating my partners. I always want to know where my boyfriend is.
I just want to stay connected to people, and when we're out of touch for a long time, I feel disconnected. I begin to worry that maybe he's not interested in me anymore and that's why he's not calling.
I feel proud that I'm interested in my partner and want him to be interested in me. I think it's a good sign and I want to focus on the positive aspects of wanting to feel connected with someone I'm in a relationship with.
Lately, I've been self-questioning and struggling with decision-making, especially regarding my acting career. I've been trying to figure out whether acting is right for me and if I can endure the lifestyle that comes with it. I'm confused and worried about whether I can handle the challenges and if it's worth it.
I have to make a decision about my career. I want to be an actress, and I've already applied to the University of Iowa. I really like the University of Michigan, but I can't stay there if I want to be an actress.
I've been trying to decide whether I'm really fit for an actress's life or not because when I intended to be an English major and pursue writing. It's completely different because making decisions in acting affect other people, and I'm not sure if I want to live an actress's life. I'm used to a certain lifestyle, and the decisions make me feel hurried.
I used to have someone that I could look to, to bounce my ideas off them, and to help me make decisions. But now I'm stuck without anyone like that and feeling lost. I want to be an actress and I've applied to the University of Iowa, but I'm not sure if it's the right decision. I like the University of Michigan, but I can't stay there if I want to be an actress.
I was really afraid and still am afraid of not being able to go back to where I left off if this decision isn't right for me. I always worry about losing time and getting behind. Making decision to go to Cambridge to study English Literature and skipping the opportunity to study acting there has been a big step for me. I like the University of Michigan but the Acting Program isn't what I'm looking for.
I've been struggling with decision-making in various aspects of my life, like whether to go to Cambridge, pursue acting, or move to Michigan. It just feels like everything in my life comes back to the question, 'How do I make a decision?'
I am attracted to being on stage because of the success I've had in the past, the good feelings it brings, and the attention I receive. However, I also feel the need to express myself in different ways that may not be possible in ordinary life or even a writer's life, especially when just starting out. I often daydream about becoming an artist and want to have a craft that I can call my own and truly immerse myself in.
I am not sure if I made the right decision to attend the University of Iowa for the theater arts program, as I really liked the University of Michigan, but they didn't have a strong theater focus. I am using this first semester as a trial to see if an acting career is a good fit for me. But I don't know if this experience can give me a taste of the real competitive world of acting.
I feel like talking to you has lifted a weight off my shoulders, and now I can focus on other things in my life.
I find it really hard to see my strengths and resilience, especially when negative thoughts take over. Some guys have asked me out in the past, but I always had my boyfriend and never thought about other guys.
Now that I'm reflecting on my previous relationship, I believe I need someone who doesn't talk to me the way my ex did, someone who listens to me and truly cares about me. I think that's important for my next relationship.
I've been trying to do more activities to take my mind off my recent breakup. It's painful, but I think it's getting easier for me. I hope so.
I found it really hard to talk about my issues at first, but after opening up, it feels good to get things off my chest. It's comforting to know that you understand what I'm saying because you've had similar experiences.
I didn't want to talk to anyone about my feelings before but now that I have, it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Talking about it has helped me start to move past it.
I've been feeling better when I talk about things because I used to keep everything inside. I'm starting to learn that I can't do that anymore, as keeping things inside makes everything worse and eats away at me.
I am feeling depressed and I seem to focus only on negative aspects of myself, other people, and my future. For example, when I applied for a job, I didn't get it and started to feel really down, thinking I'm not smart enough and ignoring other good things like the possibility of getting a different job.
I feel like I'm looking at everything in a negative way right now, and I can't help it. It just naturally happens. I don't know how to change that or look at things in a better way than I am.
As a patient, I'm struggling with negative thoughts and I'm having a hard time identifying them and understanding how they're affecting me.
I was in a relationship that didn't make me feel good, but it was hard because it made me feel like I had someone. He didn't treat me great, which hurt my self-esteem, but it was more about the idea of him not wanting me anymore that made me feel bad.
I've been in this relationship where sometimes he made me feel good and I liked being around him, but other times he made me feel really bad. My friends and other guys who want to date me seem to enjoy my company, and I don't have the same concerns about myself when I'm with them. However, I found it hard to get out of the relationship I was in and felt stuck.
I feel like I'm not pretty enough, and that's maybe why my boyfriend broke up with me. I also think I might be boring and not entertaining enough. I'm worried that people find me dull, and my boyfriend didn't have a good time around me.
I've been feeling stuck and not good enough lately, especially when I think about why my ex-boyfriend might have broken up with me. I worry that he thinks I'm boring, but when I'm with my friends, I don't feel as boring. I don't know why, but sometimes I didn't feel as good about myself when I was with him.
I just thought that he would change the way he treats me because if he did, we could have an awesome relationship. I thought he was going to get better and start respecting me more, but it just never happened.
I've been working hard to gain someone's approval, but it's causing me to rely on them for how I feel about myself. I want to be able to feel good about myself regardless of what they think about me.
I guess and like the grand scheme of everything. He's just one guy and there's a lot more people out there and a lot of other people out there. It's just we were together for so long, it's just hard to focus on that sometimes you know.
I want to decrease the number of fights that I get into, but I don't really know what's going to happen.
I feel uncertain about the future, and I might get into fights if someone talks bad about my mom. That's probably the only reason I would fight.
I feel really hurt when I get into a fight with somebody, but I don't always fight in tough situations. I haven't figured out any way to feel good without getting into a fight.
I don't usually get upset with my close friends even when they joke about my mom. But when someone I don't know starts talking about my mom, that upsets me.
I get good grades and when I finish school, I want to play baseball. I believe I am good at it.
I got the MVP award two years in a row, and I went to the all-star game for both of those years. I usually play as the pitcher and center field. I worked hard to get where I am. My brother used to be the coach of the team.
I have a good relationship with my coach from the Park Forest League. He really pushed me to become a better athlete, and I like everything as it is right now.
I don't really want to challenge anything, but I guess I don't fight that much. If my mother was here, she'd probably say everything is okay, but there's room for improvement in my relationships with people.
I think my mom believes I should stop playing around so much. She thinks I goof around too much, both at school and at home, and sometimes it gets me into trouble.
I have a friend who lives quite far from here, about a 45-minute drive without snow. I talk to him on the phone every now and then, but it's not the same as seeing him in person. He knows that I want to spend more time with him.
I find it difficult to connect with my father, even though we talk on the phone every week. Seeing him face-to-face is quite different and I wish he could visit me more often.
I have a brother who is 24 years old and my sister is currently doing her residency. There's also my friend, but I'd like to know what you think about my brother.
I've been friends with Don since the fourth or fifth grade, but lately, I haven't been going over to his house that much.
When I hang out with my friend, we usually play basketball at his own court and then watch TV together. But it has been two months since we last did that.
I recently expressed my concerns about confronting someone who has angered me. I said that I might look like a goof if I tried to communicate my feelings like I do during our counselling session. I don't think it would be easy to handle the situation in real life.
I'm struggling with expressing my feelings when I'm upset with someone, especially in the moment. I can probably say it later, but not right away.
When my partner and I get into an argument, I try to talk to her just 20 minutes later, but she is still upset and talking doesn't seem to work. I can't picture myself saying a one-liner when I'm mad.
Lately, I've been struggling to communicate my feelings effectively, especially when I'm angry. But when I'm calm, I can sometimes picture myself saying something like that.
I've been able to complete the tasks given to me, and it's not really difficult. However, when we become louder and disruptive in class, the teacher would ask somebody to go in the hallway for a while or get a drink of water to calm down.
I've been pushing myself to do well in Algebra and I'm hoping that doing well in this class will help me improve in my other classes as well. If I can do well in Algebra, I think it will boost my confidence to perform better in all other subjects.
I want to get better grades, but I'm not sure how hard it is to work hard between now and a week-and-a-half.
I've been thinking about how my performance in school compares to sports. I recently heard that if you bat 333 in baseball, you're considered a superstar. I'm wondering why the same rule doesn't apply when it comes to my grades.
I have been spending most of my nights just lying in my room watching TV and sometimes studying Algebra. I usually do my homework at 6:30 because I like to watch the Simpsons beforehand.
I usually study early in the evening, because at 9 o'clock I'm probably out doing activities like going to the movies or bowling. I really want to get a B in this subject because the better my grades, the more things my mom will do for me.
I am putting a lot of pressure on myself to get good grades because my mom really values them. If I get straight C's, she'll be somewhat supportive, but if I get straight A's, she'll go above and beyond for me. I'll give my best on the days I don't have much homework besides Algebra, but when I have multiple assignments, it's hard for me to maintain the same energy.
I feel like I can work harder to be a B player, but I am stuck at the C level just getting by. I know the stuff, but I can't seem to push myself further.
Today, I came for a counselling session and the weather was snowy outside. I met my counsellor, Bob, and we greeted each other. I am feeling fine.
I didn't really know what to expect when I came here today and didn't know there was going to be taping.
I worked at Wendy's and I was trying to buy a go-kart for the summer so that my friends and I would have something to play with instead of just sitting in the house all day.
I recently started working at a new job and it's pretty fun. I work at the front cash register, so I get to meet the public a little bit.
As the patient, I mentioned that a lot of people come in.
I think my professor is just hyping up our final exam to make us study more. I believe that if I do 70 to 75 percent of the work, I can pass the exam. I don't want to gamble on it being easy.
I'm worried about my performance in school, especially when unexpected challenges come up. I am only able to do 80% of the work properly, and if I get thrown a curveball, I might be messed up.
I've been struggling with preparing for a curve in my life, but I plan to do more work, study, and fall back on the skills I already have. I believe that once I sit down and start working, I'll end up doing it for longer than I initially planned, maybe even 30 minutes.
I am struggling with studying for my exam. If I study for 30 minutes, I feel that I could get a B on the exam, but if I only study for 20 minutes, I'll probably end up getting a C plus or a C.
I have been practicing for 20 minutes every day, but I feel like it may not be enough to make me a better player. I am currently a C player but want to become a B player.
I see something where cars are, it has four wheels and it's really big.
I have this two-seater thing, kind of like the backseat of a car, and there's a cage on top for someone to sit. Is it an exciting ride?
I have a small vehicle with an engine in the back, probably 9 horsepower. It operates similar to a lawnmower and has a pull-start mechanism. My mother is okay with me having this vehicle.
I talked to someone who said they will help me if I save $500, and then they will cover the rest of the expenses. However, I think the only reason they said that is because they don't believe I can save that amount of money.
Lately, I've been having some arguments with my mother but most of the time we're doing fine.
I've been struggling with maintaining good grades and saving money. I often end up spending a lot on unnecessary things, which leaves me without enough money for what I really need.
I've been struggling with my grades lately, and my mom doesn't want me to work if my grades aren't good. If my grades start to fall, I won't be able to work, which is stressful for me.
I have been working on my self-control and saving money for a go-kart I want. My grades are pretty good right now, but I sometimes struggle with impulse purchases when I see something that I really like. However, when I think about the go-kart, I can resist the temptation to buy other unnecessary items.
As a patient, I recently bought a go-kart that cost me $849. It's a long, blue kart with a cage on the top, and it has dog paw prints on it.
I recently got a dirt bike with an outline of white. I'm excited because I live in East Gate, right in front of a big field where I can ride it. I've even talked to the police officers, and they said I can ride it back there, just not on the main streets.
I think if I come home with a B in Algebra, my mom would probably smile, give me a hug, and tell me I did a good job. It would make me laugh and smile with her.
I would be happy, and I think I'd feel a sense of joy and pride if that's possible.
I want to get a good grade on my final exam, and I understand that it will require studying and working hard. But I'm not sure exactly how to manage my time and efforts effectively to become a B Algebra player by the end of the semester. What should I do between now and then to achieve my goal?
I want to do all my homework assignments, be in class every day, and get good grades. I am able to do the homework assignments; they are not very hard for me. Tonight, I plan to do my Algebra homework and work on my Business Concepts.
I've been struggling with my Algebra homework and I'm considering working on it tonight. I think I would spend about 20 minutes on it.
I want to have better grades and test scores, but sometimes I put all my A energy into the work and my B energy into doing that.
I feel like I don't really have enough energy to do both tasks at 100%. I want to be able to say that I tried my best and got the grade that I deserve.
I have two sisters, and while my relationship with one of them is perfect, I have some issues with the other one.
I am having trouble with achieving my goals like getting good grades and obtaining a go-cart. We discussed three main things – getting what I want, the work, the go-kart, and grades.
I have been having difficulties getting along with my sister and my mother. When I get mad, I don't know how to handle it. Do you have any suggestions on how to communicate better when I am upset?
I find it difficult to make some changes in my life, and I think it could take me about a month and a half to really build up the courage to do something new.
I'm worried about my grades, specifically for my last test. If I can get a B on it, I might be able to get a B or B- in the class overall for the final.
As a patient, I'd like to mention that I feel the B player is better than the C player based on their performance. They are more aggressive, better at hitting the ball, catching and fielding. Additionally, they have a better batting average.
As a patient, I am trying to understand the difference between a B Algebra player and a C Algebra Player. From what I know, a B player probably got better grades on their tests and did all their homework and stuff.
I want to improve my algebra skills to at least be a B level student. I think I should study more, pay attention in class, and not talk so much.
I sometimes feel pressured by my mom's expectations for my grades. She works hard all day and I try to do a lot of things for her as well. It seems like she wants me to get a B or higher.
I have a friend who is always joking around, but he sometimes gets an attitude when he doesn't like the way people talk or when they start talking crazy, like running their mouth about things they don't know what they're talking about.
I haven't been in any problematic situations recently, but I did get into a fight about a month ago. People around me sometimes say crazy stuff, but it hasn't happened in the last couple of days.
I had an argument with my friend over some silly stuff, and they called me stupid. Then, after school, we fought and started cussing and talking crazy.
I have this friend with whom I fought a while ago, then we became friends again after two months. However, we just had another fight a month ago. Honestly, I don't get into fights that often, maybe just about once a month.
As a patient, I want to share that I am experiencing some issues that seem to occur every two months, roughly.
I feel upset to think that when somebody disrespects my mother, it directly affects me as well. It's all about respect for me, giving and taking it. At the same time, there are people around me who I want to improve my relationship with.
I don't really see my brother-in-law much now because he got a job in the city. We used to hang out together everyday and play basketball.
I get along with my friend, but I don't see him as often as I'd like to. My sister is about to have a baby and she's in the city for her residency as a doctor.
I usually don't get into fights, but there was this one time I got into a fight with my friend. I feel like it's not a big deal if I don't know them too well, but it's about respect.
As a patient, I feel like getting respect is important, but I'm not sure if I need to fight for it. I think if I carry myself in a certain way, like not picking fights or always trying to beat up others, I can still get respect. But I wonder if it's possible to get respect without fighting?
I am struggling with the idea of maintaining respect by not engaging in fights, even though I feel like most people can't really defend themselves. My mother is also a factor to consider.
I don't know what my friend would say if she were here, but I think she wouldn't want me fighting over petty stuff. She would probably say there's nothing else I can really do.
I goof around a lot at school, but I don't do it that much at home. At school, I'm around all my friends, so it's different than being at home where I only have three friends living nearby.
I'm having fun and goofing around in school, but maybe I should change that. Even my algebra teacher wants me to pay more attention in class.
I have an Algebra final exam coming up. However, I think it's going to be easy because we never have homework in that class, and the teacher usually shows us examples on the board.
Today, my cousin, my friend, and I were talking in class, and our teacher got kind of mad at us when we continued to talk after finishing our work. We just needed 15 more minutes to be done with our conversation.
I've been struggling with my grades. In the first quarter, I got a C plus, but now I have a C. I am passing, but I feel like I could do better.
I feel hesitant to brag about myself, even though I know I'm a good person who cares about others. I'm worried that even with all my positive qualities, I might not do as well as I'd like.
As a patient, I feel that I've always set a really high standard for myself, and it's been very stressful for me during my undergrad. I was so focused on getting A's and being the top student in the class, which was a lot of work, that I'm worried about experiencing the same stress again.
Well, I think I can manage my academics and the application round, but I'm worried about maintaining a work-life balance, as I'm poor and have to work and pay for school while dealing with the pressures.
I struggle with self-doubt and negative thoughts, especially when it comes to applying to grad school. I often forget about my good qualities and achievements, like going to community college and excelling in school after focus. I want to learn how to focus on the positive things in life and not let negative thoughts consume me.
I really want to pursue grad school, but I'm undecided about whether I want to do social work or continue psychology. I'm hesitant because I fear that I might not be good enough and might not have what it takes to get my master's degree. I had a good GPA in college, graduated cum laude, did a lot of extracurriculars, and have experience working with people doing HIV testing and counseling.
I'm wondering how long the therapy process takes. Is it just a few weeks or does it last for years? I've heard that some therapy can last for years, so I'm curious about the duration.
So this week, I think if I have time tomorrow, I think I could definitely not only maybe write some stuff for my personal statement or at least organize my ideas, but start applying for community college. I feel that I've always needed somebody to push me.
While I was talking to my friend, and she's doing her, her MPH or she's gonna do it. And she just kind of said she would help me, and just to call her and let her know and that we'll sit through like show, like be there, 'cause she kind of knows how I am. So she said like, if I call her, she will, like come get me, and we'll, we'll work on the application stuff together. So just maybe giving her a call and see what time she has, so we can kind of do it together.
I'm applying to community college to complete prerequisites and I've started mapping out what I want to say in my personal statement. I could probably start a draft and since I have a day off tomorrow, I plan to work on it.
I'm planning to spend tonight calling my friends. Tomorrow on my day off, I want to start putting my ideas on paper for my personal statement and work on organizing it. I think I need to act quickly on looking into the community college and checking the prerequisites since the spring semester is starting soon.
I am nervous about this therapy session as I've always worried that therapists and counselors might psychoanalyze or judge me. However, I am excited and hope to discover my sense of wellness.
I think for me, my goals would be just to have more confidence in myself to really know like or be able to fully grasp my capabilities because I know I'm capable of a lot of things but I just don't always believe that, I think. So it's just really to have more confidence in myself. I know it can be really hard on myself and sometimes not feel worthy of things and I just would love to be able to again it goes back to that to believe that I'm worthy of certain things.
I think maybe I do things to prove to other people that I'm good enough and that I'm worthy. I need to do it for myself. I think the first steps for me right now would be just to apply to a community college to do my pre-reqs as a way to save money. Once I get in, I will make sure I prepare for the grad program that I want to apply to.
Last time we talked, I didn't achieve my goal because I kept telling myself that I might not have enough time for my application process.
I remember being scared when I first met my grandmother when I was around four years old. I was afraid of her and didn't want to be around her. Another influential memory I have is from second grade when my teacher praised me for my vocabulary and schoolwork, making me feel good about myself.
I think for me, like maybe a little later on in life, probably when I was in elementary to middle school, I was bullied a lot. There was a lot of negative self-talk from people. And I would sometimes remember that teacher telling me that I was smart, had good vocabulary, and did really well in school. It helped me feel better when I felt badly about myself.
I'd be so happy and feel really proud of myself if I got into grad school. People have told me that I underestimate my own worth and capabilities. If I could really believe in my worth and accomplishments, it'd be such an amazing feeling.
I was feeling pretty bad when I came in, and I felt like I disappointed you or even myself because I didn't apply or at least really look into it. But right now, it actually feels good. I don't know, I always feel like a little bit of hope and motivation. So I feel motivated too.
I kind of feel a little bad just because I know we talked about maybe beginning for me to try to apply or just the process and I didn't. And I'm kind of… I guess I beat myself up for not doing that. So I was just kind of… I've been feeling a little bad lately about that.
I have applied for something and I'm not worried about it, which seems unusual for me. What would it look like for me if everything goes well?
I've received a lot of negative feedback in my life, particularly from a teacher who criticized my handwriting. That experience has stayed with me, and it's been hard to find encouragement since then. Recently, my high school English teacher praised my vocabulary and writing, but it was a rare positive moment for me.
When I was working at a drive-through, a customer refused to leave until I promised him I would go to college. At the time, I just said yes to get him out of the line. But a year or two later, I started seriously thinking about going to college and remembered his words.
I feel overwhelmed by school, social life, and the pressure I put on myself. I worry that this might affect my success and ability to achieve my goals. I've experienced bullying and felt worthless, but I'm good at academics. So I feel like I need to be perfect in that area to make up for the bad stuff.
I've always been bullied and teased for being too sensitive and kind, as it didn't really fit into the stereotype of how a man or boy is supposed to be. I was made to feel less than because I didn't embody the typical male characteristics.
I remember an experience from kindergarten that wasn't too pleasant for me. I felt like I wasn't as good as the other kids because of my handwriting, and I thought there was something wrong with me.
Lately, I've noticed that I tend to keep people, especially romantic partners, at arm's length. I put up a lot of walls and find myself distrustful in relationships.
I think once I start thinking or feeling that negative feeling, I could maybe tell myself to stop and try to recognize it. Then, I would think about all the stuff that I've achieved so far, because it tends to take the back burner for me. I want to focus on that and maybe fixate on it.
I often struggle with negative thoughts about myself, but I'm starting to realize that I have many positive qualities as well. I've always worked hard, I'm kind, and I'm good with people. I've done well in school and have a lot of experience helping people in the community. I believe that if I really try, I can achieve my goals.
I feel immature for seeking reassurance to make decisions about my life. I want to take more risks and be honest with my children, even if it's uncomfortable. I feel stuck between being honest and respecting my own values. I lied to my daughter a month ago and it has been bothering me. I want to become more accepting of myself.
I do feel relieved now that my previous issue is solved, even though I didn't directly resolve it. I also feel like you are not giving me advice, but rather supporting me in the decisions I want to make. It seems like you're encouraging me to follow my own path.
I've been feeling a mix of rebellion and desire for acceptance from my father. I wrote him a letter telling him I'm a waitress, expecting disapproval, and it felt like revenge. I want him to accept and love me for who I am, but when I try to communicate my love, he doesn't seem to hear me.
I don't know what it is. When I talk about it, it feels more flip. If I just sit still a minute, it feels like a great big hurt down there. That I feel cheated. I tried working on it, and I feel it's something I have to accept. My father just isn't the type of man I'd really like. I'd like somebody more understanding and caring. That is why I like substitutes, like talking to you and other men that I can respect.
I'm just newly divorced and I had gone in therapy before which made me feel comfortable. However, now the biggest change is adjusting to my single life, especially with men and having them over at the house, and how it affects my children.
I have a nine-year-old daughter and we have always been very open with each other, especially about sex. Recently, she asked me if I've ever made love to a man since leaving her father, and I lied to her. Now I feel guilty and I'm worried about affecting our relationship. I remember how I felt when I discovered my parents made love, and I don't want my daughter to feel the same way. Should I tell her the truth?
I have been struggling with my emotions and actions, especially in my relationships and parenting. I thought I had worked through most of my guilt, but I find myself feeling disappointed in myself lately. Whenever I do something impulsive, I feel comfortable until I remember how my childhood experiences affected me, then everything goes haywire.
I know the feeling within myself that occurs when I am really doing something that's right for me. But often I'll still go along with situations even if they don't feel right, hoping to remember for next time. When I follow my instincts, I feel a sense of utopia and wholeness that is precious to me, but I don't get that as often as I would like.
As I talk to you, I realize that I wish my father could have talked to me in the way you are doing now. I want your approval and respect, but it makes me miss the connection I couldn't have with him. I feel like he wanted me to be perfect and wouldn't listen to me the way you are.
I'm struggling with making decisions and feeling comfortable about them. There are times when I feel uncomfortable with my actions and experience guilt or conflict afterwards. For example, I've wanted to leave my husband for years, but I never did it. I'm not sure how to know when I am following my true feelings.
I remember my mom used to drink a lot, and it was really frightening for me. She would yell and scream, and I would try to help her and apologize for any mistakes I made, hoping to make her happy. But it never worked, and it still doesn't.
As long as I can remember, my mom was often drunk and not there for me. I had to get myself up for school and put on a happy face because I was embarrassed. I couldn't have friends over or stay at their places. When I was 14 or 15, I just left. But there were times when welfare would take me away and put me in foster care with total strangers, which was awful.
I was in foster care for a large part of my early life, and it was really difficult for me. I feel really angry and distressed about the experience, because those people were supposed to be taking care of me, but it seemed like a load of crap.
I'm feeling good after the activity we just did. It was relaxing and it reminded me of the time when I used to do this in rehab. We would do it in the mornings and before we finished our programs at night. I'd forgotten how helpful it was.
I find it easy to practice certain skills, but it's difficult when I'm on my own to do that. I don't feel okay very often, though.
As a patient, I used to practice relaxation techniques in rehab before I went to bed. Now that I'm not in rehab, I think I could try practicing it in the morning when I wake up, before I get up and maybe before having a joint.
I have been practicing when I haven't got anything on board, and I think I might be postponing putting something on board. I'm wondering if trying it even just for a few minutes could be helpful.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with life, and I don't know how to cope with all the stress. I find it hard to focus and be productive during the day, which only adds to my anxiety. Can you give me some advice on how to handle this?
I can just hear my mom's voice and it's causing me distress. I tried looking around the room and control my breathing.
Well, I sometimes have this little voice sort of over my shoulder that says all the things my Mum said, and I feel really bad about myself.
Lately, I have been feeling a deep sense of shame and embarrassment. There are times when I just want to hide away, stay at home, and avoid any interaction with others because I think no one would want to be around me.
I've been struggling with some tough feelings and I managed to stay with them for a while. We did some grounding and breathing exercises, but now I feel pretty spacey.
I might say that, like you mentioned, this has just become how it is all the time now for me.
Lately, I've been having these thoughts about being useless and it's been bothering me. I don't know how to put some distance between me and these thoughts.
I feel like, you know, I'm, yeah, I've got, I'm, I'm thinking that. Maybe just could see. I might like to try in a week and that's when we'll know.
I've been struggling with some negative self-talk lately. I keep telling myself that I'm useless because I haven't done a lot with my life. I also find myself repeating the harsh words my mom used to say to me. How can I stop this negative thinking?
I am anxious and trying some breathing exercises as guided by my counsellor. I am paying attention to each breath and becoming aware of how long it takes for each in breath and each out breath while breathing through my nose.
I am trying to practice deep breathing as guided by my counsellor, but I find it a bit difficult to do and feel a little dizzy when I start.
I've been trying to slow down and control my breathing as per your guidance. I have been maintaining silence and focusing on breathing in deeply, pausing, and then exhaling slowly.
I just finished practicing a breathing exercise with Dr. Ali Marsh. I opened my eyes and looked around the room, and she asked me how I was feeling after the exercise. I responded with a nod and a soft 'Mm-hmm', indicating that I was managing to get my breath deeper.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and struggling with managing my emotions.
As the patient, I am willing to try out new coping methods that the counsellor suggests. I am struggling with drug use and issues with my boyfriend.
My mom was, and still is, pretty hopeless. I've tried cutting her out of my life many times, but always end up going back. She's an alcoholic, and she was always drunk when I was little.
I feel like I can't breathe, and I think I'm going to die. I've tried going to the doctors and they just prescribe me benzos, but they don't help. When I'm not using them, I feel panicky and can't cope. Everything feels like it's closing in on me, and I can't think clearly.
It's just really hard to explain but it's like I said, it's like I'm having a nervous breakdown when I'm not using drugs. I try as much as possible not to use speed because it's difficult to get and expensive. But there are times when I just can't drag myself out of bed and being around people is hard, unless I have speed.
I use speed to give me energy and help me be around people. I also have pot every night to help me sleep and sometimes take pills when I can't sleep even with the pot, especially when I've had arguments or problems at work.
I've been feeling overwhelmed and I want to stop all the noise in my head.
I heard something about mindfulness on the radio the other day. Apparently, it's like the new big thing and some celebrity was being interviewed about doing it. But I didn't really pay much attention.
I feel like most people, including myself, spend a lot of time caught up in our own thoughts and feeling terrible. When we try to avoid feeling anything, we don't learn how to tolerate or handle emotional situations without getting upset.
I'm finding it difficult to accept my feelings, thoughts, senses, and bodily sensations without judging them or trying to push them away. The idea of mindfulness sounds a bit scary to me.
I am currently using mindfulness to manage less intense emotions and feelings. But when I feel overwhelmed, I tend to rely on grounding or sometimes drugs. I am learning to acknowledge my thoughts without judging them or pushing them away.
I've tried relaxation techniques in the past, but I can't seem to keep other thoughts from overtaking my mind. I find it really difficult to focus on the exercises.
I felt really sad because like, you know, I've never had anywhere like that.
Lately, I've been feeling extremely overwhelmed with work and personal life. I can't seem to find a balance between the two, and it's taking a toll on my mental health. I find myself constantly feeling exhausted, and I'm having trouble sleeping at night.
Lately, I've been using speed, hash, pills, and alcohol pretty much every day. When I can't get access to the usual drugs, I resort to buying Vodka or Gin to cope with everything. I've tried to stop several times before, but it's been really difficult for me.
I have been to many rehabs, tried detoxing myself at home, and have seen numerous counselors, but nothing has worked for me. I feel really desperate and at this point, I am starting to think that maybe I am useless and can't overcome this.
I just, I can't, I just can't function without out them, like. Um, every time I've tried to stop, it just, I feel like I'm going to have a break down. Like it's, well I have, I have had like nervous breakdowns.
As I was focusing on the air going in and out of my nostrils, I noticed different sensations like the cooler air coming in and the warmer air going out. However, as I tried to concentrate on this, various thoughts kept floating into my mind, and I found it hard to let them go and bring my attention back.
I tried the breathing exercise with my counsellor, but it was pretty hard for me.
I have been trying to practice mindfulness and focus on my breath, following the air as it goes in and out of my lungs. However, I often catch myself judging my thoughts, and it's challenging to let them go without feeling guilty.
I was feeling really stuck because I didn't want to use but I also didn't want to be on my own. I didn't know what to do, and then I fail again. I was angry at Joel for not supporting me when he said he would, and it seems like he never really understands how I feel.
I have been feeling let down recently, and it's making me really sad and angry. All I wanted was someone to help me, but instead, I ended up using with them, which made me feel like a loser. It's been so hard for me that I almost didn't want to come today.
I have been feeling like a failure, as I let myself down and let you down. Although I went a week without using speed, I still used pot, pills, and alcohol. I was really glad that I didn't use speed for 6 days.
I had a weird experience during the visualization exercise. When you mentioned that I could do something to make it safer, I felt a sense of safety and calmness.
I wasn't even thinking, but I got up and put a lock on the door right away so nobody else could come in. Otherwise, I couldn't relax as I was scared that someone might come in.
I recently put a lock on my door and felt good about it. It has given me a feeling of safety and relaxation in my personal space. However, I am worried because I'm able to concentrate on it only when someone is talking to me about it.
Every time I try to stop these destructive behaviors, I end up feeling lost and empty with no other way to manage my emotions. I would like to find other ways to cope.
I feel useless and like I've failed again due to my drug use. It has been doing some very important things for me, but it's not easy for me to stop. I'm just really tired of it and feel distressed.
I can't keep it up. It's just too hard, having it in my head all the time. I'm always thinking about when I will get the next one and which doctor will give me some pills. To get the money, I have to do things that make me feel terrible, and I feel like a bad person. I know it's not good, but why can't I just grow up and stop it? It's all-consuming, and I can't seem to have another life.
I was asked to imagine walking down a path in the bush, noticing the trees around me, the sound of my feet crunching leaves, the warm air, and the slight breeze. The sky was described as blue with a few small clouds, and I'm feeling better as I walk down this path.
As the patient, I'm in a guided visualization exercise where I see a large limestone wall with a door in it, and upon getting closer, I realize it's a doorway. After looking through it, I see a set of stone stairs leading down with a feeling that there is something very nice at the bottom of them. I start walking down the stairs.
I'm at the bottom of the stairs you guided me through and I feel great.
I see the lake, and I can hear the birds and ducks around me. I even noticed a mother duck with a few little baby ducks following her. There are so many ducks around the place, it's really calming and cute.
I am the patient and I find myself in a peaceful place with ducks floating around in the lake. As I look around, I find a nice spot under a tree to sit and enjoy the tranquility. Everything in this place feels amazing and I feel completely safe and at peace.
I was going to cancel today because I just feel so angry. I don't know if I'm angry at myself or at Joel. I remembered what you said, so I came. I always end up with these loser boyfriends. It means a lot that I'm coming here.
My boyfriend told me that he would support me in my recovery journey, and I was grateful for that. But last night, he suggested getting some speed and having a big night out. I felt like he said he was there for me, but then prioritized his own desires over my wellbeing.
Oh, I'm angry at the whole situation. It's so hard for me to trust, and I trusted him. Now, I'm really sad and feel like I had no choice but to be on my own.
I've tried this technique of creating a safe place in my imagination before, but I find it really hard to come up with a safe place.
I have participated in big group sessions before where I was left to find my own safe place, but it hasn't worked for me.
I was left alone and my thoughts started racing, making it difficult for me to find a sense of safety.
As the patient, I am willing to try different methods to find what works best for me, and I am ready to begin a relaxation exercise with closed eyes and deep breaths.
I've been having a hard time lately, feeling like I'm losing hope and that life is not worth living anymore. I really want to try and give it up.
I've tried so many times to change my drug use and get on with life, but it hasn't worked. I'm not really convinced that I can do it because I haven't succeeded in anything, so thinking I'm gonna be able to do this is pretty difficult for me.
I am feeling wobbly and not confident. Emotions are a difficult area for me. I feel overwhelmed, like I can't cope with things, and bad about myself most of the time. I have panic attacks, and feel like I am going to die. Also, I am confused about what it means to manage emotions.
Lately, I've been dealing with a mix of emotions, which include feelings of anger and being really stressed out.
I tend to dissociate from time to time, and it's difficult for me to handle it on my own. I usually just try to forget it because it's too overwhelming. The last time, you reminded me I was safe, and it seemed to bring me back.
I find it hard to stop when I'm on my own, and when I come out of it, I need to do something or have something to try and calm myself down.
At times when I'm, yeah. I'm in, when I was in rehab in the past they tried to do meditation stuff. And um, yeah, they said, to me that I wasn't very good at breathing. There's times when I just um, I just stop breathing. So now, I'm a bit, I sort of try and.
I don't remember how old I was when I first went into foster care and I just found myself dissociating during our session. I'm struggling to stay present and feel safe.
I am able to identify the colors in the paintings on the wall and the flowers in a jug, as well as noticing the trees and their leaves waving in the wind outside the window.
I was talking about my foster care experience and I suddenly felt overwhelmed with memories that I usually block out. It's too difficult for me to go there.
As a patient, I was working with Dr. Ali Marsh on a grounding exercise to help bring me out of my mind, memories, and feelings, and into the present moment. I think this is supposed to help me not be so focused on my thoughts and emotions.
I recently went 6 days without using drugs, which is a huge improvement for me. However, I have a hard time being alone and my partner knows it. We haven't discussed a plan for situations when I'm alone.
I didn't have a choice, and I've always believed that. My mom constantly said that I was just like a failure. I could never make her happy.
As a child, my mum constantly told me that I was a failure. I could never make her happy as I was making too much noise or not cleaning my room. I was always in the way when she wanted some man over. And now, I feel like I can't seem to make anyone happy.
I hadn't thought of that. I'm unsure about my current situation and how to deal with it.
During a therapy session, I was talking and got upset, then I dissociated. I did some grounding to come back into the room and into the present, but I still wasn't feeling very good.
I feel really spacey and that's why I usually go use because I feel really out of it.
I've been feeling spacey recently, and I just did a grounding exercise in the session today. We are at the end of the session, but my counsellor has given me a handout with different ways to do grounding. I'll take it with me and have a look at it.
I recently discovered the greenfield state, which is filled with pleasant sensations. I feel like remembering this state could help me feel better more often, but I'm surprised that I was able to experience it here in the office, and I wonder why I don't just spend more time in this state.
Since our last session, I've started noticing nice things about my work environment, like getting a cup of iced coffee before starting my work. It's helping me feel better and more capable in handling my tasks. Do you think entering my workplace in a better mood might impact my overall productivity?
When I'm overwhelmed, I wouldn't get much done in my workspace. I'd feel tense, physically stressed, and experience headaches. I wouldn't even give myself permission to take a minute and a half break to get an iced coffee.
I've recently experienced seeing a whole veil of purple whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed. Surprisingly, it seems to dissolve my stress, and I start to understand how people manage big, challenging tasks. When I'm in this relaxed state, I can see more possibilities and my body feels looser.
A couple of weeks ago, I had multiple projects within one week, and it was overwhelming. One day, I felt like my to-do list was too long, and I didn't know what would happen if I didn't finish everything. I also had a cup of coffee, which I don't usually drink. I had a flood of thoughts about the chain reaction of not getting things done, leading to potential problems in the future.
I enjoy quilting in my free time, especially making modern quilts. I started quilting a couple of years ago and learned from my mom and aunt who have been doing it for a long time. However, I don't have a quilting group right now, and my husband thinks I need one. A few months ago, I went to my friend's house for a mini quilting retreat for three days, but I don't get much time to quilt because I'm so busy.
I'm feeling really stressed with work and anxious. I know everyone handles a lot of different things at once, but I'm having trouble managing it all without feeling overwhelmed. When I get really anxious, my mind slows down, which makes me worry more about my ability to handle tasks.
I just got back from a walk, and when I returned to my home office, I felt like I took the first deep breath of the day. However, I usually don't like taking breaks because I lose track of what I'm doing. When I re-entered my office, my perspective seemed wider, and I noticed the green walls more, which I really enjoy.
I felt that everything seemed more doable when I walked in my office. I also made myself a caramel iced coffee from Starbucks, which is my guilty pleasure. I know I drink too much coffee, but I still wanted to make a nice one before going into my office.
I notice that just thinking about something overwhelms me and causes tension in my shoulders, shallow breathing, and the beginning of a headache. But, the other day I had to take the dog out and I ran into a neighbor. We had a conversation about landscaping, and it actually cheered me up and helped me break out of that gridlock.
I have been experiencing discomfort in my chest and upper body area. I noticed that my breathing has also changed, and I'm taking deep breaths. My face feels more relaxed and less tense.
I feel like my body is loosening up, and overall, I feel lighter, like I could defy gravity. This lightness makes me think of a butterfly. When I feel this way, the work that needs to be done seems reasonable, and I feel more capable of accomplishing things.
As a patient, I feel like I can do this and it's like nothing, almost like I could even do more. When asked about a color that comes up for me, I would say purple.
I discovered recently that when I'm feeling overwhelmed, taking a break and doing something simple like walking my dog can really help shift my mood. I was able to come back to my work with a fresh perspective and felt lighter, like I could defy gravity. I realized that sometimes I can switch from feeling overwhelmed to feeling more in control and capable. What can I take away from this realization to help me in the future?
I didn't even want to take the dog out when it needed to go to the bathroom because I felt overwhelmed with work and felt like I didn't have enough time for anything else. I feel like this overwhelm might be controlling and sabotaging me, preventing me from taking breaks or doing things that could help me recharge.
I often feel overwhelmed, which makes me anxious and unable to function properly. The what-if thoughts take over my mind, making me worry about the future and the people I work with. This overwhelm leads to physical symptoms like tense shoulders, shallow breathing, and headaches. It's getting in the way of my daily life, such as taking care of my dog.
I was feeling overwhelmed with the tasks I had to do, so I walked back into my home, went to my office, and noticed the green walls. I made myself a cup of iced coffee, and then I started questioning why I was so overwhelmed. So, I made a spreadsheet to assess all the projects I need to work on and the tasks associated with them. As a result, everything seemed more doable.
I have been feeling frustrated while talking to my family and friends about my grief. I lost my loved one in February, and I'm struggling to adjust through the stages of grief. I've been crying a lot, and it feels like it's hard to move forward.
I recently had a mini breakdown, but attending a convention with motivational talks and inspirational things helped refresh me. I'm also grateful for still being in school, as it keeps me going.
I find that school helps me because it forces me to focus on what I'm reading and what the professor is saying. Studying requires me to gather my thoughts and be present in the moment. I also appreciate talking to you about my issues since you're unbiased and not part of my family, allowing me to express myself freely.
I have been struggling with my grief and I'm trying to find ways to cope with it. I have been praying, going to church, and listening to others. I attended a GriefShare group a couple of years ago. Now, I am considering attending a grief group again as it might help me during this time.
I've been feeling powerless and helpless lately. I miss someone special in my life and these feelings have made me isolate myself. I don't want to be around people but I don't like being isolated either. However, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts.
I've been dealing with a lot of grief after experiencing a loss in my life. I've been isolating myself from my friends and family, partly because I know they don't fully understand the pain I'm going through. I don't want to keep explaining my feelings or talk about what happened, and I feel like they don't really get it.
I feel like others don't have that special connection I had with my sister and my son. It's difficult, but I know they love me.
I recently lost someone close to me and I've noticed that people around me seem to be moving on with their lives, while I'm still struggling with the loss. It's difficult to talk to them because they don't understand what I'm going through.
I have been really struggling after my sister's passing. It's hard for me because every time something happens, I break down thinking about her. I couldn't function properly, my thoughts were all over the place and I couldn't focus on my studies. I started counting the hours, days and weeks, just trying to survive. I lost interest in doing anything and didn't want to be around people.
Lately, I've been oversleeping and overeating. I've been able to maintain a relationship with my family, and they understand it's not personal. I'm just trying to keep myself going and functioning every day. I feel hopeless and helpless, constantly thinking about what I could have or should have done, even though I know the outcome wouldn't have changed.
I feel completely powerless. It seems like there was nothing I could have done in that situation, but a part of me keeps thinking that maybe I could have done something.
I'm here because I recently lost my sister. I had a breakdown last Saturday at a church event that reminded me of her. I was crying uncontrollably, and my husband tried to comfort me, but I decided I needed to see a professional.
I lost my younger sister recently. She went through a surgery and passed away unexpectedly due to septic shock. It's really hard for me to cope with this loss, especially because she was the youngest in our family. Just last week, I attended a church function and I couldn't help but break down crying.
I was in the car, listening to a conversation about women's health and empowerment, and it made me think about a friend who had passed away suddenly. It was hard for me to grasp that she couldn't be there to share those moments with me, and I wonder if those things could have helped her in her life, with her health and self-esteem.
Lately, I have been struggling with depression and anger after losing my sister. It's been a month, and I feel like everyone around me is expecting me to move on already. I am finding it difficult to cope and it's affecting my daily functioning.
As a patient, I am grieving the loss of my baby sister. She had a special meaning in my heart, and I wanted her to have a full life. I feel like, as an elder sister, maybe there was something I could have done to help her.
I feel like my friends and family don't understand the level of grief I'm experiencing and they avoid bringing it up, fearing they'll make me feel worse.
I wish I would have spent more time with her. And I wish that, you know, she would have communicated to me what was going on with her. I was angry, angry not at her, but at the situation that, you know, I won't be left out and I won't have the chance, you know, to help her or see her.
I don't know, I just felt like I should have been more attuned with what was going on with her even though she was telling me everything was all right. I know they are not right thoughts, but that's just the way I'm thinking.
Lately, I have been feeling more and more anger, and I think it's because I feel powerless. I also feel some guilt, as if I could have done something to prevent it.
I had a close connection with my sibling, which made our bond really special. I always hear about people who don't have this kind of connection, and it makes me grateful for what I had. My sibling had such a unique spirit, but the loss of them hurts so much.
I really appreciate the way my daughter loves people and enjoys being around them. Also, my son is a great jokester; he always used to make everyone laugh and could get away with anything because of his humor.
I have a big family with nine children. But I recently lost one of my children, and it has been really difficult for me to cope with this loss.
I have nine siblings, but I had a strong connection with one of them because we grew up together. Even though they are not the oldest, they were the first grandbaby in the house. Unfortunately, both of my close siblings passed away in hospitals, and I felt powerless in those situations which is making me sad and worried.
I feel angry, and I want to talk to the person who causes my anger. I think talking to her husband will help me, but I want to do it in a way where I'm helping.
I need to have a difficult conversation with someone, and I'm not sure how to approach it. We are both grieving over a shared loss.
I've been feeling a lot of grief lately, and I struggle to understand why my friend didn't share his feelings with me. I've tried going for walks and exercising to help cope, and I also pray.
As the patient, I've been practicing meditation and prayer, and I find it helpful. I also like to read inspirational thoughts and listen to things on the radio to keep me motivated. I plan to continue with these practices.
I tried journaling to express my emotions, but it's really hard for me. There are so many emotions and when I start to write, a lot of anger comes out on the paper which I don't like. I don't like being angry with people and when I see it written down, it's unsettling.
I am angry at some specific people for keeping something in front of me. I don't like being angry, but putting it down on paper doesn't resolve anything for me. I don't get any benefit from expressing it that way.
I have been feeling a lot of anger since my close one passed away. I have been seeing a counsellor at my school which has been helping me. I don't feel as angry and I've reached a point where I don't cry while talking about it. I'm just confused about why I feel anger when someone close to me passes away, and I wonder if I could have done something to help.
I lost my sister recently, and it has triggered the pain of losing my son ten years ago. I sought help two years ago when the pain felt unbearable, but now with my sister's death, I feel like I'm reliving that pain all over again.
I lost my son and sister 10 years ago, and the pain still feels very real. It's hard, especially on holidays when I can't talk to them or hear their voices. My son also died in a hospital, so that brings up difficult emotions as well.
I really miss talking to my son and daughter. Hearing their voices used to bring me so much joy. My son was a jokester, and my daughter had an uplifting spirit about her. We shared childhood memories and unique connection, especially talking about my ambivalent mother. I feel like I can't share those memories with others anymore, it just doesn't have the same meaning.
As a patient, I feel confused about my sexual identity as a West Indian young woman. I'm not sure if I'm bisexual or lesbian, and I'm struggling with understanding what it means to be myself in a high school environment that is not always supportive, friendly, or safe.
I felt only some slight unsteadiness after doing the spinning exercise, and I was more nervous before starting the exercise than I am now.
I experienced a slight twinge and felt dizzy right when I stopped after spinning around. On a scale of zero to ten, I would rate the dizziness as a two.
I was riding in the car with a friend, not really thinking about anything. Suddenly, I started to feel that terrible feeling in my chest, like someone was standing on it. It was hard to breathe and I started thinking that I was panicking.
I remember this one time, I was so scared that I thought I might lose my judgment and do something crazy like jump out of the car or grab the steering wheel. My friend would be looking at me like she didn't know who I was. It sounds silly because I know those things don't usually happen, but I couldn't help feeling that way.
I had a panic attack recently, but I managed to write and calm myself a little before getting home. However, I don't think my friend realized that I had a panic attack.
Lately, I've been finding gratitude in small things during the day, like a smile from somebody. However, I feel like it's making me pay more attention to these small things at night.
I started journaling in the morning and then took my son to meet his great-grandmother. We were about to be late, but someone gave us their tickets so we could get in and see her. That night, I journaled about this experience, realizing it was something I was grateful for.
I find that nighttime isn't always the best time for me because I don't have the same spark or energy as I do in the morning. I feel tired at night, but I think being grateful for things that happened during the day is better for me than setting intentions first thing in the morning. I heard you mention the power of writing these things down.
I didn't write down what I was grateful for during the first few days because I thought I could just keep that in my head.
I've been experiencing anxiety due to the difficult transition from being at home, taking care of my son, to moving back into the work world. I've been trying to manage this anxiety by paying attention to nutrition, exercise, and practicing gratitude. Although I feel like I'm managing better now than when I first started, I'm still struggling.
I have been trying to work on gratitude, as we discussed last week. I thought about it for a couple of days and decided that journaling at night might not work for me. So, I decided to do it in the morning instead, with a cup of coffee and setting some intentions for things to be grateful for.
I tried journaling in the morning for a couple of days, but I realized that journaling at night actually works better for me. I found that when I journaled at night, I was more grateful for the smaller things in life. In the morning, I tended to focus more on being grateful for the bigger things like my health, family, and child.
I still feel sometimes anxious, overwhelmed, and busy. However, the hope that we have been discussing feels refreshing to me and makes me feel a bit more optimistic.
I remember when we talked about the gratitude letter, I don't know if I'm ready, and I don't know if I want to send a letter to somebody.
I wasn't quite comfortable with the idea of writing a love letter to someone, but I'm still thinking about it. I said I don't know if I want to do that.
I feel a bit better, but when I sit down to write thank you cards, I struggle with saying what I really want to say, and that pressure is difficult. The idea of not having to send them somewhat alleviates the pressure, but I still worry about articulating my thoughts properly.
I've recently started to write down my thoughts and feelings in a journal, as a way to make them more meaningful to me. I've found that I like putting my thoughts on paper and I am open to discussing my issues with a counselor.
In the beginning, I didn't fully believe in the ideas you mentioned, but I still decided to give them a try. I was talking to someone on the phone the other day about the holidays, which can be difficult for me sometimes. Instead of dreading them, I found myself feeling excited and looking forward to the positive experiences and funny stories that might happen.
I used to believe that I was insane and that I didn't have any choices in difficult situations. However, there was a shift in my thinking, and now I believe that there will be some great things that come up.
As a patient, I am feeling hopeful about the future and what possibilities might be out there for me.
I have been trying different approaches to deal with my situation and issues. I have been exercising, maintaining a routine, and feeling some progress. I also started a gratitude journal, which helps me shift focus and recognize that there are good things happening in my life right now.
I've been realizing that there are some small things that I might not be catching, but when I do, I understand that I actually have a lot of great things happening in my life, beyond the big stuff like family, health, and my son.
I am originally from China and I don't have family here. My husband and I are not living together due to difficulties in our marriage. I work for a family and live at their house, taking care of their children and cooking. My husband spends a lot of money and doesn't pay bills, so I have to cover those expenses.
I do not know why my children are angry with me. For many years, my husband and the two children have been against me. He tells them not to like me or when I'm taking a shower, they turn off the water. I do not know why they do that. My husband tells them these things. When we lived in the mainland, my husband would say we needed to save money, so during winter, he turned off the heat and bought sleeping bags for only him and the children, leaving me without one.
I'm going through a divorce, and it has been really hard for me. When my husband goes away on business, there's nobody to take care of the children, and it stresses me out as I worry about them.
I don't understand why my husband, I don't know what he tells the children. But when I go to the house, they don't open the door and they don't let me inside. They don't talk to me. I, I take food because I worry. Nobody cook for them. Nobody take care of them. I take food and they, they don't open the door.
I feel very sad and unhappy about my situation. I don't know what to do, and sometimes I cry a lot.
I feel isolated because my husband and I don't have any relatives here.
I am a single woman taking care of young children while working full-time. I was doing very well, but seeing the track record of other single mothers struggling to cope makes me scared and concerned. I wish there was a secret to making it easier for people like me, but all I can think of is working part-time and barely making ends meet.
I feel like I have limited options in life, and I'm worried about failing. I know how to take care of myself, but it feels like a really narrow way to live. I just feel so alone and doomed to fail in whatever I do.
I am feeling like I am doomed to fail and won't be able to be there for my children in a positive, cheerful, warm, and loving way, especially since I will be a single parent.
Lately, I've been feeling like I've lost my support system.
I think I'm doing well in many ways, but I have some concerns. I plan to go to work full-time in the fall and have the care of both my sons. I'm worried about coming home tired and having two little boys that need a lot.
I've been struggling with balancing work and personal life, and I haven't really talked about it with anyone in depth. I've only discussed in it a superficial way with my friends. It's a real fear I have, and it's hard for me to face.
I've been trying to find single working mothers with young children who are doing well. I thought I could learn from them, so I've been asking my friends and acquaintances if they know anyone like that. But after a month, I haven't found a single person.
I'm really worried that my life will be constricted as I won't have many things I'm used to and want for myself. It looks like a tough period ahead for me. But, at the same time, I like being able to be sad and complain about how terrible I'm afraid it's going to be. I'm also excited about facing this new phase of my life and seeing what it will be like.
Recently, after I cried and felt sad, I experienced a relief of tension and a shift to something else. I'm not sure how to describe this feeling, but it was like a release after crying. This is what I think about the most in terms of a problem area.
Way I started crying it seemed like I just couldn't wait to get here and cry about it. It was a little dramatic that way. Right, I don't do that very well. I am busy being strong.
I am scared that my main support will be exhausted and irritated. I feel like I may not be able to make it and feel doomed to failure. I have mixed feelings about this, as on one hand, I say to myself that everyone else is going through this, but on the other hand, I appreciate the chance to talk about it.
Recently, I've been feeling pretty down and I don't have much opportunity to be sad with someone about it. It's difficult to go through this alone and without support.
I'm feeling overwhelmed because there seems to be no financial support available for me, and I won't be able to rely on my mother living close by. It feels really sad and lonely.
I often feel depressed, especially when I think about giving up my children. However, I know that this black-and-white thinking isn't realistic, but it feels like my reality. I also feel suspicious of myself because I'm used to getting my needs met, like going out at night and having friends.
I am trying to find a balance between work, social life, and not being overtired. But then I see myself as pampered and think that if I wasn't so pampered, things would be a lot better.
I feel scared about the coming year and feeling so alienated from the Senate. I'm trying to understand and clarify my thoughts and emotions on this.
I love him and care about him, but I am worried about our compatibility since we haven't lived together and he has a very different lifestyle. Can we really form a happy relationship together?
I hadn't thought about it before, but mentioning my children made me realize that my son's presence during the summer is important to me. It makes me happy that we'll have time together when I'm not working.
I am feeling unconsciously busy and depressed. I am scared of what I am taking on and sad about what I am losing for myself. I feel fear and excitement as I will be doing something different in my profession for the first time.
I've been feeling confident as a single woman with young children who are doing well. That's what I want for myself.
I have been financially supporting my son so that he can have more spending money. My oldest son has not agreed to live with me yet, but I am preparing with the hopes that he will. He will be living with me for the rest of the summer.
My relationship with my oldest son has been strained for quite some time. He hasn't been living with me for the past two years, and I want to work on improving our relationship. I'm hoping there will be money for counseling so we can work with a third party to help us.
I don’t seem to be able to control my emotions when someone gets angry, especially my partner. He expresses his anger freely, and I think it's because I grew up in a very angry household, so I don't like anger. I want to get rid of this feeling and not take his anger so personally, but I don't know how.
I just feel so uncomfortable being in that presence that it's something I can't control. It's very overwhelming, and it's all I think about until it's past. I've tried to step back and wait for it to pass, knowing that it's not about me, but it's hard for me.
Sometimes I feel like my past affects my current relationships, especially when my partner gets angry over my reactions to certain situations. I think he believes that I am not responding to him, but instead to my past experiences.
I'm feeling like overall, my partner and I are in pretty good shape. We've been through a lot and managed to get through it. Currently, I think we're just settling in and fine-tuning our relationship.
I think that sometimes when we have disagreements, we experience an emotional or communication block, and I get too focused on my partner's feelings, neglecting my own. I feel like I have to fix every problem, and if they're in a bad mood, it becomes my responsibility to solve it.
Recently, my brother has been pretty moody, and it seems like he gets upset over small things, like getting a spot on his shirt. I'm not sure how to handle this situation.
I think the problem is that my partner, Hugh, takes things very literally, while I tend to be more abstract and vague, often thinking out loud. This has caused a lot of conflict between us.
I've been feeling a bit annoyed lately, and it's been difficult dealing with my partner's anger and irritability. I often feel responsible for solving his problems, but I want to find a way for him to get a better handle on his emotions and for me to feel less responsible.
I often get to a point where I have to scream, and then my mind goes blank, and I can't think. I think it's from my past where I would just shut down. I can't even think straight and say things that make the situation worse. I always feel like I have to fix things, even with my partner's family problems.
I guess I could learn better to deal with my anger, because everybody gets angry sometimes, and it's unrealistic to say don't get angry. I feel like I can't cope with things in an abstract way, I usually do organizing and ordering, and sometimes I think out loud about what I am going to do.
I understand that if we commit ourselves to this course of action, we may be dealing with events that are frequent enough that we don't have to plan. It might happen anyway, and we can be confident about that. Our goal is not to change them but to bring in the details to talk about, and that's where the change occurs. I feel that's a good plan, and I think we have come through some stuff.
I feel comfortable with the plan we discussed. However, I find it interesting that when we started, we had disagreements and my partner thought we shouldn't see a counselor. But after attending the sessions, he felt that we were doing better than most people. Since then, we've had some disagreements, and he didn't want to talk about them but bring them here.
I've had counseling before and I've been uncomfortable with doing homework tasks. My partner tends to remind me and can be a bit nagging about it. We want him to understand the impact he has on me, but it's difficult because he can be inconsolable and inflexible.
I often think out loud and in an abstract manner, which sometimes irritates my partner because he prefers concrete thinking. I would like to find a way to accept each other's thinking styles, and for him to understand that sometimes I need to think in this way.
I've been having trouble thinking abstractly and I'm waiting for something concrete to happen. I think it might happen in the next couple of days.
I have been experiencing some tension in my shoulder, and I'm not sure how to communicate with it to help it relax. It doesn't speak words, but is there a way for it to show that it's okay with something?
I find it difficult to say something positive about myself. My shoulder feels more confident than the rest of my body that nothing bad will happen if I say something positive. My parts trust me to a certain extent, about a four out of ten.
I've been struggling with certain issues for about four years, but it's only within the last year that I've noticed a shift in my feelings. However, I'm still feeling quite tentative about these changes.
I've been having trouble with addiction, but I managed to stay sober today and wanted to share this small victory. I hope that the parts inside me can recognize this achievement. I want them to see that I'm working on it and determined to get better.
As the patient, I feel like I cannot express positive feelings. During the session, the counsellor tried to help me say something positive to my fight part, to the shoulder twitch part, but that only triggered me and made me dissociate. The counsellor did not pick up on it immediately, and I felt like they were just trying to end the session.
I was in a therapy session, and after we ended, my therapist noticed I was really triggered. They helped me use some sensory motor psychotherapy coping techniques I've learned, like feeling my feet on the ground and linking to my spine. As I looked around the room, I gradually came back into the present. However, I think my therapist forgot something I told them earlier, and they unintentionally brought up a challenging topic.
As the patient, I noticed that my shoulder is like a visual barometer, it shows what's going on with me emotionally and physically. I can't miss it and it's both true and amazing.
Lately, I've been experiencing some concerns with my shoulder. I'm not quite sure what it's worried about.
I've been practicing some techniques for dealing with my issues, and I think my shoulder is worried about me having more dialogue with the parts. However, I still feel like there is not enough evidence that I can handle things well enough.
Lately, I have been working on growing trust within myself and becoming safe and stable. It has been a challenging process, not a picnic. There's also this shoulder issue I am dealing with.
I feel grateful to my shoulder most times, as it keeps me alert and reminds me to be gentle and slow. However, sometimes I find it difficult to indicate that something is meaningful to me.
As the patient, I joined the session feeling a bit hesitant and unsure. I was asked by the counsellor if I can speak about my feelings and if nodding is okay. I tried to respond but I felt a bit stuck, so the counsellor suggested I ask my shoulder to help express myself. Unfortunately, my shoulder said no.
I can't fully acknowledge my emotions, especially positive feelings, because it feels like there are internal 'firefighters' and 'managers' stopping me. When it comes to anger, I start to twitch and feel overwhelmed, but I try to jump away from it quickly.
I'm frustrated because I want to talk about and work through my issues, but my shoulder seems to hold me back. I have tried asking my shoulder what it's worried about and have received some informative information that has led to powerful shifts in my emotions.
I feel like I've been able to separate the big issues in my life, like my sobriety and dealing with past traumas. However, I'm struggling with the smaller issues, like acknowledging positive feelings. I can experience them, but I have a hard time vocalizing them. This is making it difficult for me to be in relationships with people.
I experience intense dissociation when I try to verbalize certain things; my body seems to reject talking about it, and it's difficult for me to connect meaningfully with people because of this.
I like spending time with people, but due to my past traumas, I often can't let them know that I enjoy those moments. My body allows me to experience the positives, but I feel the need to remain silent about my emotions. Additionally, I struggle with processing certain emotions, such as anger, as I have a hard time even feeling it.
I feel like my shoulder is worried and thinks that the emotion of anger is very dangerous. It seems to be related to defending or stopping something.
I'm feeling worried about what will happen as a result of my anger. I have a very vocal and articulate voice in my head that tries to make sense of it all. But when I was a child, it was dangerous for me to feel these strong emotions.
Lately, I've been feeling like my old coping mechanism involving my shoulder isn't useful anymore. I'm not sure if I should continue with it or move on to something else.
I'm having trouble understanding my anger and my shoulder seems to be reacting negatively to it. I'm not really sure what it's worried about, could you help me?
I feel hesitant to talk about my anger because I worry that discussing it will make me feel it even more. My shoulder seems to agree with this feeling, but I'm not sure what bad thing would happen if I start to feel the anger.
I have this forceful tension in my jaw that goes down into my shoulder blade, arm, and even in my fist. When I feel the twitch, I also feel tension in my neck muscles.
I've recently realized that when I say it's okay to feel certain emotions like anxiety or excitement, my body and its parts seem to listen to me.
I have parts and a body that trusts me enough to consider believing me, but this wasn't always the case. It's taken a lot of work to reach this point in my life.
As the patient, I feel good that my parts trust me, but my shoulder is not comfortable with it.
I'm feeling a dichotomy between my thoughts and my shoulder's reactions. My mind is okay with acknowledging positive feelings, but my shoulder seems to disagree and never allows me to say something is good.
I have been struggling with the fact that I'm unable to remember or integrate positive experiences and growth in my life after trauma. This has baffled me and other therapists for many years. I have made progress in my life since the last traumatic event, but the information doesn't seem to have reached the different parts of my mind and body.
In the past 20 years, I've grown in various ways and developed a stable life, but I still feel like my traumatic experiences haven't been integrated by the more positive parts of me. I often struggle with survival instincts being evoked by my environment.
Since I started working on myself, I've been trying to go slow and reassure myself throughout the day. Recently, someone got angry with me, but I noticed that I was able to protect myself from their unnecessary attack.
I recently set a boundary with someone who got angry at me. A week before, she got mad at me for something, and this time I decided to let her know that it's not my responsibility. I did it without being confrontational or adversarial.
I've been struggling with what I call the 'trickle down effect.' Even though my life is stable now and I am a respected adult with a steady job, I feel like others don't recognize the changes that have taken place in my life. One of my clients said they don't need to tell people about these changes, as they should be able to see it for themselves.
I used to struggle with feeling sadness or excitement, but now I can easily feel sad and be excited about things. It hasn't always been easy for me to access these emotions.
I have been working with my therapist on understanding my feelings and which ones were permissible for me as a child. Recently, I was able to differentiate between fear and excitement and recognize that they have similar physiological reactions. This has helped me stay present during moments of excitement and not misinterpret them as fear.
As a patient, I am having a hard time expressing myself and have trouble speaking to my counsellor. During the session, there are many moments of silence when I am unable to respond. I feel like my shoulder is causing me some issues and wants to be stable and safe.
Lately, I've been struggling with some issues and have done a lot of work to address them. I'm not sure if there are any other questions I should ask before we finish our session.
I have had limited knowledge about bisexuality. I have always tended to view things as either lesbian, gay, or straight without really thinking about the fact that there are people who are bisexual and do not fit into any one of these categories.
I want to understand bisexuality better so I don't project my beliefs on a student who may identify as bisexual. The student has come to me with these feelings and I think it's wonderful that they trust me enough to talk about it.
I feel very good that a student has come to me and told me about their bisexuality, and I think it's a wonderful aspect of their identity. But, I haven't given much thought to my own emotions and feelings about someone saying they are bisexual.
I think the resource list would be a very excellent start for me, and it's something that I can also pass on to others. I will definitely keep the option open to come back and find out more from you in the future.
I just wanted to say that I appreciated talking with you and it has been helpful for me.
I feel like I've failed in some way, but I know I'm not the only one responsible. I didn't have control over the situation, yet deep down, there's a feeling that tells me something else could have been done. But it's more of a bodily feeling, not something I think about consciously.
I feel a sense of loss and sadness, even though I believe the experience has made me stronger in some ways. There was a difficult episode in my relationship with my husband, and although we didn't discuss our feelings about the loss, I saw a side of him I'd never seen before, which showed me his strength.
I feel that despite the grief and loss we experienced, there were some good things that emerged from it, like love and strength. But I still have this deep wish to complete it by being able to give my partner a child.
I'm scared that my whole life has been a mistake because I couldn't have a child, and there's pressure from my family, especially my terminally ill mother who always wanted a grandchild. I feel like I've lost because I believe in winning and losing, and in this situation, I lost.
I feel like I've lost an important game as I failed to have children. Having a child is important not only for me but also for my husband, parents, and others who would want a grandchild. I believe it's normal and proper to have a child, and I'm struggling with the fact that I lost twins. I can't imagine what I could do to replace them or have a child.
Lately, I've been feeling extremely overwhelmed with work, and it has become difficult for me to manage my time efficiently. I've started to fall behind and it's causing me to panic. Do you have any suggestions on how I can better handle this situation?
I lost a set of twins about two-and-a-half years ago, which was my first pregnancy. I didn't enjoy it at all, as I considered pregnancy to be unattractive. I'm now afraid that if I'm pregnant again, there could be another loss.
I have been struggling with trying to get pregnant and it's been causing me a lot of emotional stress. I wonder if I should have tried getting pregnant earlier, instead of focusing on my career. I don't really discuss it with anyone and I question myself a lot.
I've been through a loss and I feel like I could've done something differently to prevent it. Logically, I know I was doing the best I could, but I feel like I failed because I was the keeper and things didn't go well. I've always had everything I wanted and this makes me feel like a failure. I still want to have a child, but I'm also worried about the biological time clock.
I'm usually able to work on things and put them into perspective, but there's something happening that I feel I don't have control over. I'm the kind of person who's used to controlling things and getting my way, and it's worked for me in most aspects, except for this one.
I feel like there's a big void in my life because I don't have a child. I have a loving and wonderful husband, and our marriage is great, but I feel cheated that we can't share the experience of having a child together. I'm also hesitant to tell people, even my husband, if I do become pregnant.
I have something highly personal and it's easier to talk about to strangers than to people who mean a lot to me. I worry that they could get hurt again like last time. I suppose I should just see what happens. If something good comes, fantastic, if something bad comes, then it's just me who's hurt.
I feel like if I had control over my life, everything would be perfect. I think I've dealt with the loss of my child fairly well, but sometimes, especially during the holidays, visiting the grave and thinking about what could have been still brings up a lot of sadness and grief for me.
I have been struggling with a feeling that comes and goes, and I feel like I've failed in some way because I can't control it completely. Talking to you has made it easier for me, but I still can't help but feel like a failure.
I feel like there's something wrong with my body since I can't conceive a child even though the doctor says I'm healthy. I do everything the doctor says, eat the right foods, and stay in decent shape. But despite all that, I lost a child and I feel like it's out of my control. The doctor says it's just a matter of time, but it's making me feel like a failure.
I want to succeed in life and am willing to make sacrifices for important things like having a child. I feel like I can't win in that aspect of life. I would do whatever it takes to be a good parent, but it's difficult not having control over the situation.
I find that cultural aspects and my personal history keep coming up in my interactions, and I believe it's crucial to acknowledge and appreciate these factors to really help a person like me.
I feel like I need to change my approach in dealing with my situation. I think I should try to look at it from a different perspective, not push so hard, and stay on the phone to ensure help is there when needed.
I am feeling worried about a situation involving my sister. I think I need to talk to her to figure out what she's really saying and have a more open discussion about it. I believe that as an older brother, it's my responsibility to address this matter.
Lately, I've been struggling with coming up with some beginning ideas for my project.
I have been feeling overwhelmed with the responsibility of taking care of my dad. It has been affecting my decision-making process, and I think I might be starting to feel angry about being saddled with this responsibility.
I come from an Anglo-Celtic background, and my dad is Celtic-Cornish. I was raised in a family that encouraged me to be independent and move away from home. Our family boundaries have been pretty tight, but I get confused about when I should step in and take more responsibility for my dad as he gets older.
I've been trying to help my dad, but I'm not sure if he wants my assistance. Whenever I think about this situation, I feel a lot of anxiety in my stomach. I might be pushing him a little too hard, and maybe he wants to hang on tough as long as he can. I don't know if I should lay back more.
I was wondering if you could tell me more about my family of origin. I am concerned about my dad and his wife, but I'm not sure if there's anyone else involved who needs to be concerned about this situation.
I'm really puzzled about what to do, as I'm here in Massachusetts and my dad is far away. He has done a lot for me, and I want to do more for him, but I feel guilty for not being able to. He is blind, 85 years old, and his second wife is supportive, but they're both frail. I want to be closer to them, but I still have my job and kids to take care of.
Lately, I've been facing a lot going on in my life and I find myself not sleeping well at night. I haven't really made any plans or thought about possible alternatives or options to deal with the situation.
I feel like my wife and I might be pushing too hard on closing down my mother-in-law's house. I start getting down on myself and thinking about our daughter, Mary. I realized that I'm not as alone in this as I thought, as my kids are supportive and want to help, but it's still hard to imagine grandpa getting older.
Sometimes I feel that I'm making more of my issues with my family than necessary. They are supportive, and I do get to see them and call them sometimes. I'm the oldest in my family, and maybe that has something to do with how I feel.
I always assume more responsibility than I probably need to, and I constantly want to make sure things are going well and fix things. However, sometimes I have to remind myself to slow down and take into account that there are other people involved.
Lately, I've been really concerned about a particular person in my life and I'm not sure how to handle the situation.
I feel like my sister is struggling with her job right now, and even though my kids are grown up, I still feel like their responsibility lies on my shoulders. My sister is supportive, but I'm not sure if she agrees with me.
I feel like I might be taking on too much responsibility lately. I haven't really talked about it before, but it's like I'm going on as the Lone Ranger, doing everything by myself.
I am grateful for my wife's support, as she listens to me a lot. Her mother is moving on in years as well, so we have some common ground there.
I am an individualistic and determined person who likes to be self-contained. I really don't want to be dependent on anyone or anything.
I have been trying to support a family member, and while they seem to appreciate my help, it feels like they get overwhelmed if I start doing too much.
Well, having looked at some of those elements, I don't know if any of this has helped you to sort out any of your thoughts on these.
I feel my shoulders not as tense anymore and I feel a bit more centered regarding my issue. But it's a pattern for me to overthink and worry a problem to death.
I've given a lot of thought to multicultural issues and counseling. I have a Celtic-Cornish background, which is very similar to the Irish. We tend to be stubborn, independent, hold back emotions, not talk a lot, and maybe be a little secretive.
I have grown up in a culture that emphasizes independence, which can be seen through the saying 'One and all.' It highlights how we are individuals but also together as a community. I was always expected to be an individual and excel on my own.
As I've gotten into multicultural issues, I feel like there's too much emphasis on it and I miss my Dad. I want to be closer to him, just like my family upbringing suggests.
Recently, I've been feeling quite bothered by a friend who seems to be really gutty. It's really been affecting me and I'm not sure how to handle the situation.
I care about my son's father, even though I don't want to be with him. My son being without a father worries me. People say I don't love myself, but I love my son and will do anything for him. I am trying to get out of the situation.
My partner is a black belt in karate and he hits me so much in the head that sometimes I don't know if I'm going to wake up. It's really scary and I can't protect myself from him.
I don't know, maybe, I know I should leave him and I know everybody is saying to leave him, but nobody's in my shoes to say, 'Just get up and go.' It's impossible just to get up and go. I don't like my son to see what goes on. I just have to deal with it until I can make my own money.
I feel like I have a problem and that I'm in a lot of danger. Although there are times when everything seems great with my partner, and we can be excellent for two or three weeks.
I just wish that things would be a lot different, and I hate my son seeing me get hit. That's the thing that hurts about me, not me getting hit. Him seeing it. I don't care about myself.
I really don't care if anything happens to me. Until I met him, I just... He used to stalk me. I'd go to like paper chef parties or something and he would be out the window looking at me and he goes, 'I seen you talking to some guy.' And I was like, 'it was the person that was having a chef, paper chef party's husband.'
I used to take care of myself everyday, but then I started getting put down repeatedly until I began to give up on myself. This all started happening when we began dating and considered having a baby.
I used to do my walk around, exercise, put make-up on, curl my hair and take care of myself everyday. I always go out and buy myself something special once in a while, but now it's like...
I know I need help and my boss is supportive of me going to counseling. She's even suggested that Victor and I could move out into her upstairs apartment, but I'm worried about the money.
I was talking to a friend about my financial problems and being late on payments. She told me that there will be people who can help me out and that I don't know how many people really care about me. But they don't want to help me now because I am with my current partner. She even offered me to move in with her, but she's scared that my partner will show up there, which is putting a strain on her as well.
I don't want to keep Victor away from his father, but I am afraid for my safety and my son's safety.
I don't love him and he doesn't love me either, but we don't want our son Victor to be without his father. I am a great mom and I never did anything wrong for them to take my child away from me. But the situation is really complicated.
It's not good. I know it's not good. It's awful. I mean, I don't want this for my son. And if I really love my son as much as I say, I should just leave. But, I mean, everybody tells me. It's not as easy as people think it is. It's not as easy. I can't do it on my own. It's just, it's hard. I do. I mean, it's just, it's just a lot of saving up and, you know, just doing it, you know, saving up before I move out.
Lately, I've been feeling so unsafe and threatened in my current situation. I don't know what to do or how to get out of it.
I feel a strong longing to be with my partner and have a normal family, but he's not being a full partner or helping. When he's calm, I get drawn back in and feel like we can have a healthy relationship. I used to be more independent and would dump guys for trivial reasons.
You know, I used to dump guys for anything, even if they were really good, and now I regret it. Now I'm with Miguel and feel stuck. I want to move out of the house, but I want him to know where we are so he can see our son.
I want my partner to be with me, but I wish things could be okay for both of us. Is there any hope for my partner to get better if he gets counseling?
I notice that once I get hit, it always escalates and becomes worse over time. But, I think I have been ignoring this information.
I'm looking for another night job to cover my expenses, but daycare is too expensive, and I'm already paying half of the rent. I don't think I can make it on my own with the additional costs for food and stuff.
I keep going back to my husband even though he's abusive because he apologizes and sometimes blames me for making him upset. He had a rough life too, so I understand why he might act the way he does.
I express to my partner that I would prefer if he leaves the room during an argument for an hour, so we both can calm down. However, he has a different perspective and thinks it's being a wimp or girly to help me with household chores or taking care of our son while I'm upset. I feel like I'm the one always complaining, even though I see this issue being discussed on talk shows too.
Well I never knew my father, but I knew that my mother had lost all her self-esteem. That's why she put herself in the predicament of having eight children with a man who never treated her well. I feel like I never had a father figure, so I latched onto someone quickly. My mother tells me to leave him, but it's hard because she never did, and nobody understands.
I don't want to move back to my mother's house because my sister and her kids are living there, and I can't stand their lifestyle. I have an option to live upstairs from my boss's work, but I'm worried about not making enough money to cover all my expenses.
I was discussing my relationship problems with a friend who told me she would do anything for me but not for my husband. It made me mad but also made sense, as she went through a divorce herself. My husband questions why I listen to people who have gone through divorces and can't find any normal families to listen to. He even questions my loyalty, but I assure him I've never cheated on him. The issue is my inability to leave this marriage and I feel like there's nowhere to go.
I am afraid to leave my partner because I think he should be part of my son's life. My son loves him dearly, and my partner loves him too. We do have our problems, but I don't think it's right to just leave him without knowing where my son and I are. It's scary because I feel like leaving him, and then the next day, things are fine and normal again.
I feel like I pay a huge price for that little bit of normal time in my life.
I am worried about being alone and not being able to pay the bills if I leave Miguel, though my boss has assured me that I will have help and support.
I am worried because I feel like people will say they will support me, but then they might turn their back on me when I need it. I know my friend wouldn't do that, but it's still scary.
I'm really worried about my financial situation and not having enough money for food. I don't want to depend on anyone, but I'm feeling overwhelmed.
I have tried to remove myself from situations when my partner gets angry, but he blocks the door and won't let me leave.
When I try to go to another room to get some space, my partner follows me and continues arguing. He also doesn't share his financial information even though I ask for help with the bills. I feel overwhelmed and frustrated with this situation.
I am struggling with financial issues in my relationship. My partner controls all the money, and I feel like it should be shared more equally. I keep giving him money, but remain frustrated when he doesn't spend on necessary things like diapers. My boss even refuses to give me an advance on my salary, knowing it will go to my partner.
I'm struggling with my living arrangements and finances due to my current situation as a mother. I haven't explored any support networks or alternative options available in my community yet.
We got in a fight because he left the house. He came back and tried to take our son away. He has hit me before and now my son hits me too. I don't want my child to witness and experience the same trauma that I went through when I was younger.
I'm feeling really upset because my partner didn't take my feelings into consideration and became physically abusive again. I told him the truth about my feelings, but now I'm questioning if I should have lied to prevent getting hurt.
I feel scared because I know I should leave my partner, but it's not easy for me to just get up and go. Nobody understands my situation, and I don't want my son to witness what's happening at home. I feel like I have to endure this until I can make my own money.
I feel scared when I hear my partner's reaction because it's so painful for me. Although there are times when we are great together and everything seems fine for weeks, suddenly things change drastically.
I remember that time he hit me when I was pregnant, and he even cried after that. But sometimes, it can be great between us. I just can't stand the high price I'm paying for those moments.
I don't know. It's easier to say like, 'I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving.' But it's so hard to do it. The hardest thing right now is that I know I'm doing wrong by staying.
As a patient, I attended a therapy session which involved both brief therapy and crisis intervention. For the first 15 minutes, the counsellor was formulating their approach, and then they became more active and involved in providing important feedback to me.
I'm very concerned about my son. My husband is hitting me so much in the head that sometimes I don't know if I'm going to wake up. I want to get out of there for the sake of my son, but I worry about what will happen if he's left only with my husband.
I'm tired of arguing with my husband as he doesn't help me out and expects me to do everything around the house while he watches TV after work. Our battles have been going on for a while, so I've started going to my mom's when I know we'll fight. I don't want to leave him because he's a good father to our child.
I'm having trouble saving money because my boss wants me to just give it to her to hold onto. She suggests that I could save enough to move out on my own and live upstairs in her apartment. But it's hard for me to save up as the bills keep coming. I haven't explored other options like sharing a house with single mothers.
I want to calm myself down using the rapid relaxation skill. Then a thought enters my mind that I won't know what to say after I say hello. Immediately I say stop in my mind and picture a big red stop sign. Then I refocus my attention and take my mind off the negative thought and think about what I would like to do in this situation. I think about Jack who is standing over there and how can I ask him about his son's basketball game last night.
I have become aware of my negative self-talk that contributes to my anxiety in social situations. I often say things like, 'I'm not going to be able to do this,' 'I'm going to get too nervous,' 'Everybody's going to notice,' and 'They're going to think something's wrong with me.' When I see the situation that way, it looks very scary, and I don't feel confident at all. I feel like I'm not going to be able to handle it, and everyone will notice.
I feel bad, nervous, and scared when having negative self-talk. I understand my predictions usually overestimate the bad things and underestimate my ability to manage, but I can't stop myself from thinking this way.
I have been practicing muscle relaxation techniques to calm myself, but I still experience a lot of anxiety. When I'm relaxed and thinking about something calm, it feels nice. However, when I start to think about a negative situation, like people laughing at me, I quickly lose that feeling of relaxation.
I recently learned about a technique called thought-stopping to help control my anxiety, but I'm still not entirely sure how it works. Can you explain it more?
I have a sales summary presentation that takes about 5 minutes. I present the sales statistics for the last quarter and I've practiced it at home.
Well, I tell you, I'm usually a wreck when meeting someone new, like the husband of a colleague at a business dinner. I don't know what to say and the more nervous I get, the harder it is to make conversation.
I was practicing basic conversation with my counsellor and we decided to do some role-play to make me more comfortable with it. We reviewed some guidelines from my reading assignment, like taking the initiative to break the ice, having a follow-up question in mind, maintaining a friendly facial expression, making eye contact, and watching my body language. I just wanted to clarify about maintaining eye contact, how long should I do it without making others uncomfortable?
I remember generating alternative predictions. We said that I might get nervous but if I stay focused on what I want to do, I can probably do it. It's just hard to believe when I'm in this situation.
Well laying them out, rehearsing them, that helps. Staying focused, not getting distracted by my heart rate. But I haven't been too anxious either. Of course, I've been doing situations that are only twos and threes.
I have a presentation to the board in a few weeks, and I rated my anxiety level for it as a five. I think I need to try some coping strategies that I've been using for lower anxiety levels.
I have been struggling with articulating my thoughts and issues during our sessions, and it makes me feel very anxious. I'm unsure how to effectively communicate what I want to say.
I feel overwhelmed with all the strategies I've read about. I want to be able to practice them more effectively.
The last time I really remember doing that was when I was painting. I'm not really an artist, at all. But sometimes just the act of painting and being able to create something, I can lose myself in that. Just the process of it. Last summer, I had a very emotional class and I really just didn't want to think about things anymore. So on my way home, I just stopped and picked up some paints. I actually ended up finger painting that night. All evening, I spent just playing in paint.
Lately, I've been feeling down and overwhelmed. I recently tried painting as a way to cope with my emotions. I found it convenient because I can just stay at home and relax. I think adding a positive activity like this to my routine would be helpful. But I'm really busy and sometimes I struggle with setting boundaries. Can you suggest any other activities or strategies for managing my emotions?
I've been experiencing anxiety which gets in the way of my life. Recently, I've started making some changes like watching my schedule, not overbooking myself, and trying to say no to people. This is quite difficult for me, but I'm noticing some improvements in my anxiety levels.
I've been practicing setting boundaries and not saying yes to everything. This helps me manage my day better. I also avoid scheduling things one after the other, so I have time to take a break and enjoy things more without feeling rushed.
In our last session, we talked about incorporating more activities that I enjoy into my life while dealing with my issues. I wanted to bring it up again because I am still finding it challenging to find a balance.
I don't know what I could do while I'm painting because it is very hands-on. But, I know that there are specific days that are particularly stressful that I would like to work about anything at the end of those days.
I have to focus on what's in front of me because my past has held me back. I want new and improved things, but I know I have to deal with my past. I can't do everything at once, and I'll be okay with that.
I've been reading books on how to document my feelings and emotions, and I've started putting them on paper so that I can read them and keep them in front of me instead of behind me. My studies in the psychological field have helped me to heal and become more courageous by looking at myself from the inside out.
Lately, I've been feeling like I need control over everything in my life. I realize it's important, but perhaps it doesn't have to be so rigid. Maybe I can find a way to control the situation without running away from it.
I try to spend as much time with people as possible, but if I feel discomfort that I can't bear, I walk away. The discomfort I feel is nausea and I don't know how to overcome it.
I have been trying meditation and different styles of breathing to calm myself down, but I still find that I need to physically walk away from the situation to truly feel better.
I am willing to try using yoga to help deal with my issues. I think it could be beneficial in certain situations, like if I were to run into that woman again.
I have been experiencing PTSD symptoms, and I feel a lot of anxiety. I am trying to find an ideal way to contain the physiological symptoms that occur to me.
Well, I'm dealing with residual memories and flashbacks. I've been trying to take control and understand these memories by journaling and reading over them. I know no one can hurt me again as I'm older and stronger now. I've also started doing yoga to focus more on my well-being.
As a patient, I recently experienced a triggering event that left me unable to drive, but since then I have been talking more openly with my parents about my problems, and school seems to be going fine.
I have a good GPA and I've been working long, hard hours. I'm happy with how school is going, but I've noticed that I've been using school as a crutch. I keep telling myself that if I focus on school, everything else will just line up and I can deal with my emotions later.
I recently had a really bad experience with someone which triggered a flood of memories from my younger life. The situation was so overwhelming that I couldn't deal with the images, and I was just crying inconsolably.
I had a panic attack on campus a couple of days ago when I saw someone who gave me a very bad, eerie feeling, and it started to bring up negative feelings. I ran into the locker room and started hyperventilating, eventually needing my dad to come get me because I couldn't drive.
I just had a lot of images going through my head. I had, uhm, just a lot of memories coming and flooding into me where I could not see straight and I was doubled over my steering wheel and just saying to myself, 'It'll go away. It'll go away. It'll go away.' It was just a flood of, of images, just different, different images of different periods of time in my life and I just got flooded.
I have this inability to trust people because I don't want to get hurt. I put up thick walls and make sure people understand my boundaries and not to cross them. I feel that everyone has the potential to hurt me.
I know, deep down, that my fear isn't true, but I can't control the thought that someone might hurt me. It's like an immediate reaction I can't control.
I have a continuous emotion that affects how I meet people. I try to be open and receptive, but I always want to be in control of the situation and how far it goes, whether it's developing friendships or professional relationships.
I've been struggling with trust issues because of past experiences where no one would help me. As a result, I've developed a need to stay in control to protect myself.
I don't think avoiding the situation is doing me any good, it's creating more tension inside of me. I want to face it by going to that location and making my presence known, being more assertive and owning the situation. I am not sure what to do if I run into that woman again.
I am afraid of running into a certain woman because of past emotions flooding in, and I try to remind myself that she's not the people who hurt me in the past. However, I'm not sure if that's enough.
I've been feeling overwhelmed lately, and I'm struggling with trust issues. I want to find ways to master my feelings and work on these issues, but I'm not sure where to start.
I feel like I'm the one who's always compromising in my relationship. I consider myself to be flexible, but my partner isn't. It's weird, I don't feel this way when I'm not out in the world, but when I'm here with you in this setting, I don't know.
I've been talking about what I want in life and I realize that I really love and care for the people around me, but sometimes my loyalty towards them is impractical.
I came to school to get a job to help my family, but now it's not a necessity anymore. I like school, it's fun and I enjoy spending time with my classmates. However, my husband wants me to stay home and take care of the house since he works. I've been feeling sad lately because I miss school, but I don't think my husband would be happy if I continue.
I am in a group where I feel happy, but I also have personal desires that I want to fulfill. However, sometimes I hide those desires because I don't know if they align with the group's needs or wants. This struggle between my happiness and my desires has become a pressing issue for me.
This is my first time here and I didn't really want to come. I've never been to see a counselor or therapist before. My friend Lauren said I should come because I haven't been going to class for the last three or four weeks, and she was worried about me. I originally went back to school to get a degree and help with finances at home, but my husband's job situation has improved.
I never really had to make a decision because it just sort of happened. I don't always know what's expected of me. It wasn't a life-altering decision like going to college, high school, getting married, or being in a relationship. That's what's supposed to happen.
I did what I wanted to do, but then everyone's just left and there's no support. I don't want to be alone, and I think if this ruins our relationship, everyone's going to blame me.
I feel like when we talk about safety, it sounds like you're implying my partner is abusive. But he's never hit me before, and I don't think he's abusive. I just worry that if I lose the protection and care he provides, I won't have anything.
I recently worked with five different therapists and the psychoanalytic perspective really resonated with me. During the session, the therapist drew so many connections and everything made sense. I felt really enlightened and found a good groove as we proceeded.
I'm struggling with a big conflict in my life. I want to continue my education but my partner is the main breadwinner and I feel like it's not my choice to make. I also feel like it's unfair to my partner because my desires have changed since the beginning of our relationship.
I'm feeling really frustrated because my partner changed his mind about a major decision that affects both of us. I don't want to make him unhappy, but I'm worried about my own happiness and dealing with difficult consequences.
I came to see the counsellor because my friend was annoying me by constantly calling and coming to my house. I'm not sure if I need this session, but I do hope to get over whatever is bothering me eventually. I like school and my friend sees how much I enjoy it, but she doesn't understand why I don't finish it because of our cultural differences.
I feel like I can't be as independent as my friend Lauren because I have responsibilities towards my family. My husband doesn't understand my feelings and gets annoyed when I try to share them. He doesn't like me going to school and doesn't like my friend Lauren because they both have strong opinions.
I feel like I have to do things because it's what's good for the family, even if I don't want to. It makes me feel sad.
In the past, I've just gone along with what everyone else wanted for my life, like finishing school, getting married, and having kids. I never really had to make big decisions; they just sort of happened. Now I find myself pulled in different directions by my family and husband, and I'm not sure what to do.
I recently moved from the East Coast to the Pacific Northwest due to my husband's job. It's been really hard for me because I don't have any friends here and I've lost touch with most of my friends back home. The way people communicate here is also different. My husband has family here, but it's still tough for me.
I didn't really want to come in actually. My friend Lauren made me come. She's one of my classmates and she was worried about me because she hasn't seen me in class the last three or four weeks.
I'm considering dropping out of school because I'm not doing well and I think I don't need it. My partner thinks it's a good idea for me to stay home, and maybe we can have kids soon. I wasn't an A-student anyway, so I feel like this decision makes sense for our family.
I'm not a quick thinker, and when we argue, my partner is very verbal and makes so much sense that I can't defend my argument. I end up giving up and it's frustrating. I want to stay in school, but I don't know how to make it happen.
My life's been a mix of emotions lately, and although I feel sad, I know I'll get over it. However, I haven't really had many opportunities in my life to sit down and think about what I want or how I'm feeling. Talking about it feels strange, but it's also nice and makes me feel better.
I've noticed that I have no issues when I'm with my husband, but when I'm alone, it gets harder for me. My friend persuaded me to come here, and I do feel better after talking to you.
I felt like my previous therapist, Katherine, had a direction she wanted to take me, which felt limiting, but the relationship was more egalitarian compared to my work with Doctor Hunt. We had a really good rapport, and I trusted her. I felt like we were equal partners in the process.
I felt kind of confused with the whole experience with Steven Scheutz because the questions he asked didn't make much sense. It felt like it was all about me, and not my family or husband, which made it seem kind of silly. I can't just focus on me; there are other people near me. But, I appreciated when he said that this space is for me to express my emotions, and I liked that he set that tone.
I've been struggling with my partner, who often dominates decision-making in our relationship. I have a hard time pushing back or asserting my needs. I just go with the flow because it's easier, but I'm not sure if my partner even wants to understand me more.
I always went with the flow, as my parents expected me to help out at home, look after my brother, go to school, get a job, get married, and have kids. It's just the natural order of things, isn't it? That's what everyone does.
I feel lucky that I don't have to work or go to school. I can just stay home and take care of the house. Many women aren't able to do that and have to deal with papers and bosses. I think that's pretty lucky.
I was in school for a year and then went for fall and winter quarters. I managed to score B's-ish, but it was hard with lots of writing and reading. I can't manage my home and studies at the same time, and I have been trying to finish my degree as soon as possible so I can get a job and help with finances.
I'm feeling pressured to start a family now, but I'd prefer to wait for another five years if it was up to me. My husband and parents also want me to have children, but I'm aware of the increasing risk of birth defects as I age, and I'm currently 31. Additionally, finances and the economy have made it challenging for us to consider having kids so far.
My family keeps asking me when I am going to start a family and have children. They constantly remind me that I am not getting any younger, which makes me feel pressured and stressed.
I'm the type of person that can go with the flow, you know, and make the best of both situations, any situation. But my partner doesn't like that I'm not at home when he calls, and sometimes I'm out with classmates after class. He gets frustrated with that, and I feel guilty because he's the one paying for my education. I'm not sure whether I should continue school or just focus on having a family.
I guess it really wouldn't be different. That's why I might not wanna go to school then. You know, I don't need a school to be a mom. I don't need a degree to be a mom, I need to be a wife.
I've been feeling less joyful since I've been out of school. When I'm not in school, I find joy in spending time with my husband and finding good shopping deals. I'm wondering if it's possible to balance school, family, and other aspects of life.
I don't think I'm like those people who are smart enough to do both things. I've never gotten really good grades in school and have to work really hard to get even B's. I've met people who can effortlessly get good grades, but I struggle a lot and still don't achieve A's, which I believe are necessary to be a good student.
Well, I guess I feel inferior because my parents and my mostly Asian friends have good grades, and they're the type to get degrees and be professionals. I just don't think I'm that type.
I don't know, it's just hard not getting what I want sometimes but I understand that I can't always have what I want, especially if it's at the expense of other people. My husband doesn't want me to go to school. If we don't have kids now and we have them later and there's something wrong with the child, it would be my fault. If I'm not home and they get into trouble, it would also be my fault.
I hate getting into arguments with my partner because I'm not a fast thinker, and it always feels like he's right. It's difficult for me to express my feelings and thoughts during those arguments, and I'm not sure how he'd react if I talked to him when things are calm.
After the session, I had time to think about it and process it, I felt like I couldn't really understand the connection. The therapist seemed so knowledgeable, and the connection made sense, but when I processed it, I couldn't fully grasp it.
I liked the therapist, and after the session, I had some time to process everything that we discussed.
I really felt like we had a more equal relationship compared to my previous experience with Doctor Hunt. She focused a lot on my thoughts and feelings.
I believe it's important to be there for my children and support my husband, who works hard to provide for our family. I don't want to put my kids in daycare. In our culture, we could ask my mom to stay with us but we live too far away from the East Coast where my family resides.
My parents both worked when I was young, with my mom being a nanny and my dad working in a restaurant. My mom would take care of other children, so she was rarely home. I took care of my younger brother and had to assume an adult role early on.
I feel kind of stuck because my mom had to work when we were young, and I know my parents would have preferred her to stay home with us. I think this feeling won't last long and I will eventually get over it and move on.
I don't know, it's, well, to be honest, it's mostly always what he wants, you know? Because I'm pretty easygoing, so it's usually, you know, whatever he wants to do, it's fine with me. But I'm worried that by constantly being flexible, I'm not living the life I choose.
As a patient, I've been discussing my relationship with my partner. I talked about how sometimes I ask him for small practical things like picking up something from my favorite restaurant, and he bought me earrings without needing to ask.
I'm struggling with how to ask for what I want because I am a very practical person, and I don't know how to be impractical. I don't think my family would understand if I made decisions a little more focused on what I want, as they are very practical too.
I'm struggling with the idea of life being practical. I feel like big decisions need to be practical, otherwise they can waste time and money. But I'm not sure if there are any non-practical decisions that can add value to my life.
I'm struggling with the idea of pursuing a degree, but I'm also focused on my family and how my partner might feel about my potential changes. I'm worried that my partner might feel intimidated by my changes and I'm not sure how to talk to them about it.
I felt that my previous therapy sessions were really Western and didn't consider my Asian American background. The sessions lacked a logical progression and seemed to bounce back and forth. It didn't address family dynamics and focused more on me as an individual.
I felt frustrated during my previous session with a counselor because I couldn't answer the questions the way he wanted me to. He seemed frustrated too and kept repeating questions in different ways, trying to get me to see something. It felt like a circular conversation, with a back-and-forth like a tennis ball.
I felt connected to my therapist because of her body language. The way she used non-verbal cues like nodding and saying 'Mmm hmm' made me feel heard and understood. I can't pinpoint exactly what she did though.
As the patient, I feel conflicted because I like peace, but sometimes I can't have what I want.
Lately, I just want to be left alone, even from my close ones like Lauren and Ryan. I actually enjoy going to school and learning new things, but I don't know what to do with my degree. I find it fun, but I'm unsure if my partner understands how much joy it brings to me.
I want to start a family with my partner now that we're financially stable, but I also want to go to school. I think it's impossible for me to have both a family and continue my education. I don't have any friends who have successfully managed both.
I don't have any close friends who have both a career and a family. I feel like if I had gone to college right after high school, I would have been able to pursue my dreams and start a family later. But now I feel like time has passed, and I'm struggling to pinpoint what exactly my dreams are.
I got married to my husband when I was 18, and we've been together for almost 10 years. I struggle with understanding my values and what it means to be a good wife or partner.
I've been practicing mindfulness and I find it hard to focus sometimes. It feels like it requires more effort than just relaxing and sometimes I get frustrated with myself for not being able to focus. Is this normal?
I recently tried mindfulness practice and enjoyed it, as it helped quiet my mind. Now, I am struggling to find a suitable time to incorporate mindfulness into my daily routine. I already pray at night before going to bed.
I'm working Monday through Friday, and I'm looking for suggestions to manage my time during the week.
During my meditation, I noticed I was more aware of noise and internal noise like my tummy. Also, there were a bunch of thoughts coming into my mind, but I was able to redirect without beating myself up and reminded myself to be kind.
I recently read an article about using a mantra for meditation. I thought of using 'breathe peace' as my mantra, but I'm not sure if it's the right one for me. I find it difficult to focus on my breath while meditating.
I think I got like, probably the last few seconds, probably five, I don't know, the last few seconds in this like blank state. It was interesting.
I recently experienced a moment where my mind was extremely quiet and time seemed to fly by. It felt wonderful, like I was in a state of peace.
I've been practicing mindfulness meditation, and I notice it can help me develop self-compassion. However, sometimes I lose focus and feel frustrated with myself. Some people suggest envisioning a bubble to let those thoughts float away, but I still struggle with refocusing my attention.
I recently learned that regular mindfulness practice can change the physical structure of the brain, and that serious meditation practitioners, such as Buddhist monks, have thicker prefrontal cortexes than the rest of us. Can you explain why this is the case and how it impacts the functioning of the brain?
I've heard about the fight-flight-freeze mechanism, and I am curious about how mindfulness can help me manage my stress response. Will I be able to stay calm more effectively?
I have been practicing mindfulness to manage stress, and it's become easier for me to deal with minor issues. However, when it comes to certain situations, like dealing with my boss, I still find it challenging to remain calm and not get stressed. Is that normal?
I've been doing good this week, way much better, and I'm interested in learning more about mindfulness since I've been thinking about it for some time.
I recently read a magazine article that talked about depression and relapse. The idea of relapse in depression concerns me.
I have been feeling down lately, and I know that the relapse rate for depression is quite high. I came across some professionals mentioning mindfulness as a way to reduce the relapse rate. Can you tell me more about that?
I'm Catholic and I've heard that mindfulness meditation is related to Buddhism. Is there any similar practice in my religion to mindfulness?
I feel like taking notes on the differences between Buddhist and Christian mindfulness, as I get confused with all those words and thoughts going through my mind.
I wanted to tell you about mindfulness and how we should practice it. I think it's about being present and aware of what's happening in this specific moment, like focusing on my breath. Additionally, I believe we should practice it without judgment and even with compassion.
I found it helpful to track my progress with a checklist to keep me motivated. I was wondering if we could incorporate this into our regular sessions from now on.
During our conversation, I expressed my excitement and gratitude to the counsellor for their help. I am looking forward to seeing what happens next week.
I have been trying to practice mindfulness meditation by focusing on my breath, but my mind keeps wandering off and producing language and thoughts. What should I do when I notice my mind wandering?
I've done relaxation before, but never tried this type of meditation. I like the idea of saying 'yes, and that too' when my mind wanders off during the session. Do you have any other tips or advice for doing this meditation?
As a patient, I've been practicing putting my negative thoughts into a bubble and letting them go. I'm also trying to focus on my breath and not beat myself up over my thoughts.
I recently tried a meditation app for the first time with my counsellor. We set the timer for 60 seconds and I sat in a comfortable position. When the time was up, I felt like the meditation session went by too quickly.
I just tried meditating for a minute, but it felt like it was only five seconds.
I am having trouble fitting meditation into my daily schedule, and I worry about whether I am spending enough time on it. I find it challenging to find a suitable time for meditation and I become anxious thinking about if it's time for me to get up or if I'll be late for work.
I've been learning about Christian and Buddhist meditation practices. They both focus on present moment awareness and the breath. I find it interesting how our brains like the predictable rhythm of breathing. I'm about to try meditation for the first time, but I know that mastering it will take a lifetime, just like parenting.
As a patient, I'm looking for a way to incorporate mindfulness into my daily routine. I mentioned that I'm too busy in the mornings and just running around, but I never skip my praying routine at night.
I'm pretty disciplined and try to make time for reading spiritual texts like the Bible. However, I find it difficult to maintain a consistent practice. Do you have any suggestions?
I've been thinking about advocacy, personal history, and privilege in relation to the work I choose to take on. I feel like these concepts are tied together and influence the job I have in my community-based program.
When I think about my job, I feel a mix of emotions. I think of opportunity, productivity, and growth, but I also feel fatigue and an increased need for self-reflection and self-monitoring.
I have been out of school for two months and work has been coming and going. My day-to-day experience is mostly stress related to work and the decisions I have to make for my work, like where I want to work and what I want to do. However, when reflecting on this, I see it more as an opportunity rather than stress. I also feel a sense of urgency and being rushed.
I'm not out to my parents, and I've done some queer-related work in the past. It's hard to talk to them about working for an LGBT health office or a queer-organizing group, as they don't even know that I am queer. There are a lot of barriers.
I've been allowed to make many decisions on my own and have been relatively independent, but I didn't receive a certain level of support from my parents. What I really want from them is...
I've been independent since I moved here for school four years ago, and I don't seek financial support. I want my family to acknowledge and understand me. In our family of five kids, my eldest sister and I are usually called in to support our parents during a crisis. We are the even-numbered children.
As a patient, I have been thinking about the roles my spouse and I play as parents. We have five kids, with ages five, three, and one. It feels like we're the secondary parents, and I wonder if there's any relevance to the even versus odd numbered kids.
I think it's funny how my family wanted me to come back to Boston after I graduated because I didn't have a job. However, I was able to find enough freelance jobs and also worked in community health and freelanced in theater, something I do on the side as a senior technician. How might the difference between my situation and my siblings' situations be influencing how I feel?
I had a stable income and wanted to stay in New York because of the opportunities, my life, and how it feels like my new home. However, my siblings don't understand why I decided to stay here, and I think they would support my work but not fully understand it. My parents were the same, but they always encouraged us to be independent in making decisions.
I've always had my parents' guidance throughout my life, though they never quite understood what I do. They've never stopped me from making decisions, but I've faced some negative feedback from them. However, I don't feel like I have their support all the time, and I wish I could talk to them more openly about my work like my siblings can.
As a parent, I feel like my spouse and I don't really understand why our son is choosing to do social kind of work.
I have been working in the HIV/AIDS field since I was 14 years old, and now I have two part-time jobs in related fields, one at a community-based clinic, and the other as a part-time consultant intern. I have been working on these jobs for two months, and my work schedule is 20 hours a week. My parents have always kept multiple jobs, and it seems like I'm following in their footsteps.
I'm working in HIV/AIDS and have been doing intensive prevention education, community outreach, and advocacy work with queer Asian Pacific young people. I've recently shifted to a more data and research-oriented role in the same organization. It allows me to stay involved in the work and explore something new career-wise. I needed to leave my previous position as I'd had enough of it, although the program is functioning well.
I am in public health and I find that I need to become more familiar with number data, but my academic training was in anthropology, which is mainly qualitative. I'm unsure how to approach this new realm.
I grew up in a close-knit Vietnamese family. My parents worked a lot, so they weren't always around, but my older brother and eldest sisters took on parental roles, raising me and keeping our family connected.
I became my little brother's caregiver when he was born, which influenced my decisions growing up and now. I see a lot of mirrored behavior in the way I was raised and how I handle situations now, learning from my parents and older siblings.
Growing up, my parents worked a lot of different jobs. My mom worked at a candy factory and a fish gutting place, while my dad was a migrant worker in the south, working with shrimp and fish. They later settled in Boston where my dad started working in hardwood flooring.
My mother used to work in dry cleaning, and eventually, my parents had enough money to open their own small dry-cleaners. This was a common job for Vietnamese people in Boston at the time, and they have been working there for the past eight or ten years.
I want my parents to acknowledge the meaning of my work and my dedication in their eyes. They understand the importance of social-oriented work, but they don't understand why I should be doing it. I think this issue is related to them not knowing about my queer status.
I have been involved in social work and activism, but my family doesn't seem to understand why I am doing it, even though they grew up working poor and on welfare. Because of this, I feel like they see me less often. I don't think there's a direct connection between my sexual orientation and their lack of understanding, as not all my work is queer-based.
I am struggling to understand how my sexuality affects other aspects of my life, like my decisions and relationships with family and work. I don't think it is a direct impact, but rather a part of many pieces that influence me.
I am afraid of losing my parents, not in the sense of losing their presence in my life, but more of them cutting me out and me not being able to support them. I worry about the decisions I make, especially in my career, as I feel that maintaining my role and expectations for my parents is a significant part of my identity.
I want my family to understand that my work, like their work, is about survival and taking care of my family, but it also has a different meaning for me. It's about making something of myself, making my own life, and staying committed to what I care about.
Lately, I have been struggling with balancing different aspects of my life including my Asian family, my queer family, and my work on HIV/AIDS prevention. I find it challenging to manage all these expectations and maintain a sense of identity within various communities.
I recently graduated from my undergraduate program and am trying career counseling for the first time. I grew up in a working-class, primarily Latino immigrant neighborhood in Boston with a close-knit family of five kids and two parents who are still together.
I grew up in a primarily Latina-Latino neighborhood, but my family is Vietnamese. We came as refugees, and my older siblings experienced the move as well.
I was the first one born here. I was a refugee about 23, 24 years ago. I'm the fourth of five children. My eldest brother is 12 years older than me, and I have two older sisters, one who is seven years older and another who is two years older. I grew up very close with her. And then I have a younger brother who is seven years younger.
I've been facing a dilemma on how to share my life choices with my family, as I've kept secrets from them about my sexuality, career, and relationships. I was considering lying to them about accepting a job at NYU, but recently decided that living a lie isn't healthy nor productive.
As a patient, I'm struggling with whether to tell the truth and come out, which is a very scary decision for me. It might affect the closeness with my parents, but I understand that like most parents, they want what's right and best for their children.
I feel really torn because I think my family has a different idea of what's best for me than what I want. If I told them I took an HIV/AIDS job, they wouldn't cut off communication, but they'd nag me about it every time I came home or called over the phone. They'd be very passive-aggressive about it.
I've been thinking about coming out to my family, but I'm worried that when I do, they might cut me out on a close level or even completely cut me out of their life. However, I also think there's a chance I will continue to be part of the family.
I feel that my decision-making and goals are different as I seek security for myself and my siblings because I identify as queer and never really hoped to have children. My family priorities are different and security is still an important goal for me.
I identify as queer and I'm gay. I have issues, relations, and relationships exclusively with men. I use the word 'queer' because it means a lot more for me and it's shorter than saying gay or LGBTQ.
I think my life is different because of my sexuality. I choose my relationships based on that and it affects how I run my life. I understand marginalization on a deeper level, as I am gay and my family is straight. My long-term goals in life are different, as they don't involve getting married or having kids, which is not very heteronormative.
I've known that I was queer or gay since I was about 12. Ever since then, I have been pretty open about it with my friends and coworkers, but not my family. I eventually told my sisters and older brother, but I haven't told my younger brother yet.
I'm struggling with an issue and I haven't told my close friends or parents about it. I'm not sure how they would react and it's causing me anxiety.
As a patient, I want to share about my parents who are Vietnamese refugees. They worked a series of jobs, and now they have their own dry-cleaning business. They have an extremely strong work ethic, coming from their Vietnamese values and being political refugees. I wonder how their survival and the need to support their large family influenced their work style.
I think my parents' decisions to relocate to the US and the jobs they took have influenced my views on work. They had traditional priorities and their main focus was to provide security for our family, which is something I try to apply in my life as well, but with different priorities.
I've recently told my family that I work on an HIV/AIDS CBO, which is culturally taboo for them. I used to avoid specifying where I worked or gave an alias, just mentioning it was in the health field. After revealing the truth, my family became very upset.
I'm really grateful for my siblings' support, but they're quite upset about me working in HIV/AIDS related field instead of something like cancer research. They worry about me becoming HIV positive or catching AIDS. I'm currently working part-time with an HIV/AIDS CBO in addition to my position at NYU School of Medicine.
I am concerned about the stigma associated with working in community-based HIV programs as opposed to more academic settings like NYU.
I think it translates very directly. I understand where they are coming from but I can't help but feel a little hurt by the way they would like me to set my priorities as opposed to where I set my priorities. I think it's very clear and the feeling to me is very visceral. I just got this part-time position that I know will become full-time very soon if I choose for it to be.
I've been feeling like there's a disconnect between how I see myself and how others see me. This seems to be influencing their inability to understand why I'm drawn to a particular line of work.
I feel like I had to create a division between my public life and my private life in many ways, and I've done the same thing before.
I feel close to my parents, but there is a division between us. Recently, they have mentioned that they want to move in with me and my family, and they expect me to provide for them.
I work in the non-profit sector, and my finances are a bit scarce, but if my partner decided to move in with me and expected financial support, I would take it on. I'm not sure how to talk to my parents about my career choices, given my field and my queer status.
I have always kept a division between my private life at home and my public life everywhere else. I've been working in HIV/AIDS work for six years now, but my family only found out about it and my close personal experience with it a year ago when I started working with an HIV/AIDS Community Based Organization.
I didn't really like school, so I found motivation by doing things I cared about, like working in Asian-American, Vietnamese, and queer communities. Now, I'm working in an HIV/AIDS community.
I've been working as a peer counselor with young people, particularly queer young people, for a year now in a prevention education organization. As of today, I've transitioned into a part-time staff position coordinating the agency's participation in an international research study, which is related to the work I've been doing at the agency.
I've been working on data crunching for a new position and also working with a research institute, focusing on health disparities. They're trying to establish community health initiatives in various ethnic communities. They brought me onboard to start an initiative in the Vietnamese community. We are working on coalition building among different community partners, and eventually doing health program activities, but we don't know exactly what yet.
I often feel rushed, anxious, and stressed about making decisions in life, and I've noticed that my siblings seem to be going through similar experiences. My youngest brother is in high school, while my eldest brother is in business, and my older sister is an architect.
My other sister is a schoolteacher and my parents have set professions. They don't really understand what I do in terms of my community organizing background, particularly around public health, and they don't know why I'm doing it.
I have an older brother who majored in business and went straight into the business investment field, but I don't really understand what he does. My sister is an architect who majored in architecture and has been working for three years after completing her master's. I also have a sibling who is a teacher.
I went to a Liberal Arts college and majored in Education and History. I'm now teaching History. Lately, I've been feeling stressed and anxious, and it seems like I'm always in a rush. My parents don't quite understand what I do or how it relates to my education.
I'm currently working in two part-time positions, and there's another part-time opportunity available. Both of my current jobs want to give me a full-time position, but I've been delaying the decision for the security of a full-time job to explore other opportunities. Lately, I have been feeling stressed about balancing these options and making a decision.
I've recently graduated from college and I've been feeling anxious and stressed about deciding which direction to go in my life. I'm hesitant to make a decision too soon and I want to get as much exposure as possible. Also, I've been thinking about how my siblings' careers relate to our upbringing.
I'm feeling uncomfortable compared to my siblings who all seem comfortable.
I am a Vietnamese-American, and I identify as queer and Buddhist. I have been feeling some uneasiness and would like to discuss how these different aspects of my life may be contributing to the issues I am facing.
I've recently graduated from undergrad and am currently freelancing in community help and organizing work. I've never been to career counseling, and I'm starting to have a lot of questions about decisions I need to make for my future.
I recently graduated and I know I have to work. I've been fortunate that a number of opportunities have presented themselves in my field, as opposed to having to go do something else than what I trained for. So, I became interested in seeking counseling to understand my options and what my next step should be.
I've always had my personal life and professional life entwined, which also happened when I was in school. I studied refugee migration, wrote my thesis on the Vietnamese community, and did gender and sexuality studies. I've always practiced and performed my own identities through my work.
I didn't get a job I wanted, but it led to some benefits like exercising more and getting involved in video shoots for the city. I found similarities between that past frustration and my current situation. Lately, I've been feeling frustrated, but I'm willing to look for potential meaning in these frustrations.
I've been working on a project and I have a lot of experience, but no one is listening to me. I'm trying to save the project, but now I'm in EAP talking to you. I've been through similar frustrations in the past. I was once passed up for a promotion, even though I was more qualified than the person who got it.
After reflecting on a past situation where I didn't get a job, I realized that I wasn't ready for it. I wouldn't have been able to handle it, as I lacked maturity and experience. When I thought about the challenges the person who got the job faced, I understood that it was actually a positive outcome for me not to get the job back then.
I feel like someone is constantly marking my work in red and judging me, as if they have all the answers. It's making me feel insecure and doubtful about my own abilities.
I've been struggling with feeling like I need to be a superwoman, always trying to do everything perfectly and taking on all the responsibilities. But I also feel like I'm failing and can be seen as a stupid woman, too. What should I do to overcome this?
I feel like I'm trying to push myself too far, trying to do too many things and not really stepping back to think about what I really want. I'm putting too much pressure on myself, trying to do everything perfectly.
I've been putting too many expectations on myself, not necessarily coming from others but mainly driven by my own beliefs. As a professional woman, I have various responsibilities, such as being a mother and a wife, along with other roles that I play in life. I feel like I keep adding to my own agenda.
I've come to you because I think you're great and helpful. Lately, I've been feeling so stressed out trying to do it all - being a mother, a wife, a professional, working in the school system, pursuing additional education, and keeping up with my husband's activities. It just feels like too much.
I was trying to serve some orders and snacks to the people at my place, but I realized that I haven't gone shopping and there wasn't even any food in the house. I was embarrassed as I couldn't do it all and thought maybe you could help me sort these things out.
Lately, I've been struggling with trying to do everything on my own, like how people expect superwomen to be. When I step back and look at it, I realize it seems simple to just delegate tasks or not overcomplicate things, but I often find myself stuck in a corner.
I feel like I've gone through so much and continue to be affected by it. It's almost like I'm addicted to it. I do all these things and people still expect more from me because I handle everything so well. But I keep taking on more tasks and it doesn't seem to end.
I've been struggling with the expectations placed upon me as a woman, like wanting to help people and making everyone feel good, and trying to be reverent, chaste, and true. It gets really overwhelming and suffocating.
I feel like carrying bags around on my shoulders, and I am constantly burdened. I don't want to bear up and be revered for it; I want to go through life with a sense of balance and managing things.
Lately, I've been struggling with a balancing act in my life, and at times it feels like everything is tipping too much the other way. Although my life is wonderfully full, and many people might envy me for it, I just can't seem to get a handle on some aspects.
I feel overwhelmed and like I'm moving at a frantic pace. I'm not sure what priorities I should focus on to manage everything going on in my life and environment.
I've been feeling overwhelmed with my responsibilities as a wife, mother, and professional woman. I've realized that my roles as a wife and mother are most important to me and maybe I should consider not taking on so much in my professional role. I think there are tasks that can be delegated, like getting my family to help with food shopping so I don't feel solely responsible.
I just kept saying yes, of course, you know, I can handle that, yes, yes, yes, and I think the answer is to say no to things. I think that we are family, and a good family team, and I think we need to all sort of step back...
I've been struggling with saying no to things, both at work and in my personal life. I realize that I need to ask for help and set boundaries by stating what I can and can't do, but it's been really hard for me.
I'm worried about maintaining my boundaries without seeming cold in a new environment where I'll be living to be there for someone. It's hard for people there to understand boundaries sometimes, and I want to ensure I take care of my own needs while not coming across as cold or distant.
I'm worried about managing money in a society with less physical cash. I'm going to a place where I won't have a lot of expenses, but I'll need to learn how to invest and save properly. I also don't know how to interact financially in this new environment, and my friend expressed the same concerns about the lack of ATMs.
Lately, I have been thinking about how some of the simple daily activities that I took for granted, like going to McDonald's to get a coke, will be so different now.
I think some roadblocks may be because the hope preparing has been a little ambiguous regarding what I'm going to be walking into. My expectations for where I'll be living and how close I'll be in contact with the students might not be met. I think I'm going to be right in the residence hall, but if that changes, the living accommodations might cause me stress. I've called a couple of times and have been told about several different living accommodations, each with their pluses and minuses.
I've been struggling with maintaining boundaries in certain situations, especially when I feel like I need to say no. I've tried to think of ways to manage it, like finding time during the day when others won't be around, so I can do some things for myself.
I was reflecting on the loss of support from a loved one, and I think that's why I've been feeling and projecting feelings of loss. The support they provided was very clear to me, and talking about the ways they supported me has been helpful. I miss them and I know I always will.
I think terminating and saying goodbyes are always hard things for me. I feel sad about it, but I've been able to work on preparing mentally for the loss of our counseling relationship. While I am more prepared than I was before, I still hope that the work we did here will make a difference for me and help my transition be a smooth one.
Yeah. I thought a lot about the checklist last week as far as making sure that I am ready to help students and keeping them in my mind. Even just talking in here, it feels like an opportunity for me to grow professionally and personally. At times, I felt this situation was imposed on me, and I was confused about leaving what I have built before.
I know I have built some lasting relationships during my time here. I am worried about how these relationships will grow while I am absent. It's going to be harder for me to continue to grow with them, but I believe it's still possible.
I've been working on preparing to leave and say goodbye, which is a major goal I've developed here. Sometimes, I struggle with either-or thinking and I feel like I have it all figured out in terms of relationships. But I'm also learning that there's still growth in those areas.
I'm realizing that I'm a person in process and don't have to be perfect in my relationships. I've also noticed that despite my upcoming move to Alaska, the bonds with my family, especially my nephew, might grow stronger as a result. This could be a growth opportunity for me to understand them better.
I can talk to my mom a little bit better now, and it's very positive for me. Losing her support has opened up a line of communication that we had previous to me putting up barriers. It's easier for me to go up to her and truly tell her how I'm feeling, like if I'm having a bad day or if I'm thinking about something too much.
I have been feeling a lot of stress trying to protect someone, but recently that stress has been relieved. I've realized that I don't have to protect them anymore and that I can focus on the excitement and adventure of my choices. However, I still struggle with seeing things as either-or situations.
I recently noticed that I have a tendency to think in either-or terms, and I've been trying to stop that. Just the other day, I caught myself doing it again and laughed at myself for doing it. I never realized I had this issue, but it has come up in multiple situations.
I've been feeling lonely lately, and I remember there was a book chapter on loneliness that I've read. I don't have it with me right now since I sent it to Alaska, but it's something I could use as a reference.
I've been studying counseling for a long time and I'm excited to finally be able to do what I've been learning on a daily basis. I'm also looking forward to everyday interactions with people at a school or Residential Center. However, I sometimes question whether I'll be what I need to be to do my job well.
I feel like I'm good at staying connected, and I put energy into that. I'm considering mediation, maybe not so much with adults, but I think it's important for students.
I've been feeling more ready for the challenges coming my way, and it's been really nice to feel this optimism and support from others.
I have been trying to be more thoughtful and planned about the things I purchase because I can't just run out if I run out of something like my favorite soap. I think this is a skill that I need to work on.
I'm very thankful that I was able to meet with you and talk about this. I feel that I am much better prepared than I was even five weeks ago, mentally prepared. Now, I need to physically get prepared and keep thinking about the positives that are going to come out of this as I prepare to say goodbye.
I recently moved to Alaska and I'm feeling overwhelmed. But, I do have Charlene whom I live with, and she's been a good support. My other friends and family also seem to be rallying around me. But I'm still feeling anxious and lonely.
I do have numbers of other counselors working in residential high schools, and addresses of two LPCs in Galena. I have also considered journaling, which I found helpful in the past as a good outlet when there's no one to talk to.
I'm good at debates when I'm against someone I know from my class, but I feel embarrassed talking about it.
I have a habit of moving on to the next thing and not enjoying my accomplishments. I don't want to be one of those people who brag all the time.
I think I should practice in the morning because sometimes I feel frazzled, thinking about all the stuff I have to do that day. Definitely before a test, and maybe at night as well, hoping it will help me get better sleep than I've been getting recently.
I have been practicing deep breathing exercises to help with my anxiety. I understand the technique and can feel it working, but I am unsure whether I should do it in silence or with music in the background. Additionally, I'm worried about my friends noticing and thinking I'm weird.
I feel like when people compliment me, it's not totally genuine. It's like when you were younger and on a soccer team, and someone messed up a goal but everyone said they did great. I feel like, when I get praised, people are just trying to make me feel better, even if I didn't really do well.
I'm kind of proud of my accomplishments such as debate, but I don't really want to brag about it. I really like doing it, but when I first start thinking about it, I get really nervous.
I think about how important the test is, how it's gonna mess everything up if I don't do well. I just feel like if I don't do well on my tests then, it's kind of stupid but I feel like my future is, is kind of bleak and it's going to go on a downward spiral from there.
I'm worried that if I don't do well on this test, it'll lead to a downward spiral where I might fail multiple tests, classes, get kicked out of sports and club activities, and eventually have to drop out of high school. I feel like I would be a disappointment to my parents who have done so much for me, and I want to be the perfect daughter they deserve.
I feel pressured from my parents' expectations of me and comparison to others, especially when my dad talks about his friends' children who get straight A's and get into Ivy League schools.
I just started high school and it's been exciting, but it's also different. Everything is new, like new friends and a bigger school.
I recently moved to a new school, and I'm finding the classes to be tougher. The teachers seem to have a different style, and I feel like they don't care so much. I am also worried about the tests.
Whenever I think about taking a test, I start to feel anxious. I want things to be different this time, but as it gets closer, I find it hard to eat, sleep, and even breathe sometimes. My palms start to sweat, and I'm only averaging about five to six hours of sleep because I keep thinking about the test the next day.
I start noticing anxiety when I have a quiz, usually when I walk into the classroom or during the periods building up to the quiz.
I feel like I have to set high goals and have high expectations of myself to achieve what I want. It seems like I constantly have to try hard while my friends don't have to. I'm often called a control freak as I try to anticipate things prior to when they happen.
I like planning everything and setting up study schedules to make sure everything is perfect. It gives me a sense of security and control over my life. When I don't plan, I tend to get more anxious.
I think I kind of want, you know, the same thing my parents want for me. I want to be that perfect person, like the characters in the movies; beautiful, smart, popular, with a perfect boyfriend, and everything just going my way. But I can't get there, no matter how hard I try. I spend a lot of time thinking about it and barely get any sleep.
I feel like I have so many high expectations for myself, and when I look at others it seems like they have it all and things are effortless for them. I have this idea of how I should be in order to feel good enough, but I worry that I'm being too hard on myself.
I tend to blow things out of proportion sometimes, and it gets really overwhelming for me. I feel like my flaws are more visible, but there have been good things happening to me, like going to homecoming with the person I wanted to and being nominated for homecoming princess.
Today I got caught up in school and everything. Sometimes, it seems like the things that are wrong or what I look back on my day. Even though there might be ten things that go really well and I do well, it's the one thing that is off that I focus on. This makes me feel horrible, and I think I should be more thankful, but sometimes I feel like people are just saying it to say, you know?
I have been feeling really anxious and shaky lately. I also experience tightness in my throat when this happens. I am not sure how to properly use deep breathing to help with my anxiety.
As the patient, I have been practicing the deep breathing technique you taught me. I'm placing one hand on my stomach, breathing in through my nose, feeling my stomach expand, and breathing out through my mouth slowly. However, I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly or if this will help me feel less anxious.
I recently tried some deep breathing exercises that reminded me of yoga classes I've attended in the past. After practicing the exercises for a short time, I could already feel my body relaxing.
Sometimes, I get nervous in situations like being in class or hanging out with friends, and I notice a tightness in my throat.
I feel like my mom has high expectations of me, and it seems to be putting extra pressure on me and stressing our relationship. I want her to be proud of me, but I think my stress may be affecting us both. I would be open to her joining a session to discuss these feelings.
I have been experiencing tightness in my throat and feeling shaky when I get more anxious. I have tried yoga a couple of times with my friends as a relaxation technique.
I recently joined a team, and our coach recommended practicing some breathing patterns at the beginning and end of our sessions. I am willing to learn these breathing techniques in more depth.
I've had moments where I slipped up, like I read the wrong chapter or studied the wrong material. I've gotten a C on reading quizzes before and I was annoyed, but everything worked out in the end. However, I still worry that if something goes wrong again, it might be the end of the world.
I'm having a hard time with my mom teasing me about a lot of things, and I feel like it's a snowball effect, where one thing leads to another.
As the patient, I realize that I need to control myself better when dealing with conflicts and not just burst out and slap people. I also acknowledge that I should work on my anger issues in other situations as well.
I did nothing wrong, I just walked into the cafeteria and my friend started yelling at me. We got into an argument over something really stupid, and all I did was just slap her. I still think she was in the wrong, but maybe I shouldn't have slapped her.
I was really angry and ended up slapping her, which I shouldn't have done. Now, I think I should have talked things out instead, and we were both in the wrong. I want her to apologize, but I think I should also apologize to her.
Well I think, I should take more of the responsibility for now and I need to go apologize to her and, uhm, really handle myself better, even if she did say something that really made me angry, I should not have slapped her at all.
I came out in 2006 and faced several barriers in the Filipino community, feeling alone and dealing with depression. As a lesbian, I feel like I didn't handle it well and didn't explore much.
I have this cultural tendency to view relationships in a straight way, but mine is a different one. I'm facing barriers because I am not only a lesbian, but also a woman, and this affects how the Filipino community sees me.
I feel good like every time I like… every time I organize, I try to give my own experience. And it feels like I feel better talking about it.
I came to share my experiences with you, as it feels easier to talk about them here. I have connections with the people I organize with, but I haven't really had one-on-one conversations with them about my feelings.
As a patient, I just said that I agree with something that was previously discussed, but I didn't provide any details.
I found a community within this organization that supports me. Also, I heard someone's personal story and it made me realize that I'm not alone in the experiences I've gone through.
I still feel a heaviness in my chest when I talk about my experiences from three years ago. It seems like things never really end, and I see new Filipinos coming to this place, going through the same difficulties. I feel the need to do something about it, not just to be a transplant here.
I feel like being a woman, a lesbian, and youth is difficult, especially since I don't have any support in the community. Also, being a Filipino in New York adds to my struggle.
I've had some struggles since coming here because I have difficulty speaking the language. Back home, it was less stressful for me because I could speak our language easily. I also identify as a lesbian.
I'm turning 25 and I'm trying to figure out my career and get settled in life. I'm also focused on finding schools and knowing myself as a whole.
I feel like I'm everywhere right now. I do organizing work in the community in New York, and there's a disconnect between my community and going back to the Philippines. Most of the Filipinos I organize with are middle class, whereas in the Philippines, they're mostly working class. This stress of knowing my identity as a Filipino is making me question who I am.
I moved to the US in 2003 and have been living with my parents since then, except for a year when I tried to be independent but couldn't. My father has been here since the 1970s, and my mother came a year before I did.
I was 17 when I moved here. I feel like I was uprooted from my roots and transplanted here.
I am going to the Philippines on November 22nd and have been gathering data for a documentary about Filipino lesbians living there.
I'm finding it stressful to prepare for my trip to the Philippines in a few weeks because I need to contact subjects there while I'm here in New York. I have been trying to reach them through friends of friends and in the local community.
I'm working on a documentary and I'll be staying in the Philippines for a year. It's too much pressure for me because I'm the only one working on this project, but I'm also trying to find organizations in the Philippines that can back me up.
I have been living in New York for seven years and it has been physically stressful. While it has nurtured me in some ways, I feel like I need to grow more. Going back to my home country where I was raised and born would be easier for me because I speak the language there.
I've been experiencing stress here in the US, mainly related to work and finding a job.
I am feeling better, it feels really good.
It’s like when the first time I left my home in the Philippines, I feel like different… it’s different when you’re already out. And then like, are you really didn’t feel, finding… in finding work or like finding their own space in the house.
I've been living here and it actually gives me an advantage because I feel like I was independent, although I depended on my parents for finances. But now, I have been managing my day-to-day allowance on my own.
When I first came here, it was difficult as I only had my mom and dad and was searching for a community to support me. It was really hard, and for the first few months, we stayed at my aunt's house in Long Island.
I find it really hard to see other Filipinos in my new city. I need to have a car and know my way around just to meet someone for support. When I first came here, I felt so alone and depressed.
I didn't know my dad for like the 17 years of living, and it's weighing on me.
I feel really good about our discussion. It's nice to not only talk about it, but also feel and see myself as a whole person. What is it like for you to talk with me, considering my background as a Filipino, a male, and everything else you know about me?
I was hesitant to go for therapy because in my culture, seeing a therapist is often associated with being crazy. But talking to you, a fellow Filipino, feels good and less intimidating.
I feel better after discussing my Filipino background and the idea of putting others before myself. I am now able to understand the spirit of being Filipino, the reciprocity, kindness, and looking out for each other. I liked the last part of the session, where you summarized everything that I said, and hearing it from you gave me a new perspective on the issue.
I feel like I just talk to you now, but sometimes I say something and then I forget about it, that you know, just hearing coming from other people.
I am trying to focus on knowing myself first before helping others this year. It's always been easier for me to help others, but I realize that it's important to help myself first, like putting on a mask in a plane before helping a child. However, it's hard because my natural characteristics are not like that, but I am trying my best to focus on my health.
I'm trying to focus on myself in my relationship and work on fixing the wounds between my family. I also want to live my life and contribute to the community I'm working with.
I feel really good right now after talking to you, and I think discussing my issue helped me feel better.
I've been experiencing some feelings related to my family for the past few weeks, and I've been trying to compose everything that I feel.
I've been here for a few weeks and when I think about the numbers, it makes me reflect on what I've accomplished and what I've been doing. The more I focus on these numbers, the more depressed I become because it feels like a long time.
I've been struggling with the challenges of staying here and not knowing my family well, like they are broken into different pieces. It's hard to understand, but the past three years have helped me grow and discover different types of Filipinos in the US.
I am a resident worker without any documentation, and I feel like I'm not alone in experiencing all this depression and dealing with various issues.
I was trying to find an organization to connect with others who share the same emotions as me. I found an organization in New York where someone was talking about their experiences and feelings. It made me feel like I wasn't alone and that we have the same feelings.
I recently moved to New York and even though I know everyone is different here, I still feel like I don't belong in this city, and I feel alone.
I feel easier and good to express myself. But recently, I went back to the Philippines for a month and I'm experiencing some of those depressive feelings again.
Whenever I see people in my community, I feel like I don't want to leave. Every time I go back to the Philippines, I feel like I'm leaving them and it doesn't feel good. It feels like I'm leaving someone who is very close to me.
I always think about my family who leaves. Moreover, everyone in my family, especially on my mother's side, tends to leave and it's mostly women. I've been noticing these patterns.
I feel like it's not just my family that experiences struggles. It's tough for us but we are managing. We constantly shift from one place to another and it doesn't feel good.
You know, and then my mom was like working all night also. So it was like… It was like this puzzle for me to… Like you know, put it back together. Even if you’re altogether…yourself broken, yeah.
After facing some difficult times, I felt really alone. To deal with those feelings, I tried to work a few weeks later and looked for a job to keep myself busy. I also spent time going online and talking to my friends back home on the phone, even using all my salary on phone cards.
I don't call my family, but I call my friends because I feel closer to them than my family. I don't believe in the culture in the Filipino family, and our relationship is very aloof. It's hard for me to open up with my family, but with friends, it's easier. Being alone here is really hard.
I faced a lot of challenges when I first moved to the States, like leaving friendships and family back home and adjusting to the new lifestyle here. I kept myself busy, but I still experienced depression for about three years. I would count every minute of the days and whenever I made new friends, they would ask how long I've been here.
I feel like I need to know more about my sexuality because I'm still a baby in terms of that. I want to talk more about it and re-learn myself. I do have conversations with some friends who are also lesbians.
Sometimes we're busy, and we don't have that specific time to just talk about ourselves. It's mostly vice-versa. However, talking with you right now feels good.
I feel vain because I've been focusing on myself and the community I'm working with. It's really different from my usual behavior of putting others before myself and thinking about their needs.
I feel like I'm trying to give like say everything that I... that I experience. It feels weird actually, as I'm not generalizing it for anybody.
I have been feeling my hands getting clammy and I start to wonder, why am I afraid and what am I afraid of? Maybe if I recognize these cues, I can figure out what kinds of situations or things I am thinking or that I am afraid of.
I guess I just want to know what I'm afraid of and understand my emotions better, so that I can apply a strategy to help myself through it.
I have been feeling a constant sense of fear, like I'm not safe no matter where I am. I want to get rid of that feeling completely.
I feel like there are a lot of things I wish I had said to my dad, both good and bad. It's difficult because most of them stir mixed emotions in me.
I tried an experiment with expressing my emotions and felt funny at first but after a while, it felt good to let it out, you know.
I feel like you deserve the credit for the changes I've made in therapy because you made all the good suggestions, and I was just following your advice. I never really thought that I had the freedom to choose something different while growing up, as my dad always enforced his way or the highway.
Well, it's definitely kind of new to me. I don't know if I'm used to that and it's kind of exciting to think about. And at the same time, I guess it's a little bit scary because it's like, well, I'm on my own, you know?
I never had the chance to express some of the things I wanted to say to my dad. I'm not sure how it would feel like to do that now, and I guess I'd have to see if you think it's a good idea.
I've been asked to imagine there's a chair with my dad sitting in it and engage in conversation with him as if the counsellor is not here, but I'm not sure what to say or how to begin.
I was really upset when my dad didn't show up to my soccer game when I was younger, and it made me feel like I couldn't trust him. Now that he's gone, I can't say all these things to him and I guess I kind of miss him. It still makes me angry and sad that he's gone.
I guess, you know, if I really think about it, now that we're talking about it and I've chosen to go for it, it's just really all the areas in my life that I could apply freedom and responsibility to take control. My life is ultimately up to me. It's an exciting thing to think about.
Recently, I've been struggling with some personal issues, but after talking through things and working on them, I feel a bit better now.
I've grown up with my mom constantly telling me what to do, what to wear, and how to act. I can't imagine anything different, but when she doesn't tell me what to do, I feel troubled and anxious because I'm afraid I won't do things right.
I feel like I want to check with people just to make sure I'm doing the right thing. I want to check with you, my principal, and my new friend to see how things are going.
Lately, I've been feeling something heavy inside me that I can't explain, and I think it's in my heart.
I've had a terrible week. My dishwasher broke, the sewer backed up, and I've been struggling with my job. My principal suggested a new approach, but I'm not sure how it's working. Additionally, I got into a new relationship, but it's hard to connect with my new friend because he's always so busy.
I've been trying to improve my current situation, and I think I'm making progress. However, I would like to explore my family background and the possible impact it has on me. I remember some aspects of my family life, but not everything is clear.
I feel like I can't express my need for dependence and support. Growing up, my parents were very busy with their careers, and I needed them to be there for me. My dad had a newspaper and radio station, while my mom was involved in various organizations.
I remember being around seven or eight years old, coming home from elementary school after playing with a friend. I wanted someone there to talk to and be with me, but even though people were there physically, they weren't really present to talk.
I had a great time playing with my friend at her house, and I loved how her mom was there to talk to us after school. When I come back to my own house, I wish it was like that, with a place to play and my mom waiting for me to talk about our day. But when I get home, it feels empty and there's no one to share my excitement with.
I've been seeing an empty house in my thoughts lately, and it's making me feel uneasy and a bit lonely.
As a child, I often felt alone and had to rely on my own resources. I was good at meeting new people and talking to anyone. I wasn't afraid to leave the house and find others to spend time with.
I used to have real skills in going out and relating with other people. Sometimes, I felt rejected if people weren't ready for me or something wasn't set up. I have been experiencing similar feelings of rejection lately, and I wish I had my mom and dad to talk to.
After 9/11, I wanted to help as I'm trained for it. But my friends and professors advised me against it, being an Arab-American Muslim, worried that it might endanger my own life. Now, I feel helpless as I couldn't contribute to help, and I also feel people might look at me differently because of my background. I avoid airports and flying.
Since September 11th, my life has not been the same from my job to school and everything else. I was close to New York City when the incident happened and it has greatly impacted my experiences.
I wanted to help people in my city because I have a Master's in Marriage and Family Therapy. But when I was about to go and help, many people in the community told me not to because I am a Muslim from Iran. I moved here with my parents at the age of 12. I felt frozen and couldn't do anything, which made me sad and disappointed.
I'm struggling with the fear and trauma that Arab-looking or Muslim-looking individuals experience when being asked to step off of airplanes, and I'm wondering how we can come together as a community and heal from this situation.
I have a clean slate and that's how I look at all kinds of people. But I fear that the September 11th incident had a huge impact on our society and I'm afraid that people will have a different mindset about Muslim-Americans and Middle Eastern Americans. I worry that our kids and families won't get the help they need and it will just be a big cycle.
I am afraid that something deep down is not letting therapists to extend their complete helping hand. Like when I was in 11th grade, during the Persian Gulf war, I saw this from my teachers, professors, friends, and counselors. They wanted to help, but it was different. Mr. Jones was not the same Mr. Jones I knew before the war.
I decided to do my Ph.D. and received a great scholarship from Iowa, but the decision was hard, and it hasn't been easy. I've had discussions with my mother and siblings, and I feel quite lonely here.
As a patient, I'm finding it difficult to adjust to the changes in my life after moving to a different place, especially when it comes to being away from my close-knit family. Even though I received support from my faculty, the decision to move was hard. I am from a small town where I used to visit my family often during weekends. But now, I feel like I've let go of something important.
I feel encouraged by my parents, especially my father, to go to school. They're really proud of me. But, even though they're happy for me, I still miss them a lot.
I'm a new student on campus and this is my first semester. I'm really committed to my graduate program and I want to finish on time. However, I've been here for two to three weeks and already started to feel that little things are happening in my personal life, which might interfere with my academics. I don't want to lag behind because finishing on time is very important for me.
I'm struggling with some issues since coming here for graduate school. Making the decision was difficult as I had to leave my family, friends and the easy life I had in Arizona. I'm not talking about academic problems, but more about how I feel emotionally.
I'm from Arizona, and I have a strong Latino support group back home. One of my professors really believed in me and pushed me to pursue my goals, saying that I have the brains to do it.
I feel isolated in my current environment, and it's really getting to me. I'm not sure how to deal with it. At my previous university, I had a small group of friends I could talk to, but now it feels like nobody is there for me, except for this one person I met in class. It's been really difficult for me, and I feel sad when I think about it.
I really want to finish school and made a commitment to my family. My goal is to teach history. But I'm just starting and I already feel overwhelmed. I'm worried about how I'll feel in two years, considering it will take at least three or four years to complete my education.
When I first came to this campus as a Latino, I found that there was no Latino culture here. There weren't many students from my background, and I realized that I had to create and promote the culture myself.
I've noticed that since I started speaking Spanish, I've been feeling more emotional. When I go home at night after being at the library, I feel depressed, homesick, and I want to cry. I feel very lonely and sad, and it's really getting to me.
Even in school, I could talk to people in Spanish, but now I can't. People don't look like me, and the food tastes different. Sometimes I think I'm just dumb and maybe I'm not ready for graduate school.
I was the only one from my community who went to university while others went to community college or got jobs. I felt alone but at the same time, I thought I could talk to people like me in classes.
I recently moved away from Arizona and it has been difficult for me. It feels like I'm saying goodbye for a really long time and leaving everything behind. I'm also struggling to adapt to the new environment and miss the support I had back home.
I feel like there's a real separation in my life, but I don't see any connection to continue moving forward.
As a patient, I feel left out and believe that I don't have the same opportunities as my male colleagues. Last week, you asked me to find out if other women in the department are working on grants.
I recently found out that none of the female students, including myself, in our department were asked to make grants. We all went out for pizza, and while discussing things, we felt that we are being left out indirectly. We're not told explicitly to leave, but we feel excluded, like there's a sense of male students getting privileges and attention that female students don't.
I felt good and happy to know that I wasn't the only one who felt like I was being discriminated against because I'm not smart enough. I discovered that the department isn't supportive of female students. We discussed it over pizza, but we really don't know what we can do.
I've been attending a support group once a week and it's been really helpful, but I don't feel comfortable filing a formal complaint. I now have study friends, and it's helped me deal with issues related to male professors and male classmates in our department. However, I'm worried about what could happen if my classmates who are filing a complaint find out that I initiated the support group but don't want to take further action.
I am worried that the other women in my department may feel abandoned if I don't sign on to a formal complaint. I could try talking to them about my cultural background and how it might make working towards institutional change uncomfortable for me, but I think we have gotten close enough that they might be willing to listen.
I'm in graduate school and I feel like I've faced indirect discrimination from my professors. They are really friendly with the other males in my department, and my adviser asked another guy to write a grant. They tend to talk about going to football games together and stuff like that.
I feel like being friends with the professors is giving some students a chance to work on projects that I'm not being asked to do. I don't engage in conversations about football with them, and I'm concerned that not being able to have a friendly relationship with them might affect my academic opportunities.
I haven't really talked about this issue with anyone before because I am not sure if that's exactly what's going on, and I don't want to insinuate something if it's not true.
I don't want you to be my cheerleader and just tell me stuff that you think will make me feel good but is unrealistic. I'd rather you tell me if I'm not smart enough and I'll fail my classes than letting me go through that humiliation.
I feel like you might be the only person who would truly understand my situation. My family has invested a lot in me, and they are very confident in my abilities. They will support me no matter what, but I'm not sure if they really get what I'm going through.
I recently moved from Hawaii to Illinois for graduate school. It's the first time I've ever left home and been away from my family. We can't talk as much as we used to due to the time difference, and I'm having a hard time getting along with people here because they're different. Also, in my program, there are only a few women, but I'm the only person of color and it's predominantly white men.
I think the fact that I'm far away from home and feeling out of place in this new cultural environment might be affecting my academic success. I don't have close people to talk to about stuff, and I'm doing a lot of things on my own, which I'm not used to. I have a big family and lots of friends back in Hawaii.
I've been struggling with deciding whether to continue with graduate school or not, and I need someone to be honest with me. My family members always encourage me, but I need direct feedback from a different perspective.
I'm worried that I'm not doing well in my graduate engineering program, and I don't know if I have what it takes to continue. I had some professors back home who gave me honest feedback and encouraged me to pursue this career, but now I need someone to help me decide if that's still true.
I have been studying in a predominantly white male department, and I often tend to defer to their authority. I am discussing these concerns with my white male counsellor, but it's not a problem for me.
I find it difficult to talk about my culture and why I'm not as verbal in classes as my classmates. I think talking to one of my professors about this would be hard for me. However, there is a woman professor that I get along with quite well.
I think it's important to start discussing my situation with someone I feel comfortable with initially. I want to see if they think I'm as unintelligent as I believe I am compared to other students.
I've been struggling with the difference between my cultural values and the values of the department, making it difficult for me to fit in.
I, along with my friends, went to the Ombud's office to discuss the issues we were facing. They gave us different options, including a formal complaint. Some of my classmates want to go in that direction, but it makes me a little nervous because I don't want to make waves. I am finally starting to get the hang of things and my grades are really getting better, and I don't want to create more problems.
I feel uncomfortable with some things my professors are teaching in my classes and I'm afraid that speaking out against them might create problems for me. What would you do if you were in my situation?
I am struggling with whether to bring up a concern about my department not providing a healthy environment. I want to know what you might do in a similar situation but keeping in mind that we are different people and may make different decisions.
I'm struggling with feeling supported as a woman in science, and I have sought out social support from some female classmates. I am considering creating a women in science support group and maybe talking to a female professor as well.
I am not comfortable talking to the chair of the department about the discrimination I am facing. What are my other options?
I've been struggling to find emotional support and navigate through some institutional issues. I'm not sure where to turn for help.
Sometimes I think my professors and classmates think I'm stupid because they have different expectations about learning than I do. They like people who are outspoken and who speak up in class when the professors try to facilitate a discussion.
As a patient, I feel that in my culture, growing up in Hawaii, people who speak a lot or answer all the questions come across as arrogant or conceited. This has impacted my experience as a graduate student since I find myself not talking as much as my classmates.
I tend to take a longer time to answer questions, and by the time I'm ready to say something, the discussion has already moved in a different direction. I'm worried that my professors and classmates might think I'm not as smart as them because I hardly ever talk. Maybe they think I don't read the assignments or know what's going on.
I have been feeling more comfortable in my friendships and have been exploring different ways of getting to know people. However, I still have some dilemmas in life, like settling down or choosing a career path. I have a supportive family, but I am unsure about the path I should take.
I've been connecting with people in the GLBT community, and I believe my family loves me. I'm in the process of coming out to myself and I need guidance on continuing that journey.
I've been thinking about further support and role models for developing healthier relationships. There's this lady, Laura, who works on campus, and I know she's in a committed relationship. Also, my friend Joey has a steady boyfriend.
I'm struggling to connect with people in my age group because I mostly interact with younger individuals. I haven't met many older people, so it's hard for me to see how I can form deeper relationships with them.
I feel for myself, but I don't know, like I've never really seen what my future could be like with a woman. I don't exactly know what will happen. And right now, I think my most important objectives are to be successful and have job security.
I just want to be happy in life, but I don't see myself being happy with a man. My main objective is to be happy, and it seems impossible when I think about being with a man.
I've been feeling uncertain about various aspects of my life such as relationships, career, and where I live. Everything seems cloudy and in a mist, and I can't quite figure out what it all means. I'm not sure about settling down with someone or having a relationship, and I don't know if there are any career implications.
I am starting to come out to myself more and more every day and building a social life around gay and lesbian people.
I am feeling quite positive about my future and wanted to express my gratitude for your help.
I've been trying not to identify with certain emotions, but it's really hard for me to feel them and then know how I truly feel inside.
I believe it's not something that's made up and I'm trying to make sure it's the real thing before I take the next step, like telling anybody about it or speaking it out to someone.
I don't feel comfortable right now with who I am. When I was in New York before I came to school, I didn't feel comfortable, I didn't feel like I was truly myself... around people I care about... and that starts to make me feel depressed.
I've been feeling really depressed and I decided to come down here to start a new journey and figure out who I really am, so I can change my situation and make it better.
I have been feeling lost and confused about my past, and I am trying to leave that confusion behind and start fresh, embracing my true self.
I'm struggling with finding the right words to talk to my parents about a sensitive issue. I don't know how they will react or if they will come to me. It feels like I'm breaking something to them.
I want to tell my family something important, but I'm afraid of letting them down and disappointing them. I know they'll probably be supportive and still love me, but the thought of their disappointment hurts me.
I'm feeling anxious because I don't want to disappoint my parents. They have certain expectations and visions for my future, and I feel like if I don't meet those expectations, they will be disappointed in me. I also worry about their concern regarding people being negative towards me.
I feel like people have things to say or do to me because of the way I feel, and I think they are concerned for my safety.
I've been feeling anxious lately, especially when thinking about my future. I have this vision of the aisle and the walking down it, representing my past, and it's going to be shifting soon.
When I came to school, my boyfriend was very upset. He thought he was losing his best friend, and as a very sensitive man, different things will set him off. He really misses me a lot.
I have a great relationship with my father, he enjoys my company and treats me like a buddy, not just his daughter. I want to know how and when I should approach him with a certain topic when I go home.
I feel like I might come out to my friends first before I come home, just like a close knit group of my friends and see how that goes. And I'm fairly confident I'll be accepted. I don't know exactly how I will go about doing that though.
I'm fairly confident they will be just from what conversations we've had and how they talk about things like that.
I think we're in the dining room, maybe just finished dinner or something because that's the time when we'll just finished eating and everything's quiet.
I've been feeling anxious about coming out to my parents and telling them I'm gay. I feel like it's important for me to share this part of my life with them.
I just revealed something personal to my parents, and I think they're still in shock and confused. However, I feel good about opening up to them as I believe they'll be supportive. How did I feel about revealing to them and their reaction?
I recently had a conversation where I practiced telling my parents something important, and now I feel like it might be similar to how it would feel to actually tell them. I think they will be accepting and still love me.
I definitely count my parents as the most important things in my life. My biggest fear and worry is to disappoint them and not do what is expected. All of my life, I feel like everything that I've done, they have been so proud of me, and I just would never want to let them down.
I really don't want to disappoint my parents. It hurts me because I feel like that's what I've been doing.
I recently found out that my mother has three lesbian friends and one who is transgender. She hangs out and talks with them, which makes me think that she might be more open and accepting than before. When I was a kid, I remember her condemning such people, but now she seems to have changed.
I always felt like my mother would be more accepting of certain things because she has friends who are different. But now I think it's hard to say that because they're not her child, and I'm her only daughter.
I've been feeling overwhelmed by societal expectations, like how everyone expects me to walk down the aisle with a man, and other similar expectations.
I attended a social event recently. I didn't really talk to anyone and just sat back to take it all in, but I felt like I was making some progress.
I felt a connection with the people around me that was different from my friends and family at home. With them, it felt like I was hiding something.
I went to a social event and even though I didn't disclose anything about myself, I felt accepted no matter what. It was a very positive experience for me.
I felt like I was putting on an act, and I was doing what I was expected to be doing. My biggest issue was all of this is, like my parents are very close to me.
I'm feeling anxious about my future, and I'm also worried about my close extended family. I don't want them to feel ashamed of me in front of the rest of our family.
I want my family to be proud of me all my life, and I don't want that to stop. I'm considering discussing this with them and sharing my feelings.
I have been struggling with approaching my parents about my sexuality. I have come out to my friend Bryan and my roommate recently, but I don't know how to talk to my parents about it.
As a patient, I just said 'Yeah' to the counsellor's previous question.
In the past couple of weeks, I have been reading more materials and hanging out with my gay and lesbian friends. We've been going out, and it has been really enjoyable. I also talked to my parents, and while discussing Mathew Shepard's story, my mom said something that touched me - 'God loves everybody.'
I recently heard my mom talking about accepting gay people and it made me feel more confident. But I still got emotional about it. I'm going home next weekend and I'd like to tell my family about my sexual orientation, but I'm really scared and I don't know how they're going to react.
Lately, I've been struggling to identify my true self and embrace the real me. It feels like I can't connect to an authentic part of myself.
I recently attended a social gathering for the LGBTQ+ community, which was about two weeks ago. It felt really new and strange to me, and even just walking into the event was difficult.
Walking in there for me was very hard. I was kind of worried about who would see me walk in there and who I would be associated with. It was like I internalized this feeling of shame, and I think it's not fair.
I am confused about feeling ashamed because I was told it's not right to feel that way. I believe that if something's a part of me, I shouldn't feel ashamed because feeling ashamed would imply it's wrong.
I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is wrong or not. I used to think it was wrong because of my upbringing, but now I'm questioning myself, as it feels like it's just a natural part of me.
I don't feel like I would chose this...
I have started to connect with people, read about others who share my experiences, and it feels less isolating than before. However, I'm still worried about my parents and my future.
Lately, I've been struggling with my parents' expectations of my future. I used to be able to envision it, but now I can't. I guess it could happen with a woman, but it's different and might never fulfill their expectations. I need to figure out what I want for my future.
I've been struggling with the fact that my future is not what my family wants for me. I love them and respect their opinions, but I have to do what makes me happy.
As a patient, I feel like I am facing a challenging situation where I had to make a difficult sacrifice.
I have been struggling with my own identity and relationships, and I feel like I need guidance from people that are more established and settled. I am considering talking to my friends Laura and Joey about their experiences since they seem to be more comfortable with themselves.
I actually feel like a little bit has been lifted off of me. I feel a lot more accepting of myself.
I've been reading a book that talks about internalized homophobia and it made me realize that I'm going through an internal struggle. However, I feel like discussing it is definitely helping me.
I'm feeling a little bit better now, and it's probably a good feeling. I hope the weight of my problems keeps getting lifted.
I'm struggling to accept that not everyone fits the standard I've set in my mind. Also, every day feels repetitive and monotonous as I wake up at 6:30, eat breakfast, go to work, and leave at 6.
I'm trying to figure out if I do my daily activities, like going home, cooking dinner, and cleaning, because I want to or because I'm just dragging my feet. I'm struggling to find a balance and understand if I'm doing it with the right mindset and focus.
I have been feeling down lately, and I'm wondering if I should change my routine, like working less, staying at home, or becoming more social and going outside more often.
I've only been here for six months and I don't really know the area or the people yet. I think trust is slowly being earned, but there's a fear of rejection and not being able to adapt to the surroundings.
I enjoy going to movies with other people, visiting museums, and engaging in more active activities than staying at home. If I were back in the south, I would do a lot more extracurricular activities with friends of mine.
As an Asian person, I feel that people of Asian descent are very reserved. We don't tend to talk about our problems and just keep working hard even if things don't look right.
I've been feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope with a new situation in my life. I'm not used to these emotions and I don't know how to make things different for myself. I've sought help from my pastor and counselors before, but I want to explore professional help now.
I want to see how I can be helped professionally and explore different approaches that can assist me in finding answers.
I feel like there's a barrier between me and the people around me, especially now when I'm trying to get settled in a new and unfamiliar place. I think my fear of rejection might be one of the barriers.
I've had so little support from family and friends that when it does happen, it's hard and makes it a sensitive and delicate subject. I'm not used to this position where I don't have the support of family and friends and have fewer activities and less enjoyment.
I really want to be busy, do stuff, and serve others, but I don't know how or where to start. Because of this, I end up not doing anything at all.
As a patient, I must admit that talking to strangers is not really our style, I guess. It's quite uncomfortable and overwhelming for me sometimes.
I wanted some guidance on my thought process and habits, which I think are causing me to tire myself out and be in a low mood. Upbringing in church and values taught by my parents emphasize love, humility, and cherishing others, but I feel like this is affecting my emotional experience at work and at home.
I sometimes feel that my workplace doesn't promote values like love and compassion, and that bothers me. I find it hard to be compassionate towards those who aren't compassionate to others. I don't usually join in on conversations where values aren't being promoted, but when I do give my opinion, I'm cautious because I'm afraid of criticism in a large setting.
I am struggling with some disagreements I have about how my co-workers treat one another. I believe in being loving and compassionate toward people, but I'm not experiencing that in my workplace.
Okay, well just a little bit about me first, umm, I grew up in the south and I just came to the middle west for a job opportunity. And, Umm…, of course as you can see, I am of Asian descent. I'm actually the first generation of graduate in college. Umm, but ever since I've moved here, I feel like a little, my mood is lower, my energy level is decreased and, ah, quite often I get irritable.
I recently moved to a new area and came from a place without seasons. Now I'm experiencing snow and a lot of adjustments in America. I'm seeking advice on how to cope with these changes.
Lately, I've been experiencing a lack of excitement and motivation in my life, even for things that are very minimal. At work, I often feel like I'm dragging and not engaged like I used to be. I'm looking for ways to change this and improve my overall mood.
I'm pretty reserved about my feelings, but I think it's more about an individual personal problem. I've been trying to seek social support but nobody at work seems to notice these changes in me.
I'm Kevin, and I am nervous because it's my first time in counseling. I have talked to pastors or counselors in the church before, but never at a professional level.
I recently moved to the Midwest and graduated college six months ago. I've decided to seek counseling through my company's employee referral program. I work as a product coordinator, working with sales.
I've been struggling with the pressure from my development team to initiate the process of producing from raw materials to delivery.
I feel lonely when I leave work and go home. I try to keep my mind busy by turning on the radio, so that I don't fall into a sense of the lack of social support I'm used to having. My symptoms seem to be more intense when I'm at home alone, and I realize that I might have been more irritable at work because of it.
Lately, I've been feeling more irritable than I used to be. I often take things the wrong way, especially when people at work joke around. Sometimes, I take their jokes more seriously than intended, and it's probably because I just don't feel like myself. The jokes don't have any particular theme, but I always take them personally.
I sometimes feel hurt by jokes because I put myself in the situation and take it personally. I have negative feelings towards people becoming judgmental. My family comes from an Asian descent, and they've been in the United States for about 25 years. My father passed away when I was 14.
Recently, my whole family moved to the US, and I am super close with my immediate family members.
Before coming here, I was more excited and eager to learn new things. I was able to go about my day without taking things personally or feeling defensive. However, now that I've moved away from my social support system back home, I find myself being more defensive in my approach to life.
I don't have the same level of social support here as I do at home. My social life mainly consists of conversing with people at work, and I don't know many Asian-Americans here. However, I do attend an Asian-American church.
Since I moved to a new place, I haven't had many Asian-American friends here like I used to have back home. I attend an Asian-American church, but I still feel like I'm missing a social support group. I talk to my friends from back home every weekend, but I think having a social support group from any cultural background would help me.
As a Chinese-American in my workplace, I haven't experienced any bias or negative feedback. My co-workers and associates are very nice and open. They see my work ethic and enjoy my presence. I feel welcomed every day when I come to work.
I have been attending church and participating in religious practices that seem to help me. My parents are pretty traditional in their upbringing.
I come from a Chinese background, and my parents are very strict. They prioritize academics above everything else, and they only want the best for me. While I didn't like it when I was younger, I now see that it has helped me grow and become more mature.
Lately, I have just been feeling that everything around me is too stressful and boisterous. When things get really bad, I don't have suicidal thoughts or anything like that, but I do feel a strong need to just get away from it all and take a vacation.
Lately, I have been feeling overwhelmed and I need to find a way to correct these negative emotions before they get worse. I'm thinking of taking a couple of weekends to fly back to Florida and visit my family, as I might be feeling homesick.
I feel pressure to succeed in my new workplace, especially because I'm the new guy and everyone else has either been here for years or grown up in this city. I feel the need to prove myself and have been putting in a lot of effort to show my supervisors that I have a strong work ethic.
I feel like I'm working really hard to prove myself in the workplace, trying to impress others and make a reputation for myself. I think this has a lot to do with my current feelings of stress and burnout.
I think my social life, the way I interact with others, and even my daily habits could change through counseling. I hope that my perspective will change too, guiding me to make better decisions.
I am feeling that my life needs change in terms of quality of friendships and daily routine. I need to focus more on doing things that don't just involve me or even if it involves just me, I want to be more active and engaged.
I find it difficult to be sociable in my approach, and sometimes it feels hard to reach out to others.
I'm a first-generation college student and my parents work a lot in local retail business. I had to do my homework on my own and the academic standards were very strict. I feel like my main goal is to focus on studies and there's not much else.
Throughout high school and college, I had support from my parents, but it was not physical. They would suggest hiring someone if I needed help, but I felt like I had an opportunity they didn't have. I was blessed and honored with this opportunity that they never had the chance for, and they would tell me stories about how they grew up.
I feel like I had to excel because this opportunity was a once in a lifetime chance. My family has high expectations of me, and they're proud but also expect a lot. They don't want me to live the life they did.
I feel stressed because my parents have worked so hard, 12 hours a day, six days a week, and they never wanted me to have that life. They just expect me to do well in school to give back for their sacrifices.
I feel a bit out of place in this new setting, and I miss my family. Fortunately, we're very open with each other and maintain daily contact.
I've been feeling not quite myself. I told my family that it might be because I'm tired, but they do know that I'm not feeling 100%. I haven't really been discussing my symptoms though.
I've been trying to ignore my negative thoughts and focus on what I'm doing, but it's getting harder to not indulge in my failures or what I want to be. I was born in a Christian church.
I was raised with strong faith in the Bible and I've been devoted to my belief for the past 23 years. I've found a church here that I attend now and I use my spirituality to cope with difficulties or transitions in my life, by seeking strength and encouragement from the Bible, talking with other people in the church and praying.
Lately, I've been struggling with things not going my way, but I'm trying to find strength in that.
I think I'm very open. I'm open at talking to people, I'm open to meet new people, and I actually enjoy doing anything. I'm very adaptable. Maybe, you know, just hanging out, playing cards pool.
As a patient, I believe one of my strengths is that I am very open. I think this helps me in connecting with other people. Another strength I have is that I can rearrange my schedule to make an effort to improve the quality of my life.
I am struggling with a low emotional state right now, and it's really bothering me. I want to change it because it affects me personally, even if it may not affect others around me. I consider myself flexible.
I feel like this conversation has gone very well and beyond my expectations.
I'm not sure what she would say about the situation. She likes people to try much, and she knows them. She might even suggest bringing in someone else to contact them.
I feel anxious because when people don't show up or do something, I think they don't care. But my sister says there could be other reasons, like being on holiday or having other commitments.
I've noticed that someone close to me has been trying to get me out, and I'm concerned about what would happen if things don't work out in our current situation.
I've been struggling with my self-confidence lately, especially when I'm in a low mood. It's difficult for me to try new things and succeed at them.
I still feel quite vulnerable at the moment and I just don't want to get hurt again.
I'm not sure what to do. I'm supposed to call Jose's number, but I have this feeling that I don't want to go.
I'm trying to understand the factors that contributed to the problems in my relationship. My counselor wants me to list these factors and divide them into big and small slices of a pie, based on their importance.
I remember mentioning my husband's long absences due to his job as a salesman. He works for a company which has him away for two, three, or four days in a week. When we were first married, he would try to get back and keep in touch, but these long absences have been happening more frequently.
I've been feeling a lot of pressure in my life lately, mainly due to the demands of my sales job. I recently remembered that my grandfather was a sailor, and his job also required him to be away from his family for extended periods. I'm struggling with the impact of this on my personal life.
I feel like my relationship failure is all my fault. My husband did some difficult things, and I tried hard to make it work, but I still feel guilty.
I am the patient in this conversation, and I'm a bit hesitant about what the counsellor wants me to write down. I feel like if I don't understand it clearly, I might not do it right.
I guess I'm just worried about getting things right in our conversation, and I don't want to say the wrong thing.
I'm feeling a bit nervous about this process, but I'm open to your guidance. Can you just tell me step by step what to do?
I could try doing what you suggested, but I'm a bit unsure about it. I'm worried that if it goes wrong, for example if I text them and they don't respond or they respond negatively, I think I would be really upset.
I haven't heard from some important people and even when I do, they say things which don't feel positive. But I guess I should give this a try since I won't know otherwise.
I'm thinking about a worst-case scenario. I'm not saying it's the most likely, but if something did happen, who could I contact to help me deal with it?
Lately, I've been struggling and I am seeking some positive support. My sister has been helping me.
I have been feeling worried lately, but I am not sure how to handle it. If I try to imagine my friend's reaction, she would probably say 'Look, don't worry about it.' I know she would try to make me feel better by saying something to make me laugh and being cheeky.
I have been feeling low in mood lately and it's making me less active in doing things.
I've been finding it difficult to motivate myself to do anything, so I spend a lot of time indoors because it feels safer in many ways.
Ever since my marriage ended, going out and seeing people has become difficult. It's really upsetting when they pass by without acknowledging me, and I can't help but cry when I get home. I feel isolated.
I used to socialize a lot with my husband's family and their friends, as I wasn't brought up here. But since we've broken up, people have been very different towards me, and I just feel the need to stay by myself.
I didn't feel that I could talk to anyone when we started having difficulties in our marriage, because part of being responsible is accepting that I've got to sort things out myself. I felt I couldn't go crying back to my parents and it was my responsibility to make things work and not to complain.
As a patient, I feel like I have a good quality of being responsible, but sometimes I think I overdo it and become critical of myself. I also struggle with the concept of forgiving myself.
I feel responsible and that's why it's difficult for me to ask for help. I wish I could have done this differently.
I was feeling down last week because I thought everything was my fault and that I had driven my husband away. But now, I think maybe it's my fault, but there could be other factors too. I was brought up as a pretty conscientious person and had to have a lot of responsibilities, as my parents were in Christian ministry.
I grew up in Yorkshire as the middle child of a large family and I felt I had lots of responsibilities towards my younger siblings. There were things that needed to be done and I had to do them, which has always been important to me. I'm not sure if this made a difference in how I was with my husband. On some levels, he shared a similar perspective, but when it came to financial stuff, he didn't feel as responsible.
I'm struggling with my own expectations, especially in my relationship with my husband, who has a very different parenting style than I do. Being responsible is important to me, coming from a faith background.
As a patient, I wanted to talk about two separate issues, and one of them is related to money, which I think is a big issue.
I feel like if my husband's family viewed me differently, I might have been able to cope better in my current situation. Their perception of me has really affected me.
I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I could have made a difference. It's a big realization for me, and I'm not sure how to process this.
When I'm feeling very upset, I tend to think that everything is my fault. I seem to blame myself for the whole situation.
I've never really thought about all the factors of the situation and looking at it this way makes me think that maybe it was all down to me. This thought can be around quite a lot for me at the moment.
When I moved to Cardiff, I didn't have any huge concerns about living in Wales since it's where my husband was from and I thought I would be able to relate to people quickly. However, I found that people were more distant in Bristol and there's this unspoken protocol where you would just nod or acknowledge another westerner.
I always tried to connect with people from a young age by noticing and acknowledging them. However, after moving to Cardiff, I didn't receive the same response. Most of my connections from the western community were through my husband's family, but when we separated and divorced, I felt I lost my place.
I've been feeling really down lately, especially since I finally found a place in the community. But after my separation, even people I used to socialize with in the past have started to ignore me. I just don't understand what's going on.
I feel that after my husband's passing, some friends who were close to his family have become distant from me. Their loyalty seems to lie with my husband's family now and it makes me feel really isolated at times when I actually need support and connection.
I was quite suspicious, and I didn't know whether that had some impact on things. Because I was suspicious, I nagged a lot, and my husband said it felt like I was going on all the time. Can my nagging be a contributing factor to our issue?
I think my job played a significant role in my current situation. How much do you think my job is responsible for what I am going through?
I have this problem where I'm trying to draw something and it's quite big, almost a quarter of the size it should be. But I'm not very good at drawing.
Lately, I've been struggling with my partner's long absences and unpredictability. It's causing me a lot of stress and I don't know how to handle it.
Since I found it difficult to manage at times, I'm thinking about making it probably the same size as the other one.
I am struggling with uncommunicativeness and feel disconnected from others, and I feel like the issue is of the same magnitude as one of my previous problems.
I used to think that being responsible meant just getting through things on my own, doing what needed to be done and not asking for help. I wanted to be strong and not show any weakness.
I'm feeling really uncertain about my partner not knowing whether he was coming back at a given weekend or not, and when he does return, the earnings I thought he had, which would benefit us, aren't there. Also, there is no explanation for the lack of finances. Additionally, I feel like his family is hostile towards me and I am constantly being scrutinized.
I'm worried that I didn't meet my in-laws' expectations, especially in terms of appearance. They've made comments about my appearance before, mainly because I've always had fluctuating weight issues. I feel like I need to look a certain way to please them.
I struggled to feel like I fit in and often didn't feel comfortable or accepted by people around me, even though some of them weren't necessarily slim or good looking. There were also some negative feelings coming from my family.
Recently, I had a conversation with someone who played a very important role in my life, and I felt that discussing it was crucial for me.
I've been struggling recently, especially after my divorce. My friends Jose and Sam have always been supportive of me, even before the divorce, and they say things that really help. However, they live in Cardiff, and I haven't seen anybody, including them.
I'm considering reaching out to a friend for support, but I'm not sure if I should call or just send a text. I have one friend, Jose, whose number I have and am thinking of contacting.
Lately, I've been thinking about reaching out to an old friend with a text message, maybe something like, 'How are you doing? Get in touch.' I'm not quite sure if they would respond positively, but I think the chances are about 50/50.
I often feel pessimistic about moments in my life, even when I'm surrounded by really nice people.
I'm just not sure of anybody at the moment. I feel uncertain and I don't like being on my own.
I sometimes feel hesitant to share certain things in our sessions. When I don't, it makes me feel bad. I worry that I'm not doing enough to help myself.
I feel like I am making progress, but it's just slow and involves small steps. I think I'll try texting instead of calling since it's easier for me.
I'm trying to work on my anxiety by imagining the worst-case scenario in certain situations. It seems to help me feel more prepared but I'm not sure if it's the right approach. Does it makes things seems worse? I'm also looking for suggestions on things I can do next week to enjoy myself.
I haven't planned anything special, but it's one of my son's birthday next week. I used to love cooking and doing West Indian meals which he enjoys. I'm thinking of doing something special, but I haven't done it for a long time.
I am preparing a meal for my son, and it includes curried mutton, rice and peas, which are actually kidney beans, and a special West Indian seasoned chicken. I think my son might be pleasantly surprised.
I feel like all the people around me are against me. It seems like no one would give me a positive reaction or welcome me in their group.
You know, there will be some people no doubt who are pretty dubious, hesitant to contact you. But there may be some other people who perhaps not as far into that. I think that may be true. But how?
I'm having trouble feeling safe around people and I'm scared of speaking to them. How can I overcome this?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit lost trying to make sense of my thoughts and feelings. While speaking with others, I sometimes struggle to find the right words to express myself.
Recently, I've been feeling like some people are not for me and I've heard them saying unpleasant things about me.
Ever since my husband and I got married, he has had the same job that requires him to be away frequently. When we first met, it didn't seem to be a problem, but after we had our first child, I had this idea in my head that we would be together every night and do things together. It's been really difficult coping with him being away.
I have been feeling lonely lately because I spend most of my time on my own. My partner is often away, and it's becoming hard to predict when he is coming back.
I expect him to come back on certain weekends, but sometimes he doesn't show up without any reason. The whole week, I look forward to him coming back, but it's a constant disappointment. I feel left in the dark and don't know what to say to the children.
I feel upset because my husband has been unpredictable and lacks communication. Lately, he has also been staying away for longer periods than usual. I wonder if there's anything else that has contributed to our relationship going downhill.
I have a list of people I want to call when I'm feeling down. First, I would call my roommate, then my best friend, and finally the guy I'm kind of seeing because he usually brings the guys over.
I have a cell phone on me and I am considering calling my roommates, best friend and boyfriend to tell them that I am not going to a party tonight because I want to do right by my mom and don't want her to be mad.
I've been feeling stressed lately because of my mom. I called my roommate, Nancy, to talk about it.
I have been struggling with my mom's behavior as she won't pay for my school, and she seems really serious and mad about it. I don't think she'll get over it even though my friends say that she might be a little crazy.
I am the patient. I told my counsellor that I don't think I'm going to be partying.
I am having some issues with my mom and she might cut off my money. I just plan on doing what she wants so I can get out of the house after I graduate in mid-May.
I've been having trouble with my mom lately. She's worried that I'm getting into trouble or doing inappropriate things, but I'm really not. I just wish I could convince her otherwise.
I've just been doing a little drinking here and there, not taking drugs from the streets or using cocaine or anything like that. I think I can still party a bit more.
I've been drinking a bit lately, but I don't think it's a problem. My friend, however, thinks it's an issue. I maintain good grades, go to class, and socialize well during parties. In the last two weeks, I've had about five drinking sessions.
I know my mother is concerned about my partying, and it makes me feel bad because I don't want her to worry or feel like I'm making her worry. My friends party more than me, but if someone in the honors program were to comment, they would probably say I'm partying a lot.
I think people might say I party too much and I'm able to maintain my grades in my senior year even though I'm not taking the hardest classes. However, I don't really have any friends who aren't into partying.
Although I'm still getting decent grades like B's, I'm feeling a bit disappointed and worried because I used to get better grades before I started hanging out more.
Sometimes I feel like I want to get back to one grade higher in my studies, but I try not to think about it too much.
Today, I made a deal with my counsellor that I would call some friends and invite them to a coffee shop. I'm nervous about it and unsure how it will go or how long we'll stay there. I agreed to let my counsellor know how it went by leaving a message. Should I call if it goes horribly?
I feel really stressed and overwhelmed with everything I told you earlier, so I've decided not to attend the party tonight. I'm dead serious about this decision.
As a patient, I find it hard to be assertive and say no to things, like when my roommate wants to throw a party. I feel like I need to practice saying no more convincingly.
I do want to make a change. I don't want my mom to call me again and freak out. If she calls and I'm doing the same thing, she's going to say, 'You know you're not doing the spring semester, you'll do it closer to home,' or something.
I'm concerned about graduating because my mother doesn't seem supportive, but I know she's paying the bills. I do want to finish school, but I've been partying too much, and it might be affecting my relationship with her.
I have been going to parties every night, and they're not just short gatherings, but intense parties with a capital 'p'. I tend to party even more on weekends.
I've learned that the fear of doing something is much worse than the thing itself. I think I have a pretty good handle on things now, and I'm making a lot of progress on my dissertation. It's not a problem at all right now. However, I want to make sure that I persist in beating this thing and stay on a roll.
I've actually been in a similar situation before and managed to get out of it by going back to what's worked for me in the past. One method that helped was 'just do it,' like the Nike slogan, and putting my anxiety on the back burner.
I like it to be perfect, but it doesn't have to be perfect. So for now, I think we've taken care of things, but if I need a tune-up in the future, maybe I could come in and I just wanted to say I really appreciate all you've done for me.
I felt bad since I really wasn't working on my dissertation at all, so I did some research. I looked through some articles that I might be able to incorporate into my dissertation. But I'm not sure if looking at the articles is important.
I have been struggling with my dissertation and pushing myself to overcome my self-defeating thoughts. I sought help and I found that just doing it and setting a schedule has worked for me. However, I need some more self-helping thoughts to go along with this approach.
In the past three months, I haven't done any work on my dissertation. Whenever I sit down to work, I feel like it's too hard for me and I don't do it. I want to work on it consistently but I keep putting it off, thinking it's too difficult. I might be a perfectionist.
I think I'm a perfectionist, and everything has to be just so. I have been struggling to work on my dissertation for the past three months. There was one time when I did work on it, but it was nothing significant.
I think the REBT principles make sense to me, and meeting again in about two weeks would be helpful for me to work on what we've discussed and my dissertation.
I managed to make some good progress on all fronts, and most importantly, I'm working on my dissertation.
Lately, I've been putting in effort on a daily basis, and I am proud to say that I'm making progress.
I didn't remember it right away, but now that I'm thinking about this event, I do remember saying that to myself, just kind of in passing. I remember just thinking kind of went off, you'll have time to be worried about this later, let's just work now.
I am working towards overcoming my problem, and my counsellor suggested tracking my progress. I have all kinds of notes on my phone, so when something is happening or going on, I can just whip it out and take note of it.
I feel overwhelmed because half of my life is on my phone and it keeps piling up. What should I do?
I started to let go of the perfectionism with my dissertation a little bit. I realized that even if I work for an hour and find out later that the work wasn't all that great, I still feel better after doing an hour of work than after an hour of procrastinating. Initially, I was afraid that it had to be perfect or it was going to fail, but now I believe that it might not be perfect, but it's still going to be pretty good.
I'm struggling with perfectionism, and although I'm ready to let go of it a little bit, I still have some doubts. However, the most important thing is that I'm working on it daily.
I've been reading the REBT book and have learned a lot about breaking down irrational thought processes. I want things to be perfect, but the book says it doesn't have to be. I feel that I don't have to be overwhelmed by perfectionism anymore and can fight against procrastination.
I started keeping the log, like you suggested, but after two days, I just got into a roll and didn't need to keep the log anymore. I was too busy working, and everything took on a life of its own. The day of our last session, I spent about an hour doing some heavy research and wrote down that I'm tired of procrastinating and just need to do it.
I started to believe that this thing was going to be doable, and I'm not sure if I started believing in it and then began working more, or if I began working and then believed in it. I had a mantra, 'just do it,' and I remember telling you about putting anxiety on the back-burner.
I was always afraid that my work wouldn't be good enough, but I decided to just do it and worry about it later. As things turned out, it was good enough to look back on and I've made a lot of progress on my dissertation.
I'm expecting some support from you as my counselor, just knowing that I have someone I can talk to about my problems and what I'm going through. I also want someone who's not going to go and tell everyone else about my issues.
I've been experiencing some issues that are affecting my sleep and appetite, and I need help in order to have a better living experience. I'm looking for support, but it's crucial for me to maintain my privacy and confidentiality.
I hope that you know that I can all kinda diminish, gets over to next few weeks, I’m hoping. Because I’m getting really, really tired of not being able to sleep.
I've been feeling so down lately and I find myself forcing to look perky and happy, even though I'm not. It's really exhausting, and I'm hoping to see some change within a few weeks.
I'm feeling overwhelmed and I've really had enough of what's going on. I'm near the end of my rope.
I've been struggling with disrupted sleep patterns. I typically go to bed late, wake up early, and my appetite has been affected. I think it's due to my school and work schedule, but now it's become more intense, and I can't sleep at all.
I'm not getting much sleep lately. If I'm lucky, I probably get around two or three hours per night during the week. I tend to toss and turn until the clock turns to around 4 or 5 am.
I feel exhausted during the day, but I have to keep going. I tend to drink a lot of energy drinks to stay awake, even though I know it's not the best way. I don't really have a choice unless I want to risk failing out of school.
It's been really hard for me lately, especially after my recent breakup. Over the past few weeks, I have been only getting one or two hours of sleep.
I've been feeling uncertain about a decision I made recently and keep second-guessing myself. I've been discussing my concerns with my therapist in our sessions.
I think some of the overwhelming experiences started a few weeks before I decided to initiate the break up, and they have intensified since we broke up.
For the past six months, I have been experiencing some symptoms. They particularly intensified three weeks ago, which is when I decided to end a relationship I was in. I'm not sure if there were any other major changes in my life at that time.
I've been spending more time at the clinic lately, working longer hours with my patients. That's the only major change in my schedule recently.
I've noticed that my symptoms have gotten worse lately. At its absolute worst, I end up taking time off when I really shouldn't and just stay at home, watching TV all day long, not eating anything.
Sometimes, when I'm feeling down, I find myself binge-watching TV all day. I do that just for a day, but I wonder what it means and how it affects my mental health.
As a pediatric resident and an attorney, my partner and I both have very busy schedules. It has been hard to connect in ways that are important for both of us. My partner has always been like my best friend.
I used to talk to my friend every day and spend a lot of time together when we had the chance. We both come from different countries, so we had a strong connection dealing with being foreigners in the U.S. Lately, I've been struggling with losing that connection.
I'm struggling with fitting into the U.S. culture and finding it difficult to connect with others. Fortunately, I have my best friend who has a similar background as mine and provides me support and understanding. However, he seems to be one of the few people I know locally who share this experience.
fitting in with, I guess majority culture. it has just been really, really hard. You know especially being in a place where, even though I am in the minority, I am still a minority, within a minority. I’m a person of color and belong to a minority group. But within that minority group, I’m also different because I come from a totally different country, a totally different culture.
I feel frustrated because people assume that I'm automatically accepted, since I'm a minority, but in reality, I'm not.
I recently broke up with my boyfriend of three years and I've been having a really difficult time dealing with that. I'm feeling nervous because I'm not used to being in counseling. I need help to figure out where I can go from here.
I recently went through a breakup with my partner of three years. We were together since we both entered graduate school and have been each other's support system throughout that time. The relationship was very important to me.
I'm in pediatric medicine, and my boyfriend is an attorney. Due to our conflicting schedules, we've barely spent any time together and feel like passing ships in the night. It seems like we're holding on to something that doesn't exist anymore, so I decided that one of us needed to make a change.
I was in a situation where something needed to be done, and it was clear that the other person involved wasn't going to take the initiative, so I decided to be the one to step in and do it.
I'm not from the U.S., I was born in the Caribbean and I identify myself as being a West Indian person. My racial and cultural identity is very important to me. I recently had a breakup which has left a gap in that part of my life.
I feel like my boyfriend was one of the only people who truly understood and accepted me for who I am, not for who people assume me to be. It's really important to me and a big part of my experience right now.
I remember an incident where I was filling out documents and certain categories existed. People have made wrong assumptions about my West Indian identity based on my physical characteristics.
Sometimes when filling out forms, I don't know whether to check a box like Black, Hispanic, or Caucasian, or to check 'Other.' I've even had an argument with someone over it before. I don't want to be difficult, but I'm just not sure how to handle these situations.
I wasn't born in the U.S. and I'm not an African American, but I face confusing situations like people assuming my race on a daily basis.
I recently broke up with my boyfriend who was one of the few people who truly understood my unique perspective and the convergence of my identities. Now that we are not together, I feel like I have to be more private about my experiences. Also, counseling is not really acceptable where I come from.
I'm not used to talking about my problems with non-family members. Lately, I've been feeling isolated because I don't have many friends who understand what I'm going through. I've been withdrawing myself more and having trouble sleeping at night, constantly thinking about the loss of a relationship and the need to establish new friendships.
As a patient, I am struggling with being viewed as a double minority because people judge me based on my physical appearance. I look black or African American, but that is not the ethnic identity that I choose to describe myself by, which has been difficult for others to understand.
I typically have to do a lot of extra explanations to make people understand that I'm not from the U.S., even though I look like I'm African American.
I am finding ways to feel good outside of counseling sessions and hope to gain a new perspective on my life. However, I have some hesitation about attending counseling sessions.
I have to be honest and say that I'm still not 100% comfortable, but I'm willing to try and make an effort to see how the situation works out. I'm open to coming back.
As a patient, I've been feeling overwhelmed and having a hard time expressing my thoughts clearly, so all I can say is... uh... huh...
I don’t know, I think maybe it was I really didn’t want to go and I was really nervous about being there and sharing my experience and the fact that I was brand new to the U.S. I think maybe that’s what it was, just a little bit of anxiety perhaps.
I've been having difficulty sleeping lately and I've been feeling isolated. I also find myself withdrawing from people around me.
Since my breakup, my appetite hasn't been what it usually is. I tend to eat much less than I should.
Lately, I have been feeling really distracted most of the time and I am not able to concentrate at school or during my clinical work. My mind is constantly wandering and it is hard to focus on the task at hand.
I used to be very hurt by the misinterpretation of my actions, like checking a box. It was more painful in the beginning but I've gotten used to it now. However, I had someone who supported me through it, but now I am all alone with no help and support.
I'm attending counseling to receive more support and find out other places where I can get support in my life. But I'm here with some trepidation because my parents would not approve of me sharing my personal situation with a stranger, as it's not a cultural value.
As a patient, I attended counseling one time when I was an undergrad. I had just moved to the US and was having difficulties adjusting. It wasn't a part of my prior experience, but I wanted to try and see what it was about.
I had been to therapy before, but it really didn’t work out well. I think I didn't have a good relationship with the counselors, so I never went back.
I feel hesitant and ashamed to talk about my suicidal thoughts, but I am looking for someone who can ask questions without making assumptions and be open-minded and understanding.
I came to see a professional counselor because I wanted someone who would maintain confidentiality and not spread the things we talk about in session. Trust is a major issue for me, so it is essential that our conversations remain private.
As a patient, I'm concerned about the confidentiality of our sessions. I want to make sure that everything I discuss with you remains private.
As a patient, I feel a bit more comfortable with the situation after the explanation. I think my other goals for therapy and expectations of counseling and you as my counselor are appropriate.
I feel exhausted dealing with my irritation and trying to handle all the issues going on inside me. On top of that, I'm usually the one people go to for solving problems, as I'm the oldest among my siblings. I can't go to them for support because they're already coming to me with their issues.
I don't really know who to go to for help. I guess I should go to my husband, but it's difficult for me.
I often talk about things that are not part of other people's life experiences, and I struggle to make them understand. They think the world is all peaceful, but I've seen this other side.
I don't really have a specific issue to discuss, but I just want to check if you understood what I said earlier.
As a military woman and a black woman, I feel like I always have to perform better than the average person to prove myself. This leads me to suppress my authentic feelings and put up a shield. Now, I'm struggling with all the layers of this emotional armor and finding it exhausting.
I'm struggling with processing my emotions. I feel overwhelmed by the layers of my experience including my military training, combat experience, and having to perform tougher because of my gender and race. It sometimes feels like I'll never heal or be whole again. Can you offer any advice?
I haven't had a chance to really open up about my issues because people around me don't understand and I feel like they look at me crazy. It's hard for me to be vulnerable and share my dark, heavy thoughts.
I'm falling apart. I'm not really… That does not sound good to me at all. I don't want to fall apart.
I've been feeling constantly irritated lately, and even though I have been sleeping, I still feel tired when I wake up.
I just feel like I have no peace and have to hold back all the time. It's like I'm always in a state of constant irritation, even when little things like someone cutting me off while driving trigger me. I don't feel like I can just relax.
I went through some tough experiences as a soldier, and I had to push through it to survive. I didn't really let it affect me, but now, as a woman, I'm realizing that I need to process those experiences and the fear that accompanied them. However, there's no one I can talk to about this.
I am having trouble coping with irritation and it gets worse when I am already feeling overwhelmed. On the other hand, things get better when either the situation goes away or gets resolved in a way that makes me happy.
I have been using a lot of emotional energy to move through the day. My heart is constantly racing, and I recently got mad at someone who threatened my life with a traffic move, which made me scared. It's hard for me to focus as I start thinking about all the other things in life.
Lately, I've been feeling startled most of the time, and I think it's related to my need for control in situations.
I've been feeling this constant irritation, like my last nerve is exposed and there is no peace. I sometimes lose sight of what is going on because I'm so caught up in this feeling and I am not sure when it shows up or what triggers it.
I am constantly experiencing irritation, and my therapist asked me to externalize this emotion, as if it were a separate personality. It feels a little weird and different to view it this way.
I get extremely irritated when something unexpected happens, like someone cutting me off or receiving a last-minute emergency phone call. I don't like surprises at all.
I just got startled, and it's going to take me some time to calm down. The hyper vigilance that happens with my PTSD is like a guard dog that's out of control. The things I normally do to comfort myself, like getting away on my own and reading a book, don't seem to work in certain situations, like when I'm in the car.
I sometimes get overwhelmed with emotions and my body takes a while to settle down. It's difficult for me to stop and notice my feelings in those moments.
I think it would be helpful to have you here to help my partner understand my feelings and emotions better. I often find it difficult to communicate with him and I'm not sure how to approach certain topics.
I think it would be good to have a small group of women to talk about our experiences with combat situations, especially with those who have been in my position. It's unique and I believe it would help me to be able to talk to someone with a similar background.
I feel like it's hard for me to open up to my husband because he has his own problems and I don't want to burden him. I'm more comfortable being the person who provides support rather than receiving it.
I have this automatic startled response and I judge myself for having that reaction. It's really hard to control it and I didn't even realize I was doing it. How can I take care of myself and deal with this?
I have been struggling with judgment and self-criticism, which is preventing me from getting to the care piece. I am trying to learn how to slide this support and understanding over to myself, just as I do for others. Something I could do to relieve my stress would be to find an activity that takes my attention off of it and helps me get in a better place.
I have been struggling with alcohol dependence, and I want to be honest about it without feeling judged. I want to find my strength and be sociable without needing alcohol, just like my late mother. But I'm worried about how to best carry forward her legacy.
I've been struggling with seeing the positive side of my mom's story because of my drinking. Drinking provides me strength momentarily, but it's never been a long-term solution. Now, my girlfriend is worried about my drinking, and I'm starting to feel worried too. I don't want to embarrass myself or my loved ones, and I want to be there for them.
I've been struggling with my drinking habits and it's been affecting my life in various ways. I decided to seek help and come in today.
Since my mom passed away, I have been drinking more to cope with the loss. I'm the oldest of five and have been through a lot with my family, including my mom's mental illness and living in foster homes. I try not to use our difficult past as an excuse, but I'm finding it hard to deal with my mom's death and the unfairness of how she passed. I think it's better to drink and keep up appearances than to cry and feel sorry for myself, but I've been drinking more and don't know if that's a good solution.
I've been drinking since my Navy days, and my girlfriend thinks I'm drinking too much. Maybe my drinking has picked up after my mother passed away, but I don't think it's an issue because it's just socially what we do. However, my girlfriend's worries have made me think, and I do admit I've been drinking more ever since my mother's passing.
I think that I'm, you know, showing everyone that I'm okay, but inside, I know how I'm really feeling. When I drink, I don't have to think about that stuff as much, but it's not working anymore. It's embarrassing when my drinking causes problems, like at someone's wedding. I always feel the need to be in control, and drinking just helps me push down my feelings and avoid dealing with the truth.
I feel like my drinking has increased since my mom passed away, and it's really taking a toll on me. I never really cried or let my emotions out, and I think it's affecting me now. I'm constantly trying to put up a brave face, but I feel weaker compared to what my mom went through without drinking.
I feel like I'm okay when I'm around other people and no one can figure out what I'm feeling. When I drink, I temporarily feel social and great, but when the effect wears off, I feel like a loser. I don't always drink and I feel stronger when I don't run from my feelings or thoughts and do something like going to the gym instead. But I can't keep it going and I always end up thinking about my mom and how things were before she got sick.
I'm worried that coming to therapy might make people think I'm weak or soft. I always thought asking for help like this meant that I wasn't strong.
I've been finding it easier to drink than think, but I don't want to keep putting up a facade like my mother did. I want to find a better way to be strong and brave without relying on alcohol as much. Could we work on that together?
I've come to realize that I've been drinking to cope with my emotions and numb myself from feeling them, but I don't want to keep doing this. I want to change so that I can do better for myself, my girlfriend, my friends, and even honor my mother's strength.
I believe the strength I carry forward is based on a lie. I feel strong, but it doesn't feel like true strength because my mom didn't drink and had a lot of strength, so I can't avoid comparing myself to her.
Hey doc, I was finally able to talk to the school counselor for my loved one. I found out that he is attending class a couple of times a week, which is better than before, but I'm still worried about him.
I'm worried about my son because he's been hanging out with bad influences, though he has been texting me almost every day. He has attended probation meetings and I think he's starting to realize the consequences of his actions, especially after his friend ended up in jail. I've seen him writing a lot at home, but he won't let me look at it.
I am realizing something about my relationship with my son, but I'm not sure if it's a bad thing.
I'm feeling overwhelmed because I have so many bills to pay. My son sold $60 that I was supposed to use to pay the water bill, and I just don't know what to do.
I just can't handle this anymore. My son is just like his father and I'm struggling to deal with everything in my life. I have to deal with financial stress, work pressure, and trying to keep my son on the right path. I feel like I raised him better and I just wish there was a program to send him to and make him into a responsible adult.
I'm struggling because my son recently stole money from me and has been suspended from school. He has also attended programs before, but it doesn't seem to be helping.
I don't know why my loved one is acting like this after going through AA. I'm overwhelmed, and I don't think there's any hope for him. I'm truly struggling to handle this, and it just seems to keep getting worse.
I'm really concerned about my son. He's hanging out with the wrong people and he's smoking pipe. I've raised him better than that, and I didn't have this problem with my daughter.
I feel like I'm wasting my time and should be at work right now. My boss is not happy with what's going on.
I named my son Christian because I love him so much. It's been a long road with him, but I feel like he needs to do his part too.
I feel like I'm hurting him more. I can't help it. We're going to deal with him. I'm going to deal with him. We're going to have a meeting in school and deal with this juvenile justice thing with the pro. We're going to deal with all of these and get this drugs in a row. This is not okay, of course not. Let this piece today, right now, just let it be there, let this piece, where I say, this is my son. What is going on? I can't let this happen and I'm gonna let this guy help me.
As a patient, I just mentioned that I want to make sure we discuss something in our next session and my counsellor praised me for today's session.
I wish he would tell me. I would just I guess ask him to maybe, ah, come home earlier, I mean the texting is all good and stuff and I'm on him constantly about it. Maybe more information on where he's at. I mean, even though he's been lying on the text messages. When we spend more time at home helping out around the house you know, like doing some chores and stuff.
I would like my son to share more about what he's writing, as I heard he has been expressing himself through writing. I want to know more about him, but it's difficult because his walls come up when we're together. What can I do?
Lately, my partner and I have been going through a rough patch, and it's been really hard for both of us. However, recently, I've started to notice some positive changes in my partner's behavior. I just wish I knew what they want from me in order to help us heal and grow together.
I have been trying not to be afraid, but it's not working. In fact, I'm still afraid and my fear has been growing, making my life smaller and more limited.
I get really nervous in social situations, and it feels like my whole life is on the line. When I try to relax, I still fail and can't succeed because my anxiety takes over and I feel like I can't control it.
I have anxiety in this situation, and it's difficult for me to handle. I think I'm not the only one who feels this way, but I don't know how many people are actually going to pass the test.
I'm feeling a lot of emotions right now, but I guess nobody would want to be in the situation I am in. What do you think?
I feel more like there's a clearing, I can see it just a little bit. Earlier, I was feeling confused.
I am feeling a bit better now, like a weight has been lifted, and I am feeling a little bit more hopeful.
Lately, I've been experiencing a lot of stress at work, and it's affecting my personal life. I feel overwhelmed and unable to cope with my daily tasks. How can I better manage my stress and feel more in control of my life?
I've been through this so many times, and someone told me that what I've been doing is not necessarily going to help me, which gives me some hope.
I feel completely wiped out, and I am struggling with something that despite my efforts, doesn't seem to work.
I feel worse and I've learned that it's better just to stay at home and be with the people who I'm more comfortable with.
I've been avoiding challenges at work because they make me feel scared. I try to do what I have to do perfectly, but I don't take on a lot of challenges as it makes me feel really scared.
I feel afraid to take on more challenges at work, even though I know I should. I've tried various things before, but they haven't really paid off. I want to be more proactive, but I don't know how to get there.
I have been trying different ways to control my fear, lack of confidence, feeling of insecurity, and thoughts of failure. I have even read books, argued with myself, tried to persuade my way out of it, and pushed my way through it. Despite all this, my fear remains and I have been in therapy for it.
I've been to so many therapists, and now I find myself in front of yet another one. I feel like I'm not making progress, and it's frustrating.
I feel incompetent and shy. I don't feel I can do the things that other people can do, and I'm not confident.
I feel a little bit like a failure and disappointed in myself. It hurts, and as I say it, it's heavy.
I have been struggling with personal and relationship issues, so I've tried going to therapy before and also read a lot of self-help books to understand how to become effective and have better relationships with people. The books make sense, but I still can't seem to overcome my issues.
I understand the techniques, but they never seem to quite work for me. I have two close friends from a long time ago, and I've tried going out with them to be more sociable, but it hasn't really worked out.
I tried to see if I can handle talking to people, but it just doesn't work out. In those situations, I only end up feeling more of what I started with.
I've been trying so hard to do better, but it feels like I'm stuck in a hole of fear, lack of confidence, and thoughts of failure. I've been trying to find a way out, but it doesn't seem like there is one, and I feel like I'm carrying a shovel that's not helping at all.
I feel like I'm in a hole that's constantly getting bigger no matter how much I try to dig myself out, using different methods and approaches.
I've been struggling a long time with my issues and I need to know the rules to go out there. My mind keeps telling me that I have to dig differently, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.
I've tried so many sensible things to improve my situation, but it doesn't feel like anything has worked. I've put in a lot of effort, yet I'm still struggling. Is there something odd about that?
I feel like this is just another failure in my life. The more I work on this issue, the worse it gets. Why would it be like this?
I'm constantly thinking about a certain issue, it feels like it occupies about 80% of my day.
I've been trying really hard to figure out what's wrong with me and how to solve my problems. I have done sensible, logical, and reasonable things, but I still end up in this chair in front of a therapist. What should I do?
I feel like my wheels are spinning and I'm stuck in my situation.
I feel like I'm being one-upped and I'm a bit confused about the whole conversation. I do feel some hope when you said there's no way out, but I can't help thinking that you have an agenda. Can you explain?
I've been seeking comfort in my life, but it seems like the things I do to find comfort are actually making me feel less comfortable and strong.
I find it difficult for my mind to understand and find strength in certain situations. The counselor provided an example asking me to remember the numbers one, two, and three.
I was given a set of numbers, one, two, three, to memorize with the promise of getting a million dollars. Now, I know that it was a lie, but I still remember the numbers.
I feel like I'm sinking in quicksand with my fear. I don't know what to do, and it feels like everything I try just makes me sink deeper. How can I handle this situation?
Sometimes when I go swimming, I stress about swimming the perfect stroke and it interferes with my performance.
I feel like my heart's going to start beating really fast and I may start shaking. That's what usually happens.
As a patient, I feel a little bit of hope, but I still have some questions and doubts about my situation.
Lately, I have been trying this new way of going out in the field and wandering around rather than digging, to find a different solution to my problems. However, it's not really a new thought for me, but it feels that way.
I've been constantly trying to figure out my problems, but I still feel stuck.
Lately, I've been observing that my thoughts seem to take a negative turn, and it's making me feel down. I find it interesting that this is what comes out of my mind.
I often find myself trying to communicate with others, but then I stop before saying anything. I just feel a little weird and unsure about how to express myself.
I do sometimes show affection to my family, but not really to people outside. I tried expressing affection openly once, but it felt corny, and when I didn't get the same response back, I decided not to do it again.
I feel so, I just (inaudible) about the hood over my head and it didn't matter, you know, I mean, you see, he is kinda giving people a message. That you don't really matter that much to me. You don't really matter that much to me?
I don't really feel emotions sometimes and I think it might be because I've developed a strong 'I-don't-give-a-***' muscle from not letting people get to me. I've always kind of been this way.
I have this issue where I have a strong 'I-don't-give-a-***' muscle, but my 'I-care-about-you' muscle is very weak. I rarely initiate conversations where I express my love or care for someone. Does this cause problems in my relationships?
I'm having a hard time accepting compliments, and I tend to downplay any positive moments during our sessions. I enjoyed our conversation today, but I don't think it was anything special.
I felt quite special and enjoyed talking in a video. It was a once in a lifetime experience for me and I felt like my problem was interesting. I'm not sure if I was chosen for the video for that reason.
I've been struggling with feeling unworthy of compliments because I'm not perfect. I'd like to try and improve my self-esteem but it feels like mission impossible.
I feel like such a failure because of the issues with my friend Lizzie, but when I think about my job, I have been working there for two years and I don't feel like a complete failure there.
I sometimes worry that I'm a total failure, but I know deep down that I'm not.
I feel like I can't go on like this. I'm struggling with the idea that I'm a total failure, worthless, and a nobody. But, honestly, I don't think that's the complete truth about myself.
this week, there was one time with Lizzie, where she accused me of opening her mail and invading her privacy. I started to get anxious, tense, and couldn't breathe.
I started to become aware of my breathing and forced myself to take deep breaths when I felt overwhelmed.
After my mother passed away, my dad started yelling at me instead of her. I became a barrier for my siblings by taking in all his anger and negativity, so he left them alone. I continued to take care of the kids and keep myself busy.
I had a situation when I was called stubborn by someone, but my mom took me aside and told me not to listen to them, and that I am tenacious. She was a wonderful person and protective towards me, and I really miss her.
I'm experiencing panic attacks, and I noticed that they started around my daughter's 13th birthday. I recently realized that might be tied to when my mom died when I was 13. I never really grieved the loss of my mom, and these panic attacks might be related to that.
I always have these thoughts that I can never do anything right and I'm unappreciated. For example, I went to call my sister for dinner and she just yelled at me, which felt really unfair.
I always feel like I can't do anything right. I'm always wrong and I'm just a total failure.
I've had to raise my brother and sister, and even though my father told me I was too stupid to go to school, I went anyway and paid my own way by working through it.
I had to take care of my father and two kids while in high school. My father was drinking, depressed, and mean. He told me that I wasn't smart enough to go to school. I wanted to study interior design, but I pursued it anyway. Now, my child is about to go to college, which is a good thing.
Recently, I've been noticing some changes in my life. For instance, I feel that my kids are doing okay.
I feel completely worthless and hopeless as my daughter Lizzie is entering her early adolescent stage where everything I do is wrong. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her. My whole life feels like a big glob of misery, a total personal tragedy. When I was my daughter's age, my mother died of cancer and I felt like my whole life was over.
I have been experiencing anxiety and panic episodes recently. I often think about my past when I was 13 and had to take care of my father, who was very depressed and alcoholic, as well as my younger siblings. I wonder how this would affect my daughter.
During my childhood, I had to take care of my siblings and father after my mom's absence. I had to prepare breakfast, wake up my father, get ready for work, and make lunches for everyone. Sometimes, I even had to go and check on the kids during my lunch hour. In my family, we never really dealt with our feelings, we just stuffed them down. My dad was drinking and feeling depressed because he missed my mom, and he ended up taking it out on me.
Recently, I found a picture of my mom and it got me thinking about her. I was in deep thought when my daughter, Lizzie, saw me and asked what was going on. I explained to her about her grandmother and my mother, and to my surprise, she was really interested. We spent the entire evening talking about my mother, and it felt good to share something of my life with her.
I remember when I first came in, I was a 'glob of misery' and experienced panic attacks and depression. I've noticed that I've changed from that time, and I can see differences in the person I was then and the person I am now.
I have been attending therapy sessions, and one of the things I've learned is to notice when an attack is coming on. I can now change what I'm thinking or the voice in my head, which helps me gain control of the situation. Also, I've learned to communicate my feelings to others rather than suppressing them.
I have been experiencing some emotional attacks, and I often find myself stuffing my feelings instead of expressing them. Can you help me figure out how to deal with these emotions better?
After everyone left the house, I had a crying episode followed by getting ready for work and getting into my car.
I was getting ready for work, but as soon as I got into the car, I suddenly felt faint. I got scared, and I started to breathe heavily, my heart racing. I thought I was having a heart attack and would have to go to the emergency room. I felt like I was suffocating and needed help, so I tried getting out of the car to find someone to help me. I felt like everything was closing in on me.
I had a lot of responsibilities and was taking care of things, but my partner would belittle me and make jokes about my intelligence, like I was too stupid to go to college. When I got upset, he would say it was just a joke and I couldn't get mad. This made me feel awful and I just pushed those feelings down.
When Patrick, who often has an edge of criticism, says critical things to me, it makes me feel really angry. But I'm usually told that it's just a joke, so I just stuff these angry feelings down and don't deal with them.
I have been experiencing panic attacks and it's causing me a lot of distress. I've even had to go to the emergency room on a couple of different occasions.
Well, I took it all in and the boss went back into the room and I started to get very upset. I thought about using what we talked about last week, so I went into the boss' room and told him that when something like this happens, and he yells at me, it makes me feel very bad and it's not any kind of way to work because this wasn't my fault. Everything I did about getting the tapestry there was right. It wasn't my fault and he really had no right to yell at me about that. I don't think it's a good way to work. After I told him, he had calmed down a little and I think he understood.
I felt kind of proud that I had taken a situation into my hands and acted upon it. I noticed when I was starting to simmer, take it in, and stuff it down.
Recently, I've noticed that I can identify difficult situations before they begin, and I consciously make an effort to confront the person involved.
As a patient, I struggle with my internal voice that often bothers me. But lately, I've found a way to change that voice and make it play something different, a different thing to say using my own voice.
I said that to him and I stormed out of the room and I got into the back into the kitchen. I waited to see if there was a reaction and there wasn't. I guess I kind of thought it was funny. But I certainly felt the tension go. And I felt like yelling at everyone. What else could I have done, Dr. Meichenbaum? What else, what would a normal person do?
I'm tired of my partner ignoring me all the time. I tried to express my feelings, but when they respond by putting all the blame on me, it just makes me feel guilty.
This week was pretty normal, but there was an incident at work where I tried to use the skills we talked about. I had ordered a tapestry to be delivered to a client for a showing, but it didn't arrive on time even though I gave clear directions. The clients got very angry.
I was in a situation at work where someone made a mistake, got mad, yelled at the boss, and then the boss came and yelled at me.
I've been experiencing this vicious cycle related to my breathing, and I think it's affecting my overall well-being. I am willing to learn some relaxation techniques to help me control my breathing better.
Lately, I've been struggling with panic attacks and tenseness. I remember a specific situation with my friend Lizzie where I experienced these feelings and thoughts. Can we discuss that and understand it better?
I had just entered the room, and she started yelling at me about invading her privacy all the time, which I found completely unfair because I didn't do anything.
I walked out of the room after an argument and I couldn't help but feel like I can never do anything right for anyone in my family. I always feel wrong, not good enough, and completely worthless.
I started going to work recently, and I've been feeling increased tension between my partner and me. I think maybe it's because I'm gaining some independence and my partner might resent that. He hasn't directly said anything about my work, but he tends to belittle me.
I recently started working, but my partner keeps belittling my job. He refers to it as my 'little job,' and it makes me so mad. I feel like he thinks he has the big job, and I have the little job.
For the past 18 years, Patrick has been a significant person in my life and has constantly belittled me. Also, my father used to treat me similarly.
I have been belittled, criticized, and treated sarcastically and coldly by someone. They even told me that I couldn't go to school or continue with my life.
I wasn't smart enough to go on to school and it's been better this week because I haven't had any panic attacks. But I don't know why I feel kind of worse, actually. I'm more depressed and I've been thinking about a lot of things, which makes me feel terrible.
I heard that a couple of times and I thought, I have to change this, so I just said to myself, I said, 'This isn't my fault. I didn't do this.' And it seemed to kind of relax me in a way.
Recently, I have been able to notice when I am getting worked up, and this time I managed to catch myself and interrupt it. I told myself that it wasn't my fault and that I didn't do anything wrong.
I recently have been repeating something to myself to cope with my emotions. When I do this, the issue seems to kind of go away, and the physical distress doesn't happen. It just stops.
Lately, my relationship with Patrick hasn't been too good. It seems like things started getting difficult between us since I started working a couple of years ago.
I guess that's when the tension started to come in when I went to work.
Last week, I walked into my friend Lizzie's room at 5:00 pm to tell her it was time for dinner, and she started screaming at me. This situation made me feel anxious, tense, and caused hot and cold flashes, hyperventilation, and thoughts like 'Oh my God, not again'.
When I walked into her room, I was feeling that this is not my fault and it's unfair. I felt like I just can't do anything right, ever, in this family. After that, I walked out of the room and could feel these feelings coming on, like a vise closing in on my chest.
I felt tense in my whole body, and I had a racing heart and difficulty breathing, which made me feel like I was suffocating. I ended up walking out of the room to cope.
I had been feeling anxious and depressed due to the loss of my mom. Recently, I had a surprising encounter with Patrick, my husband. He was acting very busy and important, and brushed me off when I tried to talk to him. I got angry and waited until he got off the phone to confront him by calling him a bad name.
I had an interesting experience with my partner the other day. We had an argument, and I ended up calling him a bad name. To my surprise, the rest of the day went really well, and we even had a nice time when we went out that night. It's strange because I wouldn't expect such an outcome from both of us, especially after that incident.
I could take 'em all in and turn them against myself, but in this case, I just, I guess I turned them against him. Well this time it came out. Patrick, you are such an [bad name]. I couldn't believe I said that.
When I said 'no,' I was angry and began to feel anxious. After that, I stormed out of the room.
I've been on Ritalin before, and I don't really understand why they don't prescribe better drugs. I've tried some substances, but I don't know what's best for me. Have you ever tried using any cool drugs?
I've been feeling a lot of pressure to try drugs, specifically boomers, because people around me say it opens up a whole new world and helps with creativity. I'm worried that if I don't try it, I won't be able to connect with others, but I also don't want to change the way I treat people just to get access to these drugs.
I'm struggling with my relationship with my mom. She tends to worry about me and is always threatening to put me in the hospital. I don't feel like she listens to me and I need help communicating with her.
As a patient, I feel like rap music represents the truth, and when I listen to it, everything else seems insignificant. I came up with a metaphor that it feels like train tracks following me with a train on it, and I think that's a truthful representation of my feelings.
I've been feeling kind of lifeless lately, like I'm just three-quarters dead. But when I rap, my eyes sparkle and I feel alive again.
Lately, I feel like my mind is a runaway train, going nonstop and not telling other people what to do. But I am just concerned about the world, and sometimes it feels overwhelming.
I've enjoyed being with you during this counseling session, and when I'm talking to people like a counselor and it feels okay, I believe it's good counseling. But sometimes I struggle to figure out what to say.
I've seen a lot of psychiatrists in my day, and I can even create rap about it. What do you think about the idea of creating a psychiatric rap?
I used to be annoyed with people who just smoked and stared at me, but now they have to say something, so it's better. I also wrote a rap about my experiences at a hospital.
I have these thoughts that just come to me, and I don't know what to do with them.
I'm feeling upset because a girl I liked dumped me. My friend told me that the guy she's now with is a little older than me and bought her expensive gifts.
I feel so discouraged when people don't understand me, and I don't know how to talk to adults easily. I doubt that an older person like you could understand someone like me.
I've been receiving advice from various adults about dealing with kids, and many of them are suggesting that I should give them drugs as a solution to their problems. I personally think that drugs could be the cause of their issues.
My mom told me that she's going to put me in the hospital if I don't talk to someone, so I came to see the counsellor.
I was at a meeting with a counselor who hadn't read my history but wanted to get to know me. I shared that I didn't know what to do and my mom was thinking about putting me back in the hospital. I then mentioned how she has this idea of who she wants me to be, but I'm really into rap music and even the freestyle rap champion of the county.
I need to smoke some weed because it helps me loosen up and say what I need to say, but my mom gets all freaked out about that and thinks it's like heroin or crack. I tried to be open with her about it, but she just ended up flushing it down the toilet.
I told my friend to try it, man, thinking it would take the edge off. I doubt she'll do it though.
As a patient, I recently tried alcohol and ended up puking my brains out. I also take medication from the hospital. I'm worried about the effect of mixing alcohol, medication, and marijuana on my brain.
I was told that the medication I was on was really strong and I couldn't even do any rap, which I normally enjoy doing.
I was in the hospital and there was a radio station having a freestyle rap contest. The winner would get a chance to go to LA and potentially get a recording contract. I was really excited about it, but the hospital wouldn't let me go out on a pass to participate.
I told my friends about my plans to visit the hospital, and they suggested I should have lied about it because they believe that hospital staff doesn't like rap. What should I do?
I have been experiencing hallucinations and illusions, and I believe others have been discussing it with you as well.
I feel bored and sleepy during school because there's a lack of interaction between the teachers and students. The teachers just talk, talk, and talk, and there's no engagement or connection with the students.
I just went through school and did what I was supposed to do. It wasn't that hard. But now, I am very unhappy and I don't understand the point of it all.
I don't know, man. Some of the best rap songs are about going to jail. It's kind of like... I just want to have it on my resume, man. I just wanna... So, what are you supposed to do for me?
I am unhappy and feel like there's no life in me. My girlfriend recently dumped me because she likes another guy and I don't know how to deal with this.
I feel like my recent ex-girlfriend left me for another guy because he had a job and I didn't. It's making me feel inferior and upset.
I'm a bit skeptical about talking to you, but I'm willing to give it a try. What should I talk about for this counseling process to help me become smarter, and maybe even improve my relationship with my mother?
I struggle to communicate with my stepdad. He doesn't allow anyone to talk, especially when I'm angry. It's like he's a runaway train, and it's impossible to get a word in.
I've been feeling like there's this train that follows me around and lays down tracks right in front of me.
I'd like to go score an ounce, get together with my hommies, get high, and sit out on the street doing music and rapping. If I could do that, I would be fine, and I know someone would discover me because it's good stuff. I became the county champion in a rap contest, and I have rap tunes running through my head all the time.
I was in class when suddenly I heard my name, Rodney. My teacher called on me and started talking about some historical event in 1942 related to World War 2. I felt a bit overwhelmed.
I feel embarrassed in class when kids laugh at me, and my teacher says I have a 'chicken look,' like I'm thinking about something else. I struggle to find the importance of what we're learning because it feels irrelevant.
Recently, I've been feeling a bit disappointed when my husband and I don't meet each other's expectations, even though we generally support and encourage each other.
My husband expects me to stay at home during the week while he's at work. He works long hours, and sometimes he comes home extremely tired and wants to take a nap. I immediately think he's lazy.
I feel a bit frustrated because my partner has an unstructured routine, especially during evenings. On weekends, we do fun things together, but I wish he could have a more consistent schedule throughout the week, like going to bed at a descent hour and waking up early for work.
I'm feeling frustrated and overwhelmed because I'm caught between two opposite sides of me. I don't know where I stand, what I am supposed to do, and what role I'm supposed to play.
I feel really frustrated. There's no happy medium, and I constantly feel like I'm letting go of myself and not being a person at all.
Lately, I've been using light to manage my emotions because it brings in the blue that touches the red where frustration is normal. I'm trying to find a balance where I can have peace without giving up all of my emotions. What do you think?
I'm struggling right now because I feel torn in my situation.
While making an art piece, I tried to explore myself, but I'm not sure if it's right or wrong.
I'm finding it hard to express myself lately, and I use the color red in my art as a way to vent my frustrations. The white strokes don't seem to hold any significance though.
I’ve realized that there's a distinct dividing line in my emotions. The blue represents the calm, relaxed, and peaceful state that I want to achieve. But currently, I'm struggling with frustration and lack of peace within myself and my surroundings.
I recently used light blue or lavender chalk which I felt was soft, but sometimes it smears together, and I'm not really sure how to feel about it.
I feel like I am rational, orderly, strong, and stubborn. I believe there's order in things.
I have a tendency to feel outrage at times, but I'm unable to express my frustration properly.
I sometimes feel unable to express my emotions in a mature way. It's like my outrage comes out just like a child.
I need to vent. I do that better if I get out of the house.
I get really angry sometimes, especially when I stay in the house. I've noticed that things tend to build up, and then a trivial trigger sets me off.
Lately, I've been feeling like my emotions have been building up, and then suddenly, they just explode.
I feel like there's a certain amount of freedom others have, and I came across a quote that says, 'Time is a caterpillar.' It stuck with me and made me think about how I'm spending my time.
I feel like I'm constantly investing in my child and my husband, and there has to be some time for me to still have a little bit of myself. But one day, I'll have a lot of time for myself.
I'm not sure what I want to do, but I know it's important for me to maintain my individuality. I have others telling me it's important too.
I feel conflicted because sometimes my husband wants me to stay at home, but then when bills come in, he mentions how nice it would be if we had two incomes so we could take a nice vacation. I have to remind myself that this was a decision we made together.
I've been feeling stressed and worried about things going on in my life. I think I worry about what everyone else worries about, like where I'm going to be in five years and if what I'm doing now is the right thing. It's just normal everyday life.
I often think about how others cope with their everyday life compared to me. I wonder if I handle things the same way as everyone else or if I'm different.
I am really puzzled about how some people can come across looking like they have it all together and they have all the answers, while I'm always the first one to be confused.
I admit I don't have all the answers and I'm going to make mistakes. But I don't like to look so unsure of myself when other people are so confident. They go through the same things I do, but they have that attitude that says they have it all together.
Lately I've been feeling overwhelmed and like I don't have it all together.
I feel pretty good when I say that I know I am somebody, but not at all times. It's good while I'm saying it.
As the patient, lately, I've been feeling frustrated and I catch myself saying things out of frustration. I have to constantly remind myself that it's not enough.
I noticed that when I compare the two, one of them is more subdued and has a more circular shape. What are your thoughts on both of them?
As I look at it, I feel more complete. Here, it's a definite, I'm broken, but where this blends it together, it's more of a circle.
I feel like there's a definite break in me and it shows a line of frustration.
I've been feeling like I'm always on high alert for something, trying to listen and learn all the time. I think I constantly have my antennas up, and it's affecting me right now.
I feel like the more information I take in, even if I don't use it immediately, I don't forget it. It stays with me and comes to mind later when I need it. I'm currently studying and trying to absorb as much as I can.
I noticed that the color pink has been affecting my mood lately. It seems to tone down my emotions, but it might also be contributing to my frustration.
I haven't lost that, but it's not my biggest area. It's still part of me, and then you have the blue keeping your feet rest and calm and combining the two.
I wish I could be more like the color purple, which represents royalty and confidence. I want to be more sure of myself and become more independent.
I just started my session with my counsellor, Dr. Natalie Rogers. She suggested we start by spending a minute in silence, closing our eyes, and focusing on our thoughts, feelings, and sensations. I agreed and participated in the exercise.
I am struggling to clear my mind and sometimes, it takes a while just to get away from everything.
As a patient, I feel that taking a break helps me clear my mind and release tension and stress.
Sometimes, when I close my eyes and relax for a few minutes, I have different kinds of things going on in my head. When I close my eyes all the way, I try not to worry about things.
I don't like who I've become, and I'm often unhappy. There has to be a happy medium.
I feel like I'm not giving up any aspect of myself, but rather integrating different parts of my personality and softening them. I want to be more available and receptive to information, like a butterfly.
I've noticed that caterpillars go through a lot of work before they become a butterfly, and I find that really interesting. I've also had to go through a lot of changes and adjustments in my life, like giving up my career.
I have been going through a lot of changes and adjustments in my life. It has been difficult, but I believe it's making me a better person in the end. I feel like my situation is similar to a caterpillar going through stages of transition.
As a patient, I want to share with you that I'm constantly thinking about the beauty and potential of a bird that has the amazing ability to fly freely.
I often find myself worrying about things, but most of the time, it's something trivial and I just forget it. I feel the same way the next day and then we move on.
As a patient, I sometimes experience frustrated feelings that get really accumulative and it acts like a filter system. The important emotions stay and the ones that aren't important get spread out.
I've been trying to choose my battles wisely. You know, if it's something I feel strongly about, I'll get in there and fight for it. But if it's not that important, I don't see the point of getting into a battle.
As the patient, I'm trying to adapt to a different perspective and I hope that these changes will be more subdued.
I personally like bright colors, especially red. But sometimes, red just stands out too much and it seems a bit troublesome to me.
Lately, I've been struggling to recognize the value of being a stay-at-home mom. I feel that it's due to the stereotypes and societal expectations surrounding the role, and I don't always feel accomplished or validated in my position.
I've been struggling to recognize that what I'm doing is important on a daily basis, and it's not easy for me. However, I realized that when my child is 18 years old and appreciates the efforts I put in raising them, I feel fulfilled.
I feel that when I look at myself on a daily basis, things seem bad, but when I think about the long term, it actually seems nicer.
I need to keep my feet on the ground, and the green color represents my need for more individuality and showing more of myself. It's a peaceful color, almost like the blue.
I feel peaceful as it makes me more distinct from other people, but I am not sure about something.
I feel like, the more I learn, the more I realize I have much more to learn. I don't think I'll ever have all the answers and know everything, but I do believe I have the potential to be anything that I choose to be.
I feel like a caterpillar that has the potential to become something beautiful, like a butterfly. But, I am constantly working hard and struggling in my life.
I made these purple wings because purple represents royalty for me. And I made them big as they symbolize my freedom and how they will help me fly and achieve my dreams.
I feel like I can soar to different places with my own individuality, regardless of what anyone else thinks. This attitude allows me to be who I am, and it gives me a sense of freedom and strength, almost like I have big, purple wings.
Lately, I've been feeling like royalty because I believe I'm important, even if nobody else thinks so. I just need to recognize this importance myself.
I feel like there are two different aspects of my life, and the only way I can see to move from one to the other is through processing the information I receive and using it to create something new. I believe this process can help me find a balance and merge the different parts of my life.
I have to use my own abilities, my own insight, and things that I take in and be able to process the information and put things in perspective. I know that there is the possibility of being happy in between here, if I keep looking ahead instead of looking on a daily basis.
In a given weekend, if my husband says something that drives me completely off and gets me frustrated. I concentrate on what he thinks of me and what he wants from me, and we're not seeing eye to eye. I'm not looking at the big picture, just focusing on isolated incidents, and I have a tendency to look too much at those. That's why in our marriage alone, I sometimes sleep on something.
I made an important decision, but I still feel like I have other things to think about besides what the other person wants. I try to remind myself that I'm a person too and if I don't hold onto that, I might lose myself.
I appreciate the time spent with you during our session today. I tried experimenting with colors, as you suggested, to express my feelings. I'm considering trying this activity with my kids as well, as it could be a way for us to freely express our emotions without worrying about creating profound artwork.
Lately, I have been feeling quite unsure about my decisions. I'm considering a new venture, but I'm not confident if it's worth the risk.
I started to just start it with a butterfly but then it became nonsense, so I skipped that.
I've been feeling like I had antennas, like a butterfly, that I would use to interpret things around me.
I feel like my thyroid receives my signals, like I'm a butterfly that's always free with the blue in, keeping my feet on the ground.
I find the image of a butterfly appealing because they are colorful, and they go through a process of transformation from a caterpillar to a butterfly. I feel like I am somewhere in the cocoon stage, eventually going to break free soon.
Lately, I've been feeling like I'm in a cocoon stage of my life, like there's a potential for me to really become something more, like a butterfly. Does that make sense to you?
I'm struggling with letting go of my expectations because I feel like I lose myself in the process. I know there must be a balance, but I don't know how to find that happy medium.
I'm feeling frustrated because I'm unsure of who I am without my expectations, and I'm wondering at what point should I give in to help the relationship.
I'm struggling with setting boundaries in my relationships, not just with my spouse, but with friends as well. I'm unsure when to stop giving without losing myself, but I worry that if I keep giving, I'll change myself into something else.
I have been struggling with the question 'Who am I?' and I don't feel like I want to be someone else.
I feel like I have a bug in my system that's affecting my daily routine.
I like to have things organized, you know. I keep a calendar, so I know what's happening during the month and what's to look forward to. I take a very structured role, while my partner is very passive and laid back.
I've realized that I need to somehow work to be more like my friend because if I keep trying to make him be like me, it would be too stressful for me. But, changing my mindset is really difficult.
Lately, I've been feeling very frustrated. I want to be more free-spirited and let go of my strict schedules, so that I can be more like my carefree friend. I feel like this is the only way for me to get rid of my frustration.
As the patient, my worry is that if I drop my expectations about my plans, I feel like I'm losing my individuality.
I feel good when someone opens up to me and trusts me. It gives me a sense of accomplishment.
I'm noticing some positive changes in my marriage recently. My husband has been opening up more and communicating better. Five years ago, I wouldn't have believed that he could talk to me like this, but it's been a gradual process, and I'm quite happy with the progress we've made.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with handling various aspects of my life, but I'm happy to say that my partner has opened up a lot more and we are experiencing some positive changes in our relationship.
Lately, there have been a lot of positive things going on in my life, but there's always some bad too. The one thing that troubles me currently is...
I'm struggling to find my role in life. I've talked about it several times, but I still haven't got an answer. I know that I'm a wife, but I feel like there's more to me.
I feel like there's a dramatic split in how I view certain situations, and I would like to find a way to mix these conflicting perspectives.
I've been struggling because I feel like people can't have it either or, and we have to be somewhat flexible.
I have to be flexible. In other words, I can have my cake and eat it too. (laughs)
I'm trying to have some peace without losing my individuality and acknowledging my frustration in various roles. I find it challenging to imagine myself the way I want to be, especially when doing an exercise with my non-dominant hand.
As the patient, I was initially discussing a potential solution or activity to deal with a problem, but I hesitated and expressed some doubt. I mentioned that I wanted to do something but found myself unsure and stumbled in my words.
I have to do chores after finishing my homework, unlike other kids I know who can just go outside and play. I find it difficult and annoying, but I believe it will help me grow up to be a good man.
I want to be more honest, but it's going to be tough. I need to encourage myself every day. I plan to remind myself by keeping it in my head and maybe writing it down a few times. I have a mirror in my bedroom where I could put the reminder.
I'm not sure whether to write some information on a piece of paper or use a card. I'm also curious about the best place to write that information. I eventually asked for a card, and they offered me a small business card, but I'm still not quite sure if that's the most appropriate choice.
I've been struggling with being honest with my parents, and I'm trying to think of ways to improve that. One example is from basketball: the ball's far away, and I want it. To get there, I need to practice in my mind, set little goals, run, get the ball, pass it, and shoot, hoping to make it.
I've been struggling lately, but I'm trying to make it through this tough time. I respect my parents and their advice on self-encouragement and honesty. I believe they can help me.
I am trying to stand up and be honest with myself, but sometimes I struggle with it. For instance, while dribbling the ball and making the hoop, it occasionally slips out of my hands. I am open to receiving a follow-up letter to see how I'm doing on this journey.
I was talking to someone, and they offered to get my address when we finish our conversation. They asked if I have an email, but I told them that only my mom and dad have one.
I'm not sure how this ball exercise relates to the concept of honesty. Can you help me understand the connection?
I was playing a two-on-two basketball match with some people. One of the guys had scary eyes and reminded me of a Halloween character. During the game, I managed to get the ball after it was dropped, and I thought about the saying 'what goes around, comes around'.
I explained to my counsellor about how I would strategize in a basketball game to pass the ball and make shots. I connected it with the concept of honesty, saying that if I am honest to my teammates, someone else would be honest to me, and it spreads in the same manner.
I am trying to change by resisting the urge to lie and doing my best to tell the truth because I've realized that when I tell the truth, it comes back to me like a bouncing basketball. However, I understand that this process is going to be hard work.
I recently received the honesty award at school, something I never expected. My teacher had previously written on the back of my assignment chart that I was very honest. After receiving the award, I realized that honesty is an important aspect of respect, which is something my mom always told me, but I didn't quite understand until now.
I believe my parents respect me. An example would be when there is a song I like and I know all the words to it, they allow me to sing along. One of the songs that I enjoy singing is *NSYNC's 'It's Gonna Be Me'.
I find it interesting that when a certain song is playing and I know all the words, my parents will be quiet while I sing. Is that a sign that they respect me?
I find it difficult when I'm having a conversation with others because they've taught me not to talk unless I know the other person is done. So, when I'm the first one talking, I keep talking and they don't interrupt.
I managed to encourage myself to do something that I was hesitant about. A lot of people would usually say no to such situations.
I've been struggling with something that I think is affecting my overall wellbeing, and I'm willing to work on it. My main concern is how to make positive changes in my life.
I feel like I need to catch up with someone on a certain topic and I want to ask them a bunch of questions. I'm also open to them asking me questions. My main focus is to understand how things will look like when the situation starts improving and getting better.
I've been getting my parents mad. I mean, I haven't really made them happy since Florida last year. I guess it's just the way my attitude's changed ever since the baby's came.
I once participated in a talent show back in third grade. I wanted to be a singer, so I practiced and sang in the talent show. However, I didn't make it, but it helped me find the courage to do other challenging things, like talking to you right now.
I've been trying to encourage myself in difficult situations. My Dad taught me to say 'I can do it' instead of thinking that I can't. It's something that I've adopted and has stuck with me.
I have always wanted to be a singer and I still have that dream. I usually sing at home and in the shower, but I haven't performed yet. I like to sing songs by Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, and 98 Degrees. I want to become popular in the future.
I enjoy singing songs by Garth Brooks, *NSYNC, and the Backstreet Boys. When I sing their songs, I try to sing what they sing, like I know all the lyrics to 'It's Gonna Be Me.' But I feel a bit hesitant to sing in front of others.
Lately, I have been feeling like I am always on edge and constantly worrying about everything. Even little things trigger a lot of anxiety in me, like when there's a minor change in my routine or something small goes wrong. It's becoming really difficult for me to manage these emotions.
I want to change something in my life and it is very important to me. I would rate it a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. It's a really big deal for me to make this change.
I feel like my current situation is black and I'm used to it. I want to improve my relationship with my parents and move towards a better place, but I'm not sure how to start.
I'd be respecting others. That's my main problem. Honesty and respect are important, and sometimes, I lie, so there's a lack of honesty.
I get mad when I don't get my way, and it makes me look like a spoiled brat. My family is easy on me but they still tell me to do stuff, like getting my sum chart signed to get my money. I don't think I'm a spoiled brat but I act like one.
I get mad and talk back to my parents when they ask me to do something. For example, I'll question why I have to do it and sometimes get into arguments with them, like yesterday when we disagreed about the roles of parents and children.
I recently received some valuable advice from my parents. My dad suggested a great way to encourage myself, and my mom emphasized the importance of honesty. I have followed and believed in both of these pieces of advice.
I often find myself not listening to my parents and doing the opposite of what they say. I believe that without honesty, there's no respect.
Sometimes, I need to encourage myself to be a singer, like following my dad's advice. I sing in the car when I know the song that's playing. I trust my parents because I know they'd never lie to me.
Last year, I received the honesty award in my school. I am not sure how I got that or who the judge was for that award.
I've tried writing a reminder for myself in cursive to be more honest, but I'm finding it difficult to fit everything on just one card. I need it to be in multiple places, like my bedroom mirror.
Lately, I've been trying to change things in my life and I start off strong with encouragement, but I tend to slip after some time. This happened to me in basketball when I had to practice defense but struggled to pass the ball. Does this happen to you as well?
I am trying to practice being more open in situations, but I find it difficult because I'm always worried about making a mistake or taking a risk. Can you give me some advice on how to overcome this fear of making mistakes?
I had a slip where the ball was sort of in my hands at first, but it got away. It's like honesty, where sometimes it's in your hands and then, as soon as somebody asks, it's hard to be honest.
I've been feeling anxious lately, especially when I do things where I need to explain something in detail. Once, I had to describe a scenario involving a cookie, but I just couldn't find the right words, and I felt embarrassed because of the mistakes I made while describing.
I have a problem with lying about eating sugary foods. I fear that people won't believe me when I say I didn't eat something because I've lied about it in the past.
Lately, I've been struggling with being honest about my actions and feelings. For example, if I hurt someone or didn't brush my teeth, I'd admit it to my mom only because others saw me do it.
I've realized that in the past, I sometimes lied about brushing my teeth, but now I want to be more honest so that people will believe me more. Why is honesty so important to me?
I've noticed that some young people don't value honesty as much, but for me, it's crucial because my mom has always told me that without honesty, there's no respect, and I believe her 100%.
I've been practicing basketball, but I'm struggling with passing and shooting while running. I feel like I need to improve my skills in these areas. Do you have any advice or exercises to help me with this?
Lately, I've been struggling with a lot of stress and anxiety, and it's starting to affect my daily life. I finally decided to reach out and talk about it, and I think the conversation really helped me.
I am struggling with intrusive thoughts and don't know how to handle them in situations when things aren't too bad. Could you give me some advice on what I can do?
I like to play chess with my mom, and I get tense when I'm in the karate hall.
As a patient, I have been trying the relaxation techniques you suggested, but sometimes I find it difficult. I remember the part where I have to tense my fists, breathe in, and then breathe out.
I'm sad that my friend Chris has left, but I'm hoping to make new friends in the future. I've been working on a chart with my therapist to cope with my emotions, and we'll be discussing additional tips next time. How do you think things have gone with my therapy so far?
I used to have a close friend named Chris, but we have fallen apart. Since Chris left, I've been nervous about making new friends.
I've been feeling really lonely lately and worry that I'll never have any friends. I did have one good friend, Chris, but he moved away. I also had other friends in the past, but I'm struggling to make new ones now.
I can't breathe during panic attacks, and I don't know what to do when they come on. I can detect them coming on quite early, but I just feel nervous and don't know what to do.
Lately, when I start feeling anxious, my heart races and I start sweating and shaking. I know it's the beginning of a panic attack, but I don't know how to stop it.
I'm feeling overwhelmed with all the thoughts in my head, but I think I can try to regain control of myself by observing my surroundings. I see notices for sports events, and it helps me to distract myself. Then, after I've slowed down my breathing, I want to go back to doing my exercises.
I don't really want to forget my friend, but I feel very upset about him leaving. I constantly think about the last day when he left and it makes me emotional. I hope to stay in touch with him.
I recently found out that my close friend is transferring to another school which came as a complete shock to me. I thought I'd be alright, but I'm feeling upset by this change. Also, my confidence levels have been low, even before my friend left. I don't know if I've ever had confidence.
I've always been a bit nervous and wished I could be more confident. I find it difficult to meet and talk to new people. On a confidence scale of 0 to 10, I would rate myself around 0 to 2.
I felt a bit nervous about coming for this treatment because I'm not sure if I can do it. I want to change and stop feeling upset and unhappy all the time.
I feel upset most of the time, and it's different from my normal self. I really care about my friend Chris and I wish I could go out there, but I'm too small and get picked on at school.
I am struggling with my appearance, and I have no friends, which makes me feel unhappy. Another thing that's bothering me is that I'm upset about Chris leaving.
Lately, I've been feeling upset and tired. My energy levels are so low that I don't have the motivation to do things, and I often end up doing nothing. I feel weak, bored, and I sometimes suffer from headaches and even feel sick.
Last night, when the phone rang and my mom picked it up, I felt excited. I was just thinking that I don't want to be on my own and I want to ask so much about having someone as a friend.
I had thoughts connected to the phone call. I thought my mom would pick up the phone and it would be Chris, but it wasn't. It made me feel like I'll never speak to him again, and it brought back a lot of memories and pictures.
When I feel very, very happy, it feels like I have no worries, really.
I'm feeling pretty bad because I'm always upset all the time since my friend Chris left. On a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being very upset, I would put myself at a 10.
I've had a very bad week, feeling sad and unhappy.
I'm always like, I always like crying and feeling less.
I have been feeling upset, angry, and sad lately. It's hard for me to separate my emotions. I started a diary about a week ago, and I've written down my responses to various situations for you to see.
I wish I could handle my emotions better. Last Monday night, I was at the karate club, and I kept thinking about Chris. I started shaking and sweating, and it got so bad that Andy had to call my mom to come and pick me up.
I was feeling really panicky and shaky after thinking about my friend Chris and how I needed to face life without him. This thought keeps coming back to me and I also have these pictures related to him.
I am feeling down since my friend Chris left and I am not getting any calls from other friends, so it seems like I don't have anyone else.
I don't know. Not again. I'm worried that if I've done it once, it might be a possibility that I'll do it again. Also, imagine if Chris, someone I care about a lot, said that he'll never have any friends and would be alone for the rest of his life, I would probably be his friend and go with him if that's okay.
As a patient, I told my counsellor about my friend Chris, who has moved away, and how I worry that I'll never have any friends. I mentioned that Chris would probably say he would still be my friend and that we've known each other since I was nine years old.
As a patient, I've been having frequent anxiety attacks, and I've been keeping a diary to record my thoughts and experiences during these episodes. I've become quite good at identifying the thoughts that go through my head when I feel low and depressed. Now, I am trying to focus on the most frequent thoughts and see if I can modify and understand them.
I felt really low and fed up last Sunday night because I had this thought that I'll never have any friends. This thought comes frequently to me now. I don't have any friends currently, and I feel like I don't really deserve anyone since my friend Chris left.
Ever since Chris left, I have this thought that I'll never have any friends. Even if I'm ready, sometimes I don't want to move out. I don't understand, I go for the people and I do adjust, but I still struggle with it. Whenever I think about the fallout with Chris, I feel like I can't fight it.
I've been going swimming with my dad lately, who is an engineer. We've also spent time together working on our car. I want to be an engineer when I'm older, and these experiences have made me feel really good and happy.
I didn't really have any worries then, and I could do anything I thought was alright and well. When I think about my future, I want to be an engineer like my dad which makes me feel sometimes they're proud to own me.
I feel angry when my mom keeps reminding me about my homework. It annoys me and I get really tense and wound up inside.
I've got no friends now, but I stay too worried about time. I sometimes get angry with my mom. When I'm angry, it's mainly because she's always nagging me.
I feel like my mom is always nagging me and she can't leave me alone. She would get angry a lot of times and it's really upsetting.
I am worried about losing my independence and I don't know what to expect when I go to the nursing home. This fear of the unknown is really bothering me.
I've been living in my house for many years and I know it inside out. I have a fear of the unknown and I'm thinking of maybe visiting new places to get used to different surroundings. I hope to feel more at ease by familiarizing myself with new environments like where they cook and meeting new people.
I want to go and see the Long Term Care Facility for myself. I know people have told me it's okay, but I want to see it with my own eyes because I'm afraid of losing my independence.
I recently had a conversation with my grandmother, and she seemed to be showing concern for my youthfulness and expressed that she wished she could be there to help me out.
I'm feeling overwhelmed since my husband passed away and now my friend in the nursing home just passed away due to diabetes. I'm living down here alone, with only my daughter nearby who is busy with work, while my two sons are far away in Nebraska.
I have been feeling a bit lonely lately, and my counsellor suggested building more social support. There is a community center nearby where they have activities for adults like playing bingo. I love playing bingo, and I think it would be a good place to meet new people.
I used to go to bingo sessions a lot with my husband, but since I've been alone, I haven't felt like going. However, I think I can start going back to meet people and let them know I've changed. We used to have little fairs and events, and people would pick me up for them.
As a patient, I was telling my grandmother Tita about the ABC Community Center I found near our area. I had called them to inquire if they provide pick-up services since my grandmother has mobility issues.
I'm an older woman, and I don't do much. I might be able to go somewhere tomorrow, and I know the person I'm with would be able to say, 'Okay, let's go tomorrow.' We could possibly go to look at the same place.
I'm having trouble deciding on the best places to go and I think I could use some help on relaxation.
I feel at ease when I look at the places I have visited before, like when I visited my friend. However, I really want to see a design on them to make them look more attractive. I think if I get to see these designs, I might not need to do the relaxation exercises anymore. Anyway, I plan to tell my daughter about it, and I know she will take me tomorrow. She already has one or two places in mind.
I'm thinking about transitioning into a long-term care facility, and I've been talking to my counsellor about relaxation techniques. She asked me if we should keep relaxation as one of the goals in this process. I agreed that it's a good idea to keep working on relaxation.
I recently transitioned to a nursing home and I'm feeling a loss of independence. I used to do things for myself and now I can't. It's really bothering me and it's one of my biggest problems. I want to be able to do at least most of the things for myself, even though I know I might not be able to do everything like I used to.
I want to still be able to do a lot of things for myself even though I'm moving into a long term care facility. I'm not sure if I can have some independence there.
As a patient, I struggle to do many things by myself and would like to set a goal to be more independent.
Since my hip surgery, my heart starts to beat really fast, my breath gets short, and I have difficulty sleeping. I used to have good dreams about my children and husband, but now I'm experiencing nightmares.
I've been having nightmares about going into a nursing home, especially since my daughter, pastor, and doctor are all telling me that I need to go. I'm not sure about nursing homes, but I came to you for guidance.
Even after my surgery, I'm going to need someone to look after me all the time. The doctor suggested a nursing home to my daughter, but I would have rather stayed with her or my sons. I left the Bahamas, where I come from, over 20 years ago; it's a beautiful place.
I used to take care of my children and elderly family members at home. My mom used to live with us, and we took care of everyone until they passed away.
I've been feeling anxious lately, and I read in the Bible that we should be anxious for nothing, as God will take care of everything. I have my Bible sectioned out, so when I get the opportunity, I can look into it. We've been working on relaxation techniques to help calm my environment.
I haven't been having any panic attacks, just a little bit of an anxious feeling. After I do my relaxation and have my cup of tea, I read the Bible and it helps bring my anxiety down from an eight to a two.
I don't leave this nowhere, this stays with me all the time. God is always with me, and I feel comforted by that.
I feel a mix of emotions, as this is our final session and I'm about to move to the Long Term Care Facility. I'm both excited and nervous about living in a partially supervised apartment instead of having 24-hour care.
I've been feeling anxious whenever the topic of moving to a long-term care facility is brought up. My heart beats fast, and I experience shortness of breath. On a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the most anxiety I've ever felt, I'm not sure where to place this feeling.
I feel like a nine on the anxiety scale, even after reading the scripture. My memory seems to be getting worse too.
I used to have a lot of anxiety, probably around a 10, but I've made progress and now I feel good and calm down to a 2.
As the patient, I am discussing scripture with my counsellor, and I mentioned that I can't remember where a specific scripture comes from.
I've been feeling anxious lately, and my grandmother shared a verse from the Bible to help me. She said, 'Be anxious for nothing, because God takes care of everything.' I believe it's from the Bible, but I can't remember where exactly.
I've been feeling really anxious about the idea of moving to a nursing home since my children suggested it after my fall. My heart beats really fast, my breath gets short, and I start feeling some pain. I came to see you only because my pastor advised me to do so.
I've been experiencing back and neck pain, a fast heartbeat, and shortness of breath. Additionally, I used to sleep really well, but now I can't sleep, even though my routine hasn't changed.
Recently, I underwent surgery and ever since, I've been experiencing difficulties in sleeping. I keep thinking about who will take care of me and how I'm going to cope with these problems. I'm feeling so stressed.
I think the staff at the facility know how to treat older people because they are educated. However, if I ever feel like they don't treat me well, I would try to talk to one or two of them, but not argue as I am older.
I feel like I need someone to talk to when I'm not feeling okay. I can reach out to the owner of the facility or the social worker, but sometimes I don't want to involve my children.
I sometimes struggle with telling my daughter what's good for her. My mind tends to wander, and I find it hard to focus.
I had trouble sleeping but after reading some scriptures, I felt at peace and was able to sleep through the night. I woke up at my usual time to pray.
As the patient, I feel some changes happening in my life, like the heart beating fast, shortness of breath, and pains come back. I am also trying to cope with my husband's absence and make things the way I want them to be.
I've been practicing the relaxation techniques we've been working on, but I still find myself struggling with thoughts like being put away from my children. I'm having difficulty reframing these thoughts.
I'm worried that the people in the partial supervision facility might not treat me well, as I've seen in movies and heard stories about how they don't really take care of the residents.
I am more worried about how people in the new place might treat me, as an older person. I hope they are nice and respectful towards the elderly since they also go to school.
I rely on my faith to help me through difficult times and fear. I carry the Bible with me everywhere I go. One of my favorite verses is Proverbs 3:4,5 which says, 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not onto your own understanding; in all your ways, acknowledge Him and He shall direct my path.'
I am afraid of moving into a long-term care facility because I am not sure what will happen to me there. My faith in God is important to me and I try to follow His guidance in everything I do.
I am feeling unsure about moving to a home, as my children suggest. I never really looked at it that way, but my daughter will be there with me too. I'm trying to find comfort in a famous scripture that I always look at.
I mean in that, that really a, a scripture that really helps me through the day. And I know going to this path, a new thing in my life, going to the nursing home he's gonna, he's gonna help me.
I've been living alone since my mom passed away, and I took good care of her. I want to live with my children, but I know they have their own lives in the States, and it's different from how I grew up in the Bahamas. I'm trying to find peace with this, but I'm constantly feeling anxious and stressed. My heart races and I have shortness of breath.
I recently had a hip surgery and my doctor told me that my health is good. However, I've been experiencing feelings of anxiety. I also feel like my children are distancing themselves from me because of our cultural differences since I'm from the Bahamas and they act more like Americans.
I've been taking care of myself since my husband died 20 years ago. I do everything for myself, including washing, cleaning, and cooking. I don't want anyone else to take care of me.
I've discussed my goals with you and plan to find out about different long-term care facilities and visit them with my daughter. We will be working together on these goals and complete them before transitioning to the selected facility.
I recently transitioned to a long-term care facility and my pastor recommended me to see a therapist. I brought my Bible with me to the therapy session.
I used to be scared because I thought I'd end up in a nursing home like my friend who passed away from diabetes, where I'd need 24-hour care. But now I know I'm just moving to an apartment with supervision and help. Can we discuss a backup plan in case I start feeling anxious after the transition?
I'm a patient who has been going to therapy, and I'm about to move into a partial supervisions facility. I'm feeling anxious about the transition, especially leaving my home where I lived with my husband and children. My therapist is helping me develop a Relax Prevention Plan to cope with these feelings.
I am feeling overwhelmed as I am about to go through a period of transition where I will have to move to a new place, and I am afraid that I might feel sad and lonely without my husband who was not living in this place with me.
I'm feeling a bit lost and unsure about this new start and beginning in my life. Can you help me understand how to cope with this feeling?
I am concerned about what type of care they are providing to the patients and how they are handling different things.
I have some goals that I'm excited about, especially the last one which involves going somewhere I haven't been to in a long time. But I really need to get out and I might need my daughter's help with transportation.
I am worried about how I'd get to some places I need to visit over the next week, but my daughter said she'd help me along with my pastor.
Ever since my husband passed away, I've been trying not to burden my children. My two sons live in another state while my daughter does her best to help me. I don't want to be a burden on them and I don't have many friends or other people for support except my kids.
I've been feeling a bit lonely lately, even though I have Jesus with me. I've had support from my church and friends, but seeing some of my friends die in recent years has made me hesitant and cautious. I sometimes feel left behind and miss their presence.
As the patient, I've been working on developing a problem list and putting things in order together with my counsellor. We're about to move on to another part of our session soon.
I am having difficulty reading and I have my reading glasses on. This has been causing me distress.
I have been having trouble with my reading glasses and I need help to learn how to relax.
I think doing the relaxing activities will help me with my heart problems. What's your suggestion?
I am feeling fearful about choosing a new place to visit, but I think visiting the place will help me a lot because I will know where I'm going and it might make me feel more comfortable.
I've been having some issues with nightmares lately, and I'm also experiencing heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Interestingly, I noticed that these physical symptoms occur at the same time when I'm talking about these nightmares.
I've been thinking about the possibility of losing my independence and having to move to different nursing homes. This is making me feel anxious and not knowing how to calm myself down. I need help with learning how to relax and handle these situations.
I've been experiencing shortness of breath and it gets worse when I think about it. I believe learning more about this issue may help my heart and alleviate the problem, but I'm not sure.
I'm having a hard time dealing with the loss of independence, such as transitioning to long-term care. This loss is causing me a lot of stress, anxiety, and an increased heartbeat.
I've been struggling with the loss of sleep lately, and it's becoming a big concern for me. However, after watching the news, I find myself sleeping all the way up to five o'clock in the morning. While it's a lot of sleep, I still get up and pray afterwards.
I've been struggling with my sleep patterns and have a fear of being put away. I also find it difficult to understand my children as they grew up in America and have different values than I did growing up in the Bahamas. I've tried to instill some of my cultural values in them, but sometimes it hurts me when I don't understand their perspectives.
I feel like my marriage didn't work out because there were unaddressed issues and expectations. I think if I could do it over again, I would be friends first and lovers later since friendship is a much stronger foundation. This was something that didn't work well in my marriage.
I feel like they went head over heels for each other, but it didn't last very long. It feels good and should happen in sports, but as a foundation for marriage, it takes a lot of work. If it's only based on that, it's possible, but challenging. Once that initial head over heels fades, it really depends on the two people involved.
I've been thinking about how to approach my next serious relationship and I believe it's essential to ensure both partners are happy with themselves, willing to work on the relationship, and own up to their faults. Can you provide me any insights or guidance on how to achieve that?
I have a friend who seems to have this aura of knowing all about her. She apparently knows certain things, but won't just say it. Instead, she waits and lets us go through the experience and make mistakes.
I've been finding it difficult to remember certain parts of my past. For example, when I try to think back to when I was five, some memories and details seem fuzzy.
I remember sitting in my playhouse by myself for hours with my legs folded. I don't know why I did that, I think I just ran. What can you make of this?
I felt like I did something wrong and was scared because I didn't know what was going on. I also remember an incident in third grade that made me feel scared.
As a patient, I am unsure if I will marry someone I don't know yet, but I do want to be in a committed relationship eventually. I love my job as a teacher and want to continue in it. I want to raise my boys, letting them make their own decisions as they grow older. My happiness derives from watching them grow, overcome challenges, and make plans for themselves.
As a patient, my happiness is seeing my children cope well with their divorced parents who don't get along. I delayed my divorce because I was worried about how it would affect them. Now, my goal is to eventually have a relationship and maybe a commitment, and to continue supporting my children.
I'm more like my dad, but as I get older I'm looking a little bit more like my mom. I do have a lot of both of them in me. The difference between my mom and I immediately I think of is that I had the support of my husband when I was pursuing my career. My mom did not have that support from my dad. That was one of the snags in the marriage.
With my ex-husband, we agreed on my career. He was completely supportive of me moving forward and never held me back or objected to any decisions I made in that regard.
I feel like my success at work and my career have taken a toll on my relationships. I think it's because I've been so focused on my own success that I've neglected to appreciate others and, in turn, don't feel appreciated myself. It's like a cycle of not being supportive.
I recently realized that I don’t put as much work into other things, like relationships. When I look back at my marriage, I worked at it but could have focused differently. I didn't really know what marriage involved, so I don’t want to make the same mistake again. I learned about marriage by watching my parents, and I know what I really wanted was togetherness.
I was just talking about my siblings - my sister is married, but my brothers aren't. My youngest brother recently got engaged, which is exciting! But, my oldest brother hasn't settled down yet and I think he's scared of commitment.
I am a patient who enjoys roller coasters even though they can be scary. Each time I go on a roller coaster, the experience is different. I keep going back for more rides, and right now, on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my happiness as 9.5.
I am the oldest sibling and my sister is one year younger than me. I can recall when I was 12 years old, but it doesn't feel like that long ago.
When I was around 12 years old, I enjoyed school and spending time with my family. I had a younger brother who I adored, and I often took care of him. Our family got along well, but as kids, we would argue and vie for position in the family hierarchy.
I've been struggling with my ex-husband's habit of being late, and I worry that it will make my son late for his summer program. I've dealt with this issue during our marriage, but now I need to find a way to not let it affect me.
I always get upset when my ex-husband comes in 30 minutes late, but now I know the reason behind it. I want to try and not get upset the next time this happens.
I'm struggling with someone who always comes late, and I don't know how to handle it. I feel like I need to fix this issue, but I'm not sure what button to push or what to tell myself when it happens.
As a patient, I tend to try fixing things on my own, similar to how my dad does. He always took care of everything and I started following his footsteps.
I am tired of putting myself in other people's shoes all the time and constantly trying to fix their problems. I feel like I shouldn't have to do this, but I find it hard to stop because I'm so used to it.
Sometimes, when my children are bickering or fighting, I step back and let them work it out, even though it's hard for me. I tell myself that I'm doing the right thing, because they need to learn to resolve their issues on their own. I remember one time when I had to force myself to stay seated and not intervene while they worked things out.
I've been struggling with certain past issues, even with my husband who would sometimes push a different button that would upset me. I'm still experiencing this now when certain things happen.
I've been feeling nervous about coming in for my counselling sessions, and we haven't had a chance to talk properly yet. I appreciate you having me fill out the forms and paperwork to better understand my situation.
I am going through a transition right now, I recently got divorced and now I am a single mom with two sons.
I am moving into the last year of my 30s and I am the oldest among my siblings. We are four children in my family, two girls and two boys, I and my sister being the older ones, while the two youngest are boys.
Lately, I've been discussing with my family and friends about life being like an amusement park with a choice of rides. We've talked about how some people ride the merry-go-round while others choose the roller coaster. This metaphor has been quite interesting and useful for me, showing the difference between existing in life and actually living it.
I have realized that I have had to look out for myself too much due to my upbringing, and as a result, I wasn't as considerate and thoughtful towards other people's needs as I should have been.
I feel sorry for being very headstrong and determined in my career and other things we did together as husband and wife. I think by doing that, I pushed my husband out of being the responsible man and took on his role unintentionally. I believe I hindered his growth and development by jumping on and starting things.
I regret not being able to devote more time to my partner because I was focused on my career and responsibilities at home. If I could do it again, I would step back from those responsibilities to give him more attention. But he says I wasn't giving him happiness, and now I am confused about what he really wanted.
I've been trying to make my friend happy, but I just can't seem to find the right way. What should I do?
I always knew I wanted to be a mother, and that gave me a chance to do that. So in a way, my father really did have an influence on my life. I feel more responsible than most of my brothers or sisters as far as being a mom.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with the expectations I put on myself as the oldest child. I tend to be a perfectionist and feel responsible for pleasing others. Is this a common issue among oldest children?
I used to try to please others all the time, but I don't do it as much now. I still have aspirations, but they don't control me. I'm enjoying where I am now and have a few small future plans. I'm still athletic and busy, and I'm probably the most responsible one in my family because I have two children.
Recently, my sister and I both went through divorces. She has no children and is currently single. She recently started her own business and seems to really enjoy it. She's becoming more serious, responsible, and goal-oriented like me, but she still has a spontaneous side that I don't think will ever leave.
I had a sister named Angeli who was a very amusing person. She kept us laughing a lot and was a performer. Compared to me, she was a bit flighty and spontaneous, while I'm more serious and tend to plan things out.
As a child, I had two younger brothers. When I was 12 and my second brother was nine, he was a quiet kid who liked playing board games and being outside. My youngest brother was born 10 years later, and I was initially upset about it because I felt like I would have to take care of another little person.
I was really concerned about the effect my mom's pregnancy would have on me, until I felt the baby move inside her. After that, my anger started to fade away. When my brother was born, I completely forgot about being mad. At 10 years old, I was able to do things with him that my other siblings couldn't, and I took on a mother role.
I have difficulty appreciating others, because I'm always focusing on myself. I think it's going to make future relationships difficult.
I realize that I am very selfish, almost to a fault. I am aware of this issue, and I am working on it.
I am being honest with myself and admitting that I am selfish on purpose. I think that's the first step in dealing with it. I don't beat myself up about it, though, because I know it's a transition due to my past. I also know that this isn't how I truly am, but it's going to be this way for a while.
I can see that I'm no longer really angry with my ex-husband, and I might even be open to having an acquaintance with him. However, there are still some areas I need to work on, like coming to terms with my selfishness and how it affected our relationship.
Sometimes I struggle when he walks in, and I feel like I'm not doing things right or the way he prefers. It's hard for me to remind myself that I'm doing the best I can, just like he is, and that it's okay to do things differently.
I have realized that the issue with my ex-husband and my current situation has a lot to do with who I am now, starting from when I was a little girl. I never really connected those two aspects of my life until we discussed it today.
I've recently realized that I have some choices with my ex-husband and that a lot of things I am today, I learned in the past. I never looked at it that way before. There was something else that you said earlier in the session that I thought was good, but I can't remember it now.
I have different memories that make me feel a mix of emotions. I remember being in the playhouse, in the kitchen with my mom learning my times tables, and also when I was the queen of the hill. In these memories, the feelings of recognition and independence stand out to me. I felt independent when I could do my times tables without my mom's help, and I felt recognized when I was the queen for the day.
Ever since I was young, I have always wanted to handle things on my own, like the time when President Kennedy died. I wanted to fix it and figure it out all by myself. I still do this as an adult, trying to fix things even when I don't understand what's going on. I feel like it is tied to my independence and desire for recognition.
I remember certain things from my past, and these few recollections seem to be significant. I notice that in situations with conflict and problems, I feel all alone and have to figure things out by myself.
I've always looked out for myself, and I even aimed for the top ten without telling my parents. I just did it on my own, and I'm noticing a pattern here.
I've always felt unappreciated like my dad and I know my mom has been unappreciated as well. I've kept staying in my current situation because I wanted to make things work like they did for my parents. But I can't change others, they have to change themselves.
I think my family, including me and my siblings, share this feeling of not being appreciated. We don't necessarily need constant praise, but some recognition would be nice.
During my marriage, I distanced myself from my family to please my ex-husband and make him feel like the top priority in my life. I spent less time with my family, missed holidays, and even went a whole year without talking to them. I did all this to prove my love for him and show that my family wasn't more important than him.
I did something that I thought was right at the time, but I didn't receive any positive feedback from my family or my significant other. I've started considering counseling. Recently, I talked to my mom for a good hour and a half, and the first word that comes to mind is positive.
I am determined to find happiness, which to me means being able to live with the good and the bad that comes every day, fixing things when I can and letting go when I can't. However, I am not sure about where I am heading or what my happiness looks like.
I have been feeling a bit down lately, but I don't think it's serious enough to discuss right now. Maybe we can talk about it later?
As a patient, I recently started talking to my mother again after a period of not being close to her. She's very stubborn but dedicated to her family, which I like. Now, we talk two times a week, but sometimes we miss a week or two.
Although I see my family at least every couple of weeks and talk to them on a weekly basis, there used to be a time when I didn't do that. This was when I was married because my husband didn't like my family, and my family didn't like him, so it was a problem.
I've been struggling with my family's initial disapproval of my spouse, especially my mom. At first, my siblings were supportive, but my mother was always reluctant and had a different perspective on the situation. It caused conflicts during our wedding, and I constantly try to prove them wrong and show that our love is enough to make the relationship work. Recently, I realized that my parents' marriage also had issues and I'm not just chasing an ideal, but I still fight for my relationship.
I’ve gotten a little more spontaneous, but it’s still hard for me to be completely disorganized. My oldest brother is still quiet, stays to himself, and seems unsure of himself. He seems scared to make decisions in his life, and I believe that might be because nobody is stepping in to guide him like he's accustomed to.
My dad worked two jobs to take care of his family. He loved his kids, showed affection, and respected my mother. They had disagreements but never violence. I think he felt sad and unappreciated sometimes due to working so much. I'd describe him as responsible, outgoing, and loving.
I remember when I was about eight or nine years old, my mom and I were working on times tables. I was writing them on the window because she was cooking and the windows were getting stained with condensation. I learned them quickly and easily that day, and I remember feeling good about it. I loved being in the kitchen with my mom while she cooked.
I remember a time when my brothers and sisters and I were in the basement when I was around six years old. We had these boxes we stacked up to make a temple and I was going to be the queen. I climbed on top of the boxes and made my siblings help me build it, but I didn't let them climb up too. The boxes started moving and rocking, some fell and my siblings left me alone up there. I was scared and eventually fell but was okay. I think they got back at me for being bossy, and we never played that game again.
As the patient, I previously engaged in a behavior that has caused me concern. I made a considerable effort to avoid repeating it, and I am proud to report that I have successfully refrained from indulging in that behavior again.
I sometimes lose track of my hands when I go into trance, and I met a woman who had studied with Dr. Erikson, the hypnotist.
She told me the story of how he invited her to his garden after their teaching seminar and how she was very pleased and honored by the invitation. Dr. Erikson had her take plant cuttings with garden shears and then told her, 'That's good enough.' Later in life, when she was going through a difficult time, she remembered his words and it made her realize that she was good enough.
I really wanted to stop smoking and I knew I could do it, but I wasn't sure if I could quit forever. I wanted to remain a non-smoker and was committed to getting extra help to stack the deck in my favor. I thought hypnosis might be a good way to ensure success.
I've experienced hypnosis before but it was a while ago. I remember it being a unique experience and shifting my perspective, but I don't recall the details. I'm also not sure if my past experience followed a traditional approach or not. Can you help me access those memories of the hypnotic shift?
I've recently made a significant shift in my life to take better care of myself, like going to bed earlier and focusing on nurturing myself. It has been a long-term change, and I feel that I need some support to maintain this new lifestyle. I'm wondering how to access the necessary resources for keeping up this change? Can you offer any suggestions?
I have trouble letting go of the day and not trying to fit so many things in at the end of the day. However, when I visit my family back home or when my grandchildren visit, I find it easier to let go and go to sleep earlier. I am not sure why this happens.
I've been feeling like a part of me isn't fulfilled by just work and daily responsibilities. Being with my family, especially my grandkids, seems to feed that part of me.
I feel like I'm always taking care of other people's needs and hardly have time for myself. However, I do feel fulfilled when my grandkids visit or when I host a party at my house and have a great time.
I've been struggling for years with going to bed too late and it's affecting my weight and self-esteem. I don't sleep enough and I don't exercise enough as well. Even at a conference, I can't make myself get up early.
I’ve been struggling with staying up late and packing too much into my day. I realize that I don't have this issue when I'm back in my hometown, where I can go to bed when everyone else does, rather than trying to fit more activities into the day.
I have been trying to find ways to create a space for myself, but I have so much other stuff to do. I need some advice on how to balance everything.
I get filled up with wonderful interpersonal interactions, and the joy of relating and exchanging with others feels satisfying. However, I'm trying to find something else that nurtures me or feeds my soul. For example, I've heard that playing music can be quite fulfilling. What are your thoughts on this?
I did a pilgrimage on the way of Saint James, also known as El Camino de Santiago in Spain, as a way to challenge myself physically and as a 60th birthday gift to myself. I am not an athlete, so this was a physically demanding experience for me, and as the journey went on, the challenge increased because I was getting tired and the road got harder.
I had accomplished something very concrete each evening after walking so many miles, and it was me and the trail. It was me and this spiritual connection that began to happen, which wasn't about God.
As a patient, I find it difficult to let go of my responsibilities at night, and I feel like I have too many duties. I've succeeded and worked hard in life, but I feel like I'm constantly nurturing others without nurturing myself. I'm considering phone calls, spending time with my grandkids, and dinner parties to help me feel more satisfied with my day.
I stopped smoking 37 years ago with the help of hypnosis. I had quit on my own before but ended up going back to it after a year or two. I think I wanted to stop and believed that I needed a little extra help.
I was on my way to accomplishing something, but I wasn't sure if I was going to succeed. So, I sought some extra help because I thought I needed a little booster. What made me think I needed that extra help?
I wanted to ask a question but the microphone was not working initially. I was finally able to thank the counsellor for their help and express my appreciation for their openness and willingness to assist.
I've been struggling with something recently, and I decided to take some time to reflect on my situation and try to access my inner resources. However, I still feel a bit lost and disconnected from the present moment. Do you think I have done enough to work on my issue?
I think I wanna sit with it.
I think there's this Maggie that is so driven by duty that to take the time to do things like having a dinner party seems impossible. However, I was thinking maybe it's practical to have phone calls with my sisters and parents instead.
I've been staying up late and neglecting self-nurturing. There are six of us, and my parents are still alive. I can call one of them daily, spend more time with my grandkids, and occasionally plan dinner parties. How can I break this old habit and not feel overwhelmed?
I am trying to think of activities that I can do to bring more nurturing and joy into my life, besides dinner parties and spending time with my grandkids or walking the Camino Trail. I can walk with a friend in the morning, and I can create a challenge for myself at the gym. The latter would be stimulating for me.
I recently drove to Nevada and had dinner with my ex-husband without feeling the urge to choke him out. I've been using humor to keep things light and I feel like our relationship has improved enough for us to be friends. A couple of years ago, this definitely wouldn't have been possible, and my kids see me in a different and better place now.
I believe that time can heal many things. I have been focusing on self-analysis, counseling for myself, and growing as an individual.
I find it really difficult to talk about this issue because it's so personal to me.
I have to share that my partner kept this old wine bottle from the late 70s or early 80s, and we used to drink from it together. It had a spout and an ice compartment to keep the wine cool. We had some playful, fun exchanges while using it. I felt really good about those experiences.
I recently went on a trip where I had to drive through 14 miles of snow chains on Interstate 80. It was difficult and a bit dangerous, but I couldn't wait to get to my destination. Overall, it was worth it.
I recently shared a story with my counsellor about a time when I felt pleased with myself and my kids saw the love and strength coming through me. I felt accomplished and that my efforts as a parent were paying off.
I recently went to my ex-husband's house for dinner, which was quite a challenge as it has been a difficult time for me these past five years. He cooked my spaghetti recipe, and even though the children were nervous, I managed to handle the situation and was proud of myself.
I had to forgive my ex in order to attend a family gathering with him. I had been holding onto anger and needed to let go of it for the sake of our children, who were happy that we were all coming together. However, if they hadn't been there, I wouldn't have gone to dinner with him.
I don't see a reason to do that because... No.
I remember a time recently when I finally felt able to be in the same room with my ex-husband. I've been divorced for five years and never thought it would be possible. It happened just before Christmas, after I had moved back to Southern California in 2005.
I wanted to see all my grown children together for the holidays, so I drove to Reno with my son from California. We went through 14 miles of snow to get there, and I was determined to make it happen. When we arrived, my ex-husband invited us all to his house for dinner, which was unexpected. I just wanted to spend time with my children at my daughter's house in Reno.
I had a spaghetti dinner with my ex-husband, and it went better than I expected. I'm not angry anymore and I think he wants forgiveness too, but it was scary because I didn't know how he would receive me.
I am a woman who loves her kids, has a lot of strength, and is fearless. My children know me as a strong and loving person.
As a patient, I would like to know how my three kids, who describe me as determined, a leader, thoughtful, and friendly, perceive me.
I was in a 28-year relationship with my ex-husband. We have been divorced for five years, and I recently had dinner at his place. I'm not sure how much of that time was preparation time for me.
I have been preparing for the past five years, and one of the first things I did was to go for counseling for 18 weeks to discuss the issues that led to my divorce and my role in it. This helped me understand that it wasn't just my ex-spouse's fault, but mine too.
I have been thinking about this issue sporadically over the last five years.
I cooked a dish the way my mother used to, and my husband really liked it. It was pretty funny because I didn't tell him that I got the recipe from my mother. He thinks we don't share these things with men.
I am all through the house, and it's a whole different situation. My ex-husband bought another house after our divorce, and he kept a lot of things from our past. We split the belongings, as is common in divorces.
I don't know if you know, but my partner kept all the little dust collectors, you know, things that he put in the kitchen, in the recess area of the cabinetry, and I used to put things on top too.
I'm glad I got counseling after my divorce. Time heals everything, but I don't think I could have done it without the counseling. I would never have been able to see the different level or be at the place I am now.
I feel that counseling has helped me a lot. I've given it some time and thought, and I've managed to put aside a lot of things that don't matter anymore. However, I recently found out that a family member has been using my spaghetti recipe all these years without me knowing.
I had a taste of a dish that was made just like how I used to cook it, which is actually my mom's recipe. I found it hilarious that someone else has perfected it.
I recently saw my daughter and met my grandchildren. I knew eventually it would happen, but I didn't know when. My family wasn't surprised, they just wanted to know I would be cool about it. I've been to the city many times to see my children, and I knew he was there too, so I thought eventually I would run into him.
I know that my family knew something was going to happen and it did the week before Christmas. I am concerned about what my kids will learn from this situation where we have been hurt or angered. I want them to step back and not get too involved.
I have been trying to take myself out of certain situations and focus on how others can benefit from what I'm doing. I noticed how my ex-husband enjoyed being with others and reminiscing, and it made me realize it's not always about me.
I didn't use to think my alcohol and cocaine abuse was a problem because I considered myself more of an enabler. However, the situation kept escalating and the next thing I knew, I was broke and out.
I know that I shouldn't drink alcohol, but I still do it. I have been home now for 21 days.
I've been drinking since I've been out. I haven't got to the point of being intoxicated, but I know it's not good either. I think it would be a lot better if I didn't drink after this.
I don't feel bad, but I also don't feel good. I haven't got to abusing myself or doing anything harmful, but I worry that it could get out of hand again.
As a patient, I feel like my life has become messed up as I got older. I always wanted to be a counsellor and work with kids, but now I feel like I can't do much to help them. I just wish I could do something to make a difference in their lives.
I really admire a certain person and I feel inspired by their energy and the way they are. Being around them brings out the best in me and makes me feel special and tender. I believe it could help me become the responsible person I want to be.
I feel like I want to help kids and avoid them going through the same experiences I did. However, I think I need to re-enroll in school and get re-educated to be able to effectively help them. I know I can't do this while still struggling with my drinking problem.
You know, I gotta get, you know I get amused. I really open up with my little nephews and this, that, and the other. I get to playing with them. And, you know, it just seems like it brings them to me because I let them ride on me and punch on me. And we go out in the yard and play with them. Then I get tired and I come in and well, then I'm old now. The alcohol then helps me relax and makes me a little more sociable, especially with kids.
I always wanted to be natural and be on a natural high. I love kids, they are the future.
I find that idle time is one of my enemies. If I have nothing to do, I reach for a drink. But if I keep myself busy, I feel alright. I enjoy fishing and walking as relaxing activities that don't involve drinking.
I could read and I like music, barbecuing, and fishing. But it's no good if I don't put these activities to use. Maybe I should spend more time with my kids, taking them to the park.
I feel like it's time for me to visit my mother, but I am scared that I might slip back into my old habits. I usually admit when I'm wrong, and it breaks my heart that my family has so much faith in me. If I were to slip, I'd probably feel too guilty to face them, and might need to go back into therapy or treatment.
I've been using various tools to cope with my cravings, but I'm worried that if I slip, it'll be difficult to face my family due to guilt and shame. I think as long as I have someone to lean on and get professional help before it gets out of hand, I might be able to handle it, but I am not fully confident.
I've gained a lot more confidence in myself than before. However, there are times when my actions have led me into some trouble, and I've traveled down roads I don't want to revisit. I have managed to stay abstinent from cocaine, but I'm concerned about alcohol now.
I used to stand on the street all night, and it just took its toll on me. I got tired of being run down. I feel pretty confident that I won't slip back into cocaine, but I used to make efforts to quit three years ago as well.
I've been trying to stay away from drugs and just keep myself busy so that I won't fall back on it. However, I'm still actively drinking, and that bothers me somewhat. It relaxes me, and I don't know, it's just something about it.
I've been in treatment programs before, and what I want from a therapist is the same as what I want from anyone in the street: the truth. I just want someone to tell me what they think would be best.
As a patient, I express my openness to receiving advice, especially good advice. I tend to analyze different options, and sometimes it can be overwhelming to make decisions about what's best for me, but I still appreciate guidance.
As a patient, I feel emotional about the kids, and it hurts to see them run around dirty and wondering where their parents are. However, I'm proud that I took care of my own children and never let them experience such hardships.
I was constantly in and out of different places, but I never harmed my child and nobody else's child.
I first came here looking around, thinking that I should have been sitting at a desk. I believe I have a reasonable amount of intelligence.
I used to avoid my family and spend time on the streets, but now my family is pulling me closer. My sister passed away this year, and I promised her I would get my life together. My mother and others have noticed a big change in me.
I don't know if you noticed or not, but, but I, I do feel a little, a little emotional. I don't know if you see it or not. I am feeling emotional, especially when I talk about those children and getting my life together which is a lifelong project.
I recently got released from the penitentiary and have used cocaine, which I haven't used in a while. Last year, I drank alcohol regularly and now I am trying to avoid getting intoxicated. I have been busy with my family, but it seems they don't understand me and I want to work on improving my situation.
I have been in recovery for cocaine addiction and tried three different programs, but they didn't work for me at the time. I was once off it for three years, and now I've been clean for over a year. I got tired of being broke and feeling disgusted with myself. The more I used, the further behind I got.
I've been clean from cocaine for a year now, but I still struggle with alcohol. I got tired of feeling run down and embarrassed, not having money even for basic things like bus fare or cigarettes. I still hang out with some of the same people, but I made the decision to quit because of how it made me feel.
I've been struggling with cocaine use and trying to cut back on alcohol. I want to find a balance where I don't feel too good or too comfortable.
I have been feeling better when I'm busy with activities, such as painting rooms or working on roofs and drywalls. I think it would help a lot if I could show others what I know and learn together with them.
I am finally being the person that I should have been a long time ago. I am trying to set the example that I should have set when I was younger. I knew all the time that what I was doing was wrong, but I don't have any excuse. However, now I have a plan.
I try to stay away from it and avoid certain people. I've started spending my money on things I need or giving it to my relatives, so I don't have to worry about it. I stay closer to my family since they don't use, and I would never do it around them.
I've been doing a lot of things and have been successful for a year but I don't have a plan. It's just the way I do it, and this is how I've been staying away from whatever was bothering me.
I have been trying a strategy to stay away from a certain habit and spend my money elsewhere. It has been working so far and I take it day by day without making any big promises.
I'm not really enjoying the support groups. It feels like every time I go to a different group, I hear the same thing. It seems like people just go from group to group and repeat the same things they've heard.
As a patient, I'm open to providing feedback if I find any advice given during the session to be ridiculous or silly, and I appreciate that this will encourage a healthy partnership.
I think I would be able to tell you if your approach was too harsh. You can call me LC, and I'm comfortable calling you John or JC.
In the past, I got really annoyed when therapists would question how I feel or tell me that I'm not feeling the way I say I am. I think it's important for a therapist to respect and understand my emotions.
I don't have a plan to prevent myself from relapsing or going back to cocaine. I'm just taking it one day at a time.
I've been trying to cut down on my alcohol intake and have been successful in reducing it to just maybe three shots for the past two days. To replace the habit, my family has been keeping me busy with activities like painting and fixing the roof. I'm planning to invest the money I make into a little truck.
I want to start a small contracting business and involve my nephews in it. It may not be a lot of money, but it will be something for all of us to do and we'll be together. They can see that I am not on the street drinking or doing other negative things.
I think the most important thing in the world is education. Without it, you can't grow a business or achieve success. Right now, my main focus is to stay busy with activities like painting to keep my mind occupied.
I just got out of a situation and now I am trying to run a small business.
I'm not saying that I'll never relapse, but I hope and pray that I don't. There are times when I get really strong cravings.
As the patient, I haven't gone back to the issue and I usually get busy, take long walks, or isolate myself from people to cope with it.
I've been trying to make my plan to tackle urges more conscious, but I struggle with knowing which coping tool to use in the moment. I need some guidance on picking the right one from my toolkit.
I've been drinking three to four days a week, and I'm thinking maybe I should try to cut it down to two days a week as a start.
I currently drink about three to four shots, three to four times a week. I want to cut it down to two days and spread the days out, like maybe one in the middle of the week, and the other at the end of the week. I don't want to drink on weekends because it's dangerous.
I feel like I'm taking these shots just to relax. It seems like it's automatic sometimes. I have a sister I go out with, and she has a bar full of alcohol. I guess I just feel like I need to get rid of this habit.
Lately, I've noticed that grabbing a drink sometimes helps me relax, especially after having a couple of shots.
I have a problem with alcohol; it starts out with a couple of drinks, and then I'm shaking and out of it again. I'm aware of this issue and want to change it. However, I've had some therapists in the past who were too pushy, and I don't want that experience again.
I always used to drink to get drunk and never drank to get sober. The only thing better than a drink was another drink for me. I am hoping it doesn't get out of hand again.
I feel like sometimes I just want to snatch everything away at once, but I understand that I need to break myself down a little bit at a time. I believe abstinence is where we want to get, but I worry about pushing it too much.
Recently, I've been worried that making a certain change could end up doing more harm than good.
I feel like people around me are just saying what they hear and not what they really feel. I find individual therapy more helpful because it allows me to focus on myself and not be distracted by so many different personalities and addictions. I also love reading.
I'm struggling with cocaine and alcohol addiction. I have been thinking about writing a book about my experiences, but I'm also a procrastinator. I'm not really into movies or group activities.
I feel like my current treatment is working, but I'm not sure it's going to last. I've been sober for three years before and then succumbed to temptation. I'm worried that it might happen again.
Well, I guess if I get upset. You know, just get upset or, I can't say. You know, like I, I think about it. No, I'm gonna say I don't. I think about it now. But I just, I just never went back yet.
I think starting something new is the hardest part, especially for a procrastinator like me. Once I get started, I can see progress. But getting started is tough. I have four sons and nephews who used to look up to me. They wanted to be like me. Now, they are constantly in and out of the penitentiary.
I've found success in getting my sons on the right path, they have never been locked up, and have attended college and been in the service. I want to start a contracting business to prevent my nephews and other family members from going down the wrong path.
I have mixed feelings about my nephews because they've been involved in some bad behavior and idolized me, which made me feel guilty. I want to turn my life around and hope they can do the same, but I'm sad that they saw me going back to prison.
I feel unlovable and like nobody wants to be in a relationship with me. I always feel like I'm on my own, and people just don't talk to me.
I sometimes feel unlovable, but I remember going to McDonald's with my friends and having a great time. However, I'm still not sure if that means I'm not truly unlovable or not.
Sometimes, I believe in certain things less often than I used to, but challenging those beliefs makes me feel really depressed. It's all about how I feel.
I'm having trouble with making a decision about apologizing and I think it would be quite hard for me to do it. We have already discussed the pros and cons of apologizing, and the next step is to see what happens after I apologize.
I feel like I am improving, and even my mom has noticed it. I've been attending school part-time, which I never thought I would be able to do initially. Keeping a diary and talking to you about everything has been really helpful.
I was discussing with my therapist various options for a problem, and we identified five potential solutions. I was then instructed to focus my energy and attention on the task, and project the outcome of each possible solution.
I've been having a conflict with a friend and I'm considering apologizing, but I just won't do it. I think if I phoned her and apologized, maybe she'd apologize too, and we could at least talk about it. The advantage is that we might solve some things and maybe even become friends again.
I'm worried that if I apologize to my friend after our fight, it might seem like she's getting away with it and it will happen again. I'd feel like I was admitting I was wrong, even though both of us had a part to play in what went wrong.
I was at Jenny's and then Claire arrived. They started talking, left me out completely and so I just came home again. I was really quite upset and put in my diary that I was depressed when I got home. I was 9 out of 10 upset and angry with them for leaving me out, and I felt very lonely.
I feel different and like I don't fit in. I believe that others want me to go home so they can talk about me. I often feel isolated, angry, and lonely, like I am an outsider with no friends and no one loves me.
I'm struggling with the feeling that nobody loves me. I've never really had a good relationship with people, and I don't get along well with others. I haven't had a boyfriend in ages, and I just feel trapped and unliked.
I've been struggling with priorities in my life. The two biggest concerns are my feelings about my future and my performance at school. I gave a score of 8 or 10 for the feelings about my future, but it's not as big as school.
I've been feeling more pleased about myself lately and started liking myself more, but my confidence is still very low, like a 2 out of 10. I also want to feel less depressed and miserable, but my mood on the same scale is really low.
I would rate my mental state as a 6 out of 10. It's not bad when I don't think about school, but if I do think about it, I feel really bad.
Everything has been pretty bad for me recently, especially at school. I have no friends, and I'm always on my own. It's making me quite upset, and I keep thinking about my future.
I feel like I'm going nowhere in life, and I'm always paranoid that people are talking about me and stalking me. I feel very alone and depressed all the time.
I am feeling stressed about school and I'd rate it as a ten out of ten. I am struggling with catching up on schoolwork, getting along with people, and enjoying my time at school.
I'm feeling very intense emotions and it hurts to smile. My energy levels are extremely low, making me feel weak, tired, and consistently depressed. I can recall feeling this way as recently as last night.
I received a phone call from a friend who told me that another friend didn't want me to come out with them that night. After the call, I went to my room feeling really depressed, thinking that I was useless and had no friends.
Recently, I've been feeling like a burden, as if everyone hates me, and I've been extremely lonely. However, last weekend I experienced some happiness and excitement.
I went shopping with my friends and we went to eat at McDonald's and we had really a good fun. It was great. I was really grateful that I got friends like that and planning my evening out. 'We're going to a club afterwards,' I say.
I have been experiencing different feelings lately, especially feeling low and down. It's a bad feeling that makes me angry when I'm depressed.
My mood was about a nine out of ten at that time. The counsellor asked me to write down all my thoughts going through my head in a diary. I said it looks a bit difficult but I'd be able to do it.
This week I had three low moments and a big argument with my mom. Writing in my diary makes the feelings even worse.
I have been trying to do the homework you assigned, but it's quite difficult for me. However, I am trying to think of these thoughts without believing.
I felt really hyperactive and... really pleased and, uh, sort of feeling, well, and I didn't feel low anymore. I had loads of energy, a warm, pleasant feeling, and the thoughts going through my head were about my friends and the future, generally positive thoughts.
Lately, I've been feeling down and low, having negative thoughts about myself and my future. I think I'm useless, hopeless, and that I'll never have any friends. I also feel like everyone is ignoring me and nobody wants to go out with me.
I used to keep a diary when I was younger, but my sisters always read it. I haven't kept one in a while.
I have been feeling a lot better recently, and not depressed. Keeping a diary has helped me recall and sort out my emotions. The work we did on my thoughts and beliefs, especially the tables, has also been very helpful.
I've been worried about the possibility of needing surgery and how it would affect my tightly scheduled work life. I'm concerned about finding someone to cover for me and managing other situations during my recovery.
I know that things can work out easily, but I still let my thoughts take over. It's a bit distracting for me to plan ahead and try to figure out how I'll handle situations if certain contingencies arise. At the same time, I know it's kind of fruitless because it will work if it comes to that. I have a couple of days to wait to find out if it's going to.
I describe it as a creeping in effect. I'm having trouble concentrating on the matters at hand from moment to moment, but it does bring me some relief to think about how I would handle the different details. To be honest, I pretty well have planned out what I need to do in case something occurs, but I still find myself continuously preoccupied with it.
I guess it may be, but it just occurred to me that one of the things I'm doing in that process...
I attended the seminar for newly divorced people that we discussed during our last session, but I didn't stay because I was distracted. I found out last week that I had some polyps in my colon and had them removed. Now, I'm waiting for the biopsy results.
I've been feeling worried about a health issue, even though the doctor told me it doesn't appear to be serious. I get easily distracted and preoccupied with this, especially because my brother had prostate cancer a year ago.
I recently learned that someone close to me had colon cancer and had to go through surgery and treatments. Now they are doing okay, but it made me worried about my own health, even though there isn't much history of cancer in my family. I'm concerned that the polyps found during a test might not be benign, but cancerous.
I think there's a part of me that feels anxious when I'm waiting for something that's out of my control. I don't wait very well, and I want the answer right away.
I often get overwhelmed by thoughts during daily activities and find it difficult to focus. I keep thinking about various things and want to remember them.
Lately, I've been struggling with intrusive thoughts during my day, and it's been hard for me to focus. I try jotting down my ideas and organizing them, but the thoughts still intrude. I've even attempted the thought stopping method after jotting down these thoughts, but it's just not working for me.
Lately, I've been doing things in a very haphazard fashion, which is causing some disturbance in my life. I'm thinking that if I set aside some time to do proper planning, maybe that would help to reduce the invasiveness I'm experiencing.
I have been struggling with disorganized thoughts and it has been affecting various aspects of my life. I think setting aside specific time to think about these things and writing them down could help me organize my thoughts better. I've done this before in other situations and it seemed to work.
I have a habit of turning on the radio and listening to a sports show every morning while getting ready and eating breakfast. I think it might be a good idea to change that, turn it off, and have more quiet time and planning time.
I feel like people don't listen to me and it makes me feel like a lesser person. Logically, I know it doesn't make me lesser, but I still feel that way. How does my inability to control people or make them listen to me when I'm right affect my self-worth?
I believe I'm a totally inefficient person because I screw up with people, work, and friends. It makes me feel rotten.
I have a control issue. I like to control everybody and what they do.
I feel really pissed off when I can't control others and what they think.
I feel like I'm not good enough because I can't control my friends or make them change their behavior, even though I believe that if they really cared about me, they would do what I want them to do to make me happy.
I feel really bad about myself for letting others control me and not reacting well. I'm putting myself down and it feels like a double whammy. When I imagine a situation where I'm out of control and things are getting worse, it makes me angry.
I feel very angry and out of control, like I can't control the situation or people around me. When I try to change my image, I still feel frustrated and annoyed, but I realize it's not about me personally, it's about my behavior.
I agreed to practice rational emotive imagery every day for 30 days, and the counsellor recommended using activities I enjoy, like playing with my dogs, as a reward for completing the exercise. He also suggested using an unpleasant task, such as cleaning up dog poop, as a consequence if I miss a day.
As a patient, I feel like we have covered everything important in our conversation and I don't think there's anything we may have omitted. I am ready to work on it. Do you have any more advice or questions for me before we end the session?
I feel overwhelmed by my current environment and think that moving out of the state to a place with no gangs would help me focus and not worry about my safety.
I had a funny thought about switching outfits with my counsellor and even imagined them wearing my outfit.
I'm worried that I wouldn't look good in a certain type of clothing because it's not my style.
I feel like people have misconceptions about me because of the way I dress.
Recently, I noticed that my style of dressing is quite different from others around me, and I'm starting to feel self-conscious about it.
I was in a situation where I was swinging something at myself and dodging it. It was kind of a stupid reason. Later, it fell out of my hands and we agreed not to use weapons with each other. But the decision didn't really come out as intended.
It was just, just ceased and then, ah, the other fights were down too, after that incident, there was, just never used weapons. We talked some about, ah, what got me into gang stuff. And, uhm, and then what kinda got me out of it. Even though I'm not totally officially out.
I used to be involved in some negative activities because of the neighborhood I lived in and my style of dressing, which was a bit gang-related. I believe that getting out of the neighborhood and changing my appearance would help me get out of that situation.
I've been struggling with the fact that no matter which neighborhood I live in, I will always encounter certain challenges, as there are so many different types of communities out there.
I learned that I shouldn't take mistakes or stupid stuff too hard, and I shouldn't stoop to others' levels. I should think before I do everything and say something, and have more confidence in myself.
I've had some difficulty believing in my self-worth, and I tend to think I'm stupid.
I don't know if my friend's behavior is due to his needs or if he just doesn’t understand what I may have asked. I'm very critical of myself, and I often ask him if I'm saying something clearly. Recently, I've experienced some improvement as I've started to think aloud and show my first drafts of thoughts without confusing them as my final opinion.
I feel frustrated because my partner seems to tune me out during important conversations. He doesn't directly tell me that he doesn't want to deal with the issue at hand, but instead tries to convince me that he's engaged when he's not. Most of the times, he says he needs to think and will never come back to share his thoughts.
I am concerned about my friend who seems to be overspending without considering our financial situation. I observed him doing it recently but couldn't recall the specifics. I want to help him negotiate and handle financial situations better. What should I do?
I manage the money in our relationship, and when I feel anxious, I ask my partner not to try to erase or fix my feelings, so that I know they understand where I'm coming from. Sometimes it works and we're able to communicate, but other times I might become upset.
I want to be able to focus on my own needs instead of constantly worrying about what he is doing.
I found a recent session with Alan very useful in understanding our communication issues. Often, Alan doesn't concentrate on what he's saying and is already thinking about what he's going to say next. This leads to him saying one thing when he means another. I take things literally and get confused, which causes arguments because he doesn't want to take responsibility for what he said.
You know, my partner and I argue over petty things, and it becomes monumental because it happens so often. When we're busy, we just try to communicate the essentials, but often that's not enough. We work and live together, and our arguments involve both personal and work-related issues.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed at work, and I'm not sure if I'm keeping up with all the tasks and responsibilities. For example, today, my coworker Alan was discussing a job we're doing tomorrow. I had to ask him what exactly we're doing for this lady, even though it's a job we did in the spring and she postponed it till fall. I feel like I can't keep track of everything going on.
My partner and I have been together for 12 years, and we have a landscaping business together. We contacted this facility because we felt we needed counseling due to the stressful times we're experiencing in our business.
I've been very busy lately with no time for relaxation or recreation. My partner Alan and I have gone through couples counseling before, but we realized we needed individual help. Now, Alan thinks we should try couples counseling again.
My partner and I were going through a rough patch, dealing with a lot of conflicts and stress in our relationship. We thought about going to couples counseling, but it wasn't available until fall. However, our relationship has improved since then, and we decided to come in for an interview anyway. I think our main issue is communication, either not enough of it or it not being clear.
I have been attending couples counseling with my partner to improve our communication and understanding of each other. We've been doing communication exercises where our counselor mediates, listens to what I say, and has my partner repeat it back to me. I don't feel like there's anything pressing we need to resolve, but I thought this would be beneficial for our relationship.
I remember when we first saw a counselor, I was excited. I thought it was going to be a lot of fun, because it was something we're doing just for us. However, Alan was dreading it and thought I didn't have any idea what I was getting into. Alan was more resistant and had a lot of secrets.
I've told my friend multiple times about our communication difficulties, and I think he's aware of how I feel and how I perceive this situation. However, I believe he's impatient with me for not just understanding what he means. He seems to expect me to understand his ways and fill in the blanks.
I have communication issues with a person who seems to be mildly amused by it and gets frustrated and angry. They think I'm just being a stickler for using the right words, but that's not the case. Essentially, we always want the same thing.
We go about it in completely different ways, but with our work, we both have the same vision in what we should do. But I can’t illustrate that you've asked.
I feel frustrated because Alan isn't decisive and just keeps thinking out loud. When I ask him what he wants to do, he lists all the options but never tells me his preference. I already know the options and just want to know where he stands.
My partner and I have been together for 12 or 13 years, and I think we have a great relationship. I don’t feel like it’s a struggle other than one minor issue. I told my friend Alan when he first started talking about this, I don’t really know why we're here for, and I hope we're not wasting other people's time. I don’t feel like anything is broken that needs fixing.
I just think it's a good maintenance for our relationship. Overall, I think we have a wonderful relationship.
I am not sure about the details, but I know my partner, Alan, was angry recently. Alan often tells me that when I'm angry, he feels responsible and thinks I'm pinning it on him. I just express my anger and get over it, but it makes Alan nervous, and he always says he expects more issues like his father.
When I'm angry, I just want to fly off the handle, get it out of my system, and be done with it. I've probably done this several times in the past. I think the person I'm angry at doesn't pay attention and tends to play these same old routines whenever he hears tension in my voice.
I've been feeling a lot of tension lately and I'm having trouble relaxing.
I've been struggling with my relationship, and we've had incidents where I become upset but don't want my partner to solve the issue or take it personally. I'm trying to focus on these incidents and not avoid them.
I feel like I'm at a stage where I'm open to adding new suggestions to improve my situation, even if things aren't completely broken.
As a patient, I recently had a conversation with my counselor, Dr. James C. Coyne. He was considering talking to someone about my situation. Although we didn't discuss specific topics, he mentioned possibly proposing some episodes for us to look for and collect as opportunities to make improvements in my life.
I was talking to my friend about an example of my mother's behavior. I got distracted and lost track of what I was saying, but my friend said he would think about it. I'm not sure if he actually will, and I think he might feel overwhelmed when he needs to reflect on something.
I feel like there might be some unresolved issues from my past, but I'm not sure if I should try to address them or just let them be. I don't know if they will ever come up again.
My friend sometimes corrects the way I talk to him, and I think he trusts me well. Our relationship is very good otherwise, and this issue doesn't seem monumental, so he doesn't want to bother with it.
I think my most pressing problem is that I am too short-tempered, especially with people I'm close to, like my partner and my mother. I find I'm less tolerant of things in recent years. I just want to make decisions and move on, and I get short-tempered when I have to dwell on difficult things.
I resent that my partner's condition interferes with my relationship and I feel like there is nothing I can do. Sometimes, I become short tempered because of this situation.
I'm struggling to get over something that happened, and it gets even more difficult when I run into the person involved at work. I wish I could avoid him, but it doesn't work like that and he just catches me by surprise.
I have been feeling really upset and angry lately, especially at work where I'm supposed to be professional. People have been noticing my mood and keeping their distance, which makes it even harder for me.
I want to forgive him and move on, but I just can't. I'm not ready yet. Other people keep telling me to let go, but it's too much for me right now. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being ready to let go, I would be between a 2 or 3.
I'm having a really hard time dealing with the betrayal from someone I trusted. It's painful and I don't know how to manage this pain when it comes up.
I've recently realized that I know myself well enough to know that I need some practice in certain areas of my life. I tried something new recently and it feels easier now.
I feel calmer and more relaxed, but I am still worried about running into him at work and not always being prepared. I am willing to try out the coping strategy you suggested, which involves taking a few breaths and picturing a big puppy coming out from my heart.
As the patient, I find it difficult to practice patience in painful situations, and I get easily irritated by other people.
I have this issue at work where someone always leaves a coffee cup on my table when they walk past. It's annoying because I'm the one who always has to clean it.
I'm a little bit down because I've been diagnosed with crumpletone syndrome. The numbness in my hands is very real and it's affecting my ability to do things I used to do. It comes from too much time on the computer and a genetic predisposition because of an extra cervical rib. I wake up in the middle of the night with tingling, hurting hands, and my dad had the same issue. He had an operation, but it led to aggravated hands.
I've been through a tough experience, which I prefer not to describe, and I hope no one has to go through it. I've learned a lot from it, and now I understand why others might feel the same way when facing a similar situation.
As a patient, I have experienced trauma and it seems difficult for me to share or deal with the feelings related to it. I sometimes feel that I am not emotionally ready to face it and discuss it with others.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed in my relationships and struggling to find balance. I feel like I need guidance on how to set a healthy pace and avoid rushing into too many actions with others.
I am at the final stage of my dissertation where I need to make some minor corrections and follow the university's specific format, but I find it frustrating and unnecessary because my content has been approved and signed off by the department and graduate school.
I am in the final stage of my dissertation and I'm running into a lot of university bureaucracy and specific requirements that are time-consuming and resource-intensive. I need to spend a lot of time in front of the computer and deal with specific formatting and printing details. This whole process is leaving me feeling frustrated and sometimes a little angry.
I just feel like I can't answer some questions, and I think a part of me is trying to protect myself from certain feelings.
I've worked with a lot of individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and I've been in situations like this, which has helped me get a better understanding of the issues and difficulties involved. I appreciate and feel honored by what people share in these situations.
During a previous session, I found the process helpful and useful, but I'm not sure if I was ready to open up completely. I didn't interpret any part as being more or less helpful, but I was wondering if you think you could have pushed me too far?
I've been trying to deal with something in my own way, and also professionally, in a specific setting. However, I don't feel off-centered or anything like that. It's more about my own agenda and my personal growth.
I am worried about how much I am going to put myself back in that position again...
I find that life is full of challenges and experiences, and many times, I can't understand why but I can learn to accept it and live and do the best that I can. I try to be an optimist and look for the positive.
I often feel like life isn't fair and agree with what Jimmy Carter said. I think that chances affect each of us differently and sometimes it's just hard to accept.
I've been experiencing symptoms of an illness similar to what my father had, which might be genetic. I think stress and our high-strung personalities contribute to it, too. It affects my hands and makes it hard for me to work, especially when I'm writing or using the computer. It can make me feel sad and even angry sometimes, like 'why me?' and it's frustrating when I'm just trying to do what I'm supposed to do.
I'm handling my mixed emotions of love and anger by continuing to work on the computer as much as I can. Sometimes, I resent sitting on the computer and there are other things I enjoy. I just want to use what I have left in my hands. I probably need to think about this more and try to face my issues as everyone goes through tough experiences in life.
I find that I can speak very academically about my past experiences, but I don't want to go back and really experience those emotions again. I know they exist and I have to deal with them, but I try to avoid it. I think this might be due to my own values and acculturation.
I feel like I need to maintain a certain amount of control in my life, and letting go of that control to share some of my feelings and experiences can be difficult for me.
I found the listening sequences effective when we began to talk more about the specifics of my situation. I noticed I was closing up and becoming more tight, as it opened a vulnerable part of me due to the intense volatility of the situation. It could have gone in any direction, with people getting hurt, including myself and the individual holding the hostage.
I'm struggling with a difficult relationship, and I'm considering just ending it. I've given a lot in trying to have a positive interaction, but it doesn't seem to work, and I can't keep taking that kind of abuse. I had a similar situation with my father, which we resolved after a long time, but I worry that my son might not follow the same pattern.
As a patient, I recently realized that I want my son to call me and apologize for some of the things he said. I don't really expect it to happen, but it's what I truly want.
Last week, after our session, I tried your advice and talked to my youngest son who is going through a divorce. I tried to be supportive to him, and I said something that I wanted to say for a long time. At first, I felt good about it, but later, I felt bad, and now I think our relationship is almost irreparable. I don't think we'll talk again.
I felt that our last session went well, but I don't think I gained any insight or got anything out of it. I think I might not be looking for the same thing that you think I should be looking for. I just want some peace of mind regarding my own personal feelings and not much else.
My relationship with my children is distant. They live in different parts of the country and I don't see them that often. I am willing to do whatever it takes to improve the situation, but I am not sure how my relationship with my father has affected me in this regard.
Today, I wanted to follow up on a session we had a week ago about the issue I had with my father and how it affects me. I don't think I got much out of the last session, and I need some clarification and more information. But I feel like our conversations become arguments, and I just want some help to understand my situation better.
I thought our conversation went well, but after I left, I felt empty and like I left something important unexplored. I didn't fully understand it, and that's bothering me. Also, should I call you Norma or Doctor?
I had different expectations for my sons compared to my daughters. I feel good about my daughters and their stable jobs, but I don't feel good about my sons. I want to be able to free myself of the feelings I have about this and accept them unconditionally, but I struggle with that. Talking about it feels okay, but I haven't come to some peace with it yet.
I feel like a failure as a father because my children didn't pick up on my hardworking habits and good values that I learned from my father. Now, they seem to expect me to support them financially, which I'm not thrilled about because my father didn't do that for me. I thought I was a good role model for them, but it appears that I wasn't successful in passing on those values.
I find it very difficult to be terribly open about this, and maybe I need a little bit of prodding to talk about it, but I am willing to talk about it, otherwise I wouldn't be here.
I have been feeling frustrated with my family because I didn't receive any appreciation or reward for the efforts I made to be a good role model and take care of them. I'm afraid that even if I try to have a dialogue with them, it may end up in an angry confrontation, and I don't think I deserve to carry that burden.
I feel like I've given up and it's not a good place to be. I'm worried about discussing my issues with my family, specifically my son, because I'm scared it will only bring up negative feelings.
I feel disappointed because I have expectations for my children, and they don't always meet them. I wish they could just tell me that their shortcomings are not my fault, but I doubt that will happen.
I've been thinking about getting closer to my oldest son, and I think maybe I could possibly do that.
I feel conflicted about my father's parenting style. He was too good to me; he didn't have high expectations for me and didn't push me to accomplish more. Now that I have my own children, it seems like history is repeating, and I'm in the same position as my father was.
I'm struggling with understanding certain aspects of my life, and I'm not at peace with it. I am considering having a conversation with my sons about these issues, but I'm not sure if that would help.
I've been considering drinking alcohol instead of using drugs, but I'm worried if it's okay to say yes to that. The problem is that I think the alcohol might be affecting my work as much as the drugs.
I want to do sports but it might take me a while to organize a club or find someone to do it with. Also, I think I'm very unfit at the moment and my lungs are not in good shape.
I am considering taking up a team sport to improve my fitness and enhance my relationship with coworkers. I think I could start by going for a walk with someone from work two nights a week and staying late at the office one night a week, which might benefit my relationship with my boss.
I normally get stoned before I go there.
I've been thinking about staying with my sister temporarily to avoid smoking. I could also visit her or other friends who don't smoke once a week. I was also considering going out with my coworkers who don't smoke for coffee or dinner. I think going to a movie could be a way to distract myself from smoking too. What do you think?
I have been feeling overwhelmed with my routine and it's primarily linked to coming home from work. I am thinking of taking some time off work and going away for a while to break the pattern.
I usually take leave with my partner, David, and we go away to smoke a lot. The therapist has given me a list of eight things, but I'm not sure which ones to focus on or eliminate.
I started using drugs and alcohol during my teenage years, mostly on weekends, but it became more of a habit when I was 18 and started University. I was studying hard and feeling stressed, and found that these substances helped me relax and sleep at night. I have generally been an anxious person, and this has worked for me until recently. However, now it doesn't relax me as much as it used to and I'm not having a good time anymore.
Lately, I feel uncomfortable whether I smoke or don't smoke and it's affecting my life. On top of that, I've been questioning if my current job as a computer programmer is what I really want to do with my life.
I've been struggling to concentrate at work and my boyfriend thinks it's because of my frequent marijuana usage. We've been together for about five years.
I feel like my smoking has improved a lot and is now mostly restricted to the weekends. I occasionally still smoke during the week, but it feels more like my choice, and I don't feel like I have to have a cigarette anymore.
I accomplished my goal of feeling like I can choose, and my partner David is very supportive even though he still smokes a lot. I was worried about our relationship since I didn't want to come home every night to him and a bunch of people smoking, but he's been respectful and it's helped our relationship.
Well, my partner and I are now talking about having a baby within the next few years. We used to discuss it only theoretically, but now it feels more serious and concrete.
I have been trying to reduce my cannabis use and my partner has been supportive, but I felt uptight about not smoking recently. That caused some issues and although I've tried using the breathing strategies you taught me, it's still difficult. It's been two years since I've had three days with such little cannabis use.
I couldn't believe it when I didn't smoke that day. It made me think maybe I just need to stay out late every night because I kinda came home and I was like well it's too late to have a, I just wanted to go to bed, you know? I just didn't wanna think about anything and I, you know, just thought well maybe I just need to stay out late every night.
I have never seen a counselor before, and I am curious about the confidentiality of the information that I share during the session.
I recently started growing some plants in my home, but I'm not sure if it's serious or against the law. I am worried about the potential consequences.
I'm here because of my cannabis use. I am 28 years old, and I've been using it fairly heavily for about 10 years.
I've been using drugs since I was in school, and over time, it has become more frequent.
I am struggling with my partner, David, who likes to be in control and I wanted to make a change in my life without needing his support or endorsement. I am also worried about my partner smoking every night and I am having panic attacks. I want to know if I should tell him about my panic attacks.
I don't know why, but I just don't feel like I want to tell my intimate partner about something important I've been carrying on my own.
I've noticed that my smoking habits started to become more prominent about five years ago when I got together with my boyfriend, who is also a heavy smoker. All of his friends smoke as well, so it's been easy for me to get caught up in that lifestyle.
I've noticed that my partner and I only really talk about relationship stuff when we're stoned. He's not much of a talker otherwise, but when he's loosened up, he's more like the kind of man I want him to be. Also, our pattern of use hasn't changed much since I was at university, but now I have more money and we grow our own, so there's an unlimited supply.
I had an argument with David about my substance use, but now that I think about it, I agree with him that it might be a problem. When I was a teenager, my use seemed pretty normal.
I first noticed a shift in my marijuana use when I started University. Previously, I only smoked on weekends, but at Uni, I began smoking every night as well. I generally use a bong at home but use joints when I'm out. The increased smoking was both to help me sleep and before studying.
I have this habit of smoking a joint when I get home to unwind. As the night progresses, I'll have a couple more cones or joints, and before bedtime, I'll have a big smoke because it helps me go to sleep. I used to smoke with a flatmate, but even if they weren't there, I'd still do it.
I came home and had a smoke, but only one. The next night was the first time I saw David, and he was really mad. He said, 'What's going on, you know. You haven't been here.' And I realized that I should've told him.
I should have talked to my partner about my panic attacks, but I was embarrassed. We stopped talking and I started smoking again, feeling like a failure. I don't understand why I can't tell my partner, who is supportive, about my panic attacks.
I remember feeling really distressed when I first started making changes, and I even called myself a failure. But looking back now, I realize that those difficult moments actually helped me to communicate better with David and express my needs. It has helped our relationship in a way.
I remember at the time I felt like it was a huge step back. I couldn't have done it without you.
I'm worried that my partner won't understand my anxiety issues related to cannabis use like you do. Also, work has been really hard lately, and I'm not sure if I can implement the suggested coping strategies.
I think it's a good way for me to minimize the time that I'm going to be home and, therefore, smoking. I feel a bit apprehensive about it, but I really do want to do something about changing what's going on for me.
I went out and came back home, but I didn't smoke at all, even though it wasn't part of the plan. I was so tired and beat at the end of the day, and managed to get a lot of work done.
I went out with a girl from work the other night, and we had dinner. It was good.
As a patient, I would say that I've always been an anxious person, even during my childhood. I found it hard to understand how others could be so relaxed in social situations. Smoking weed made me feel like a normal person because it allowed me to relax and interact with others. It didn't change me, but it made me more relaxed than alcohol ever did.
I used to enjoy how cannabis helped me think and focus on my studies in university, and it allowed me to see humor in simple things. However, now it has the opposite effect. My boyfriend and his friends all smoke, but my coworkers don't, and I've started to wonder why I can't live without it like them.
I've been trying to cut back on smoking during the week. My first smoke is usually when I get home. I've tried drinking more alcohol, which isn't very healthy, but it's a strategy. I've also done sports in the past, like playing netball after work, which stopped me from smoking on those nights. But I don't know if I can do it anymore.
I could go and stay with my sister who doesn't smoke because it's hard for me to go home where David smokes after work and it's not a problem for him.
I've thought about my cannabis use, and part of me wants to continue using but have it work the way it used to. I know I don't want to keep smoking the way I am, and I'm not sure if I want to completely quit. My main problems are with my work, and the fact that it has become a habit. I wish I could choose to use it only at parties or on weekends.
Hi, I'm Mary Jane and I'm feeling very shaky about cutting back on a certain habit during the week. I can't immediately see a solution on how to handle this issue. Can you help me generate some ideas on how to accomplish this, and maybe suggest some things that might work better than others?
I've been struggling with concentration and poor punctuality at work. My boss even mentioned my work performance is slipping. I've been using cannabis for a while and lately, I've started getting anxious when I smoke it. So, I've been drinking more alcohol with just a little cannabis, but now I'm dealing with bad hangovers in the morning.
As a patient, my week has been just okay without any dramatic changes. Last time, I shared the history of my drug use, how it has changed over time, and my growing concerns about it. I have had a long relationship with this drug, and I really want to address my issues related to it.
I've been trying to find ways to break the pattern of going straight home after work, which often leads to me using substances. I have been considering going to my friend's house, arranging activities with colleagues, or watching a movie with my partner.
I've been worried about my work situation, and I've agreed to try two things this week - working late one night and doing something with my coworkers another night. However, I haven't told my partner David about my panic attacks, and I'm not sure how serious he thinks I am about addressing this issue. I feel embarrassed about telling him.
I really like talking to you and I see my life differently since I've been talking to you. I don't want to stop, but it's also confusing. I wouldn't object to adding something else that might help me get where I'm supposed to be.
Lately, I have been feeling overwhelmed because things are closing in. It's mainly my brother-in-law who's getting on my case and keeping me from talking to my sister. On top of that, my mom is sick and that adds more stress to my situation. Additionally, I've been facing some issues at work too as they called me in the office for some errors, which I usually don't make.
I know how important it is to be efficient, and ever since we first met, you've pointed that out. However, I recently made an error and it just doesn't fit with who I am. I have enjoyed talking with you and I've learned a lot, but I think we might need to add some additional strategies or options. What do you think?
I'm not feeling like before. I think things in my life are more out of control now, but I'm not sure if it's because of our sessions or just my life. Before coming here, I wasn't thinking about things the way I've started thinking about them now.
I've been feeling down lately, and my score started at 34 in the first visit, but now it's around 15. It has been going up and down a bit. I don't want these feelings, but it seems like they won't completely go away.
I've been seeing a therapist for a while now, and I've told them that I feel like things are closing in on me. We had agreed on a one-month period initially but later extended it. Regardless of our sessions, I still feel overwhelmed. Now, my counsellor is suggesting exploring other options or adding more resources to our current therapy.
I was at a birthday party and having a good time. Afterwards, I got arrested for no reason. It happened in a part of town where I normally don't hang out, and I think it might be because of my dreadlocks.
I think it's the dreads, you know, it's like, close to Wilmette area. They don't understand and they're a little sketchy. They're looking for people who don't quite fit in, and I'm too urban. They don't like coming into Chicago.
I was having a disagreement with someone and I ended up getting arrested. When I went to court, the judge took the police officer's side, like they always do, and I don't know what to think anymore.
I don't really expect anything new to happen in my life. I just feel like I have to come and talk to someone like you, but overall, things are good for me.
I have friends, and we hang out. I am working, and I always make sure to be on time at my job. Despite a small issue, I feel like things are going quite well in my life.
Well, I'm not really sure why they would have me come here, but I had a night out with some friends.
I went home after having a few drinks and got pulled over by an officer who had a chip on his shoulder. They wanted to give me a Breathalyzer, and he said I was drunk, but that's not the case.
I had all this food at a birthday party. It was just a night out with friends, you know. It wasn't my birthday, though.
I went to a friend's birthday party, and after the party ended I went home because I had to work the next morning. While going home, I made a left turn.
I was driving during the yellow part of the traffic light and got pulled over by a cop. He started asking me questions, and I tried to be nice, just like I'm being nice to you right now. However, he got all upset.
I go to court because my partner gets upset and claims that I was drunk.
I'm not sure if this feedback process is something that happens regularly, and I'm wondering if the counsellor felt that they understood and respected me during our conversation. I'm also curious if they think their approach was a good fit for me.
I've been learning about a new technique and recently completed an assessment. The results show that my score is right below the dotted line on the graph.
I was showing the counsellor my SRS score, which is below the dotted line.
I've been told to come and talk to a counsellor, and although nobody mentioned it directly, I think they believe I have a drinking problem. However, I can assure you that I don't drink that much. I'm here to satisfy the court's requirements and get this issue out of the way.
I'm worried about people not believing me regarding the reports I write. They might think things are not as I say.
I feel like the people around me see me at a much lower level than I see myself. They think I need to be in a certain place and go through a process that I don't think is necessary. I just want to get this done and move on.
I feel like people around me just don't understand me. I have friends and go to parties just like everyone else, but for some reason, they don't see me the way I see myself. I really want them to know who I truly am, but I don't know how to make them see things from my perspective.
As a patient, I agreed to let the counsellor know if I start feeling uncomfortable during our sessions. I also expressed my desire to resolve my issues as quickly as possible.
I've had around three or four sessions and I'd like to schedule more weekly sessions so we can be done within a month.
I feel like things are closing in on me, and my situation is getting worse.
Lately, I've been feeling more affected and sensitive to things, it's like they bother me a lot easier than before.
I feel like the issue is usually not with small things but rather larger ones that go wrong. The main point I'm trying to make is that I have the same amount of education as you and I want you to acknowledge that I'm smart too. Is there anything you would suggest to help me feel more respected?
I feel like during our last session, you were talking down to me and maybe not considering that I already understand some things about the forms and the visit. I don't like having to explain myself constantly.
I just don't know. That's why I'm asking.
I feel a bit on the outside, and I'm really grateful for a chance to learn, grow, and expand. But, I want to make sure that I don't make others uncomfortable and that my thoughts don't come across in a negative way. How can I ensure this?
I have experienced multiple situations where it feels like people don't understand me or they think of me in a way that doesn't fit with my perception and what I know about myself.
I have been friends with Deanna since intermediate school and she constantly makes me feel important and cared for. When I'm with Edward, however, I often feel unsure and not trusting of him, making me afraid to share my thoughts with him.
I've been feeling down lately, but not all the time. It mainly happens when I'm around my family, who I can't avoid interacting with. My partner, Edward, hasn't been around them too much.
I am afraid that my friend Edward will see how I am treated and what's going on, just like how my previous friend Deanna did. But with Deanna, it just happened, and I didn't have control over it. Now I have control, and I guess that's what makes me hesitate with Edward.
I recently did something unintentional that affected one of my relationships. It wasn't on purpose; it just happened by accident. Deanna is probably the only person it really happened with and knows or saw first-hand.
I've been with my partner Edward for a year, and sometimes I feel like I matter to him, but there are times when I doubt whether my thoughts and feelings would matter to him if I really opened up. It's scary to think about the possible negative outcomes. I want to know if this is a healthy relationship and whether I should see a future with him.
I want to be myself in my relationship with him, but I don't know how to do that without being scared. I've been scared so much in my life, especially growing up, and it's really uncomfortable.
I guess I could tell him like, I just, I wonder if it'll matter, you know, if he'll want to do what I want to do. If my, you know, if he'll even think it's important, what I'm saying or what decision I make. Are you going to ignore the decision? Because I have been ignored by everyone. I mean my family in particular. My older sister always treated me really badly and made me feel like I didn't matter. I'm scared at how you'll react, like my mom, who acted like it didn't happen.
I guess I'm just scared that if I tell you, you'll tell me I won't, I don't matter. I'm afraid of your response sometimes. I'm afraid it's gonna, you're gonna respond just like my mom and my sister have toward me. I guess I just need to believe that. And I don't, I don't know if I can do it right this second. But I mean, I can try.
I'm struggling with being myself in my relationship. I'm scared of how my partner will react if he gets to know the real me. I can't seem to accept that he does care for me and that it would be okay. I'm worried that if he knows the real me, he'll leave and won't like me anymore.
In my friendship with Deanna, I feel like I can be myself. She's known me forever and I enjoy spending time with her. I feel good about myself when I'm with her. I haven't shared everything that happened with my family in great detail, but she knows enough to get a sense of what happened.
I don't know if it was so much a decision as, you know, she, you know, she did come over to my house once, and we had to pick something up for school. And she saw how Michelle treated me, and she asked me about it. It wasn't something I could really not say. I mean you can't, I couldn't pretend it didn't happen. I could with everybody else. It was scary, and I was embarrassed that she knew.
I am currently in my second major relationship, and I often let my partner decide on things. This has happened before in past relationships, with family and friends as well.
I guess I just don't really, sometimes I just don't tell him because I don't think he'll care or it won't matter. I think it might be because of my past, where I felt like I didn't matter a lot in my family, like it didn't matter what I wanted, or what I needed. I'm one of six kids and I'm the third oldest.
I am the middle child in my family. My older sisters were always getting into trouble, heavily involved in drugs and alcohol. My parents didn't pay much attention to me because I was the quiet, good one and they probably thought I didn't need as much attention.
I've been with my boyfriend, Edward, for a year and everything was great at the beginning. But lately, we've been fighting more and he's always frustrated. The last time we fought was when we were going out to eat and he wanted my opinion on where to go. I told him it didn't matter, and he got upset, saying I never tell him what I want to do.
My boyfriend says I don't tell him what I want and it bothers him that I'm not open. We've been together for a year and this issue has possibly gotten worse or it just bothers him more now. He wants me to also do things that I want to do, not just everything he wants. Sometimes, I feel like I do everything he wants and don't do what I want to do.
I faced a difficult situation where my older sisters, Michelle and Samantha, sided against me. I feel like they were trying to protect themselves from becoming targets too.
I had a difficult environment growing up, with my dad not being there and my mom not believing me when I tried telling her about what was going on. I felt like I didn't matter, which affected my relationships outside of home too. I had some friends, but I was never really close to anyone and couldn't bring them home or tell them about my issues.
I couldn't bring friends home because I didn't want them to see how my family, especially my sister, treated me. I feel like who I am doesn't matter and I'm unlovable.
I'm feeling a mix of emotions where sometimes I feel like I matter and sometimes I don't. I think I can jot down my thoughts and identify those times.
As a patient, I feel the need to protect my younger siblings because they didn't deserve to be treated badly. I want to talk about my relationship with Edward, who I met in high school when we both worked at Wendy's in the mall.
I've been dating this guy for about a year. We knew each other for two years as friends before, and we have a good connection. Lately, I've been feeling uncertain about his feelings towards me because even though he cares deeply for his friends, I'm not sure if it's the same for me. He's very interested in my opinions and wants me to share more of them, but I'm afraid of being myself and he won't like me anymore.
I just don't know how to let him in without, I don't want to be, it's hard to be vulnerable. I mean I was for so long.
I'm struggling with trusting my partner enough to share traumatic experiences with him. I'm afraid of his reaction, even though I hope he would respond well. I don't know what it would take for me to trust him in that way.
I guess, maybe I'd have to tell him about it first because Michelle like, paints herself differently around other people. I mean she doesn't treat everyone this way. It's me. Sometimes I wonder, what did I do? What was wrong with me, to make me the target?
I'm worried that if I tell him about the situation, he might not believe me, and I can't guarantee that he'll see her doing that either. I don't even know where to start explaining the situation to him.
I am Angelica, and I have a complex relationship with my siblings. My younger sister and I are still working on building a good relationship. I mentioned my friend Edward, who cares about everyone and makes them feel like they matter. I think if he witnessed me being treated poorly, he would be upset for me.
I'm worried that my friend might not support me if I tell him about someone treating me poorly, even though he's supportive of others in similar situations. I sometimes feel like I don't matter as much as everyone else, and I fear he might dismiss my feelings like my mom did in the past.
I'm worried that if my mom reacts negatively to me, then my friend will too because she's my mother. But he's not like my mom, and I can't trust that I matter to him. I don't know what it would take for me to feel like I matter to him.
I've struggled to develop close friendships and find it difficult to open up to people about my past. I've had one or two friends who I've shared some information with, but not in detail. I am in a relationship with someone who cares deeply about others, but I worry that if he truly knows my past, he may see me differently.
I never received any validation from my parents about the issues I faced growing up. My mother would dismiss my feelings and make it seem like everything was my fault. This has now made it difficult for me to trust people and build relationships.
I have some fears regarding my friend Edward, but I haven't really talked to my other friend about it. I guess I'm scared.
I had a difficult time growing up with unsupportive parents and siblings. I had to develop strategies to protect myself, but now I don't know how to turn it off. I recently talked about this with a counsellor, and it felt kind of good to share it.
Recently, there have been times when I feel like I matter more to my partner Edward and other times when I question whether I do. I have never kept any journal about my feelings. Can you suggest something to help me with this situation?
I am feeling frustrated and not particularly happy with where I am right now in life.
I'd feel better about myself and would feel like I'm doing something more challenging and interesting if the current situation changes.
I'm interested in getting into a counseling program, and I wonder what is required and the kind of time commitment involved.
I'm looking for a suitable counseling program and I am not sure which aspect of counseling I should focus on. Can you help me figure out which program would be best for me?
I think it was helpful to get some specific information because you have to start some place and, with good information, someone telling you, giving you some direction, it really helps you to focus on what needs to be done.
I felt encouraged by what you said about me seeming to like relationships and that being a critical factor in counseling. This gave me confidence that I might actually be able to do this, since relationships are important to me.
Recently, I've been having difficulties maintaining healthy relationships with my teachers and coworkers. This has been affecting my work and extracurricular activities like swimming.
I've been considering using my relationship skills in counseling, and I find the idea of working with colleagues and kids really impressive. But I'm not sure what to do next.
I feel like we've had a lot of discussions, but I'm still not sure what I should actually do. I need a specific commitment or action to take.
It feels kind of selfish, and it feels like the relationship isn't going to work, particularly if he can't be supportive in this area that I think is important.
I'm feeling a bit confused about my relationship with Bo, and I'm finding it difficult to decide whether I should leave something comfortable and move on to something new. Change is always hard, but I want to grow and try different things.
Lately, I've been feeling like I just have to take a risk, even though it's difficult for me to do that.
I've thought about it and I feel like it's time, you know, I can't do it later. It's gonna be time now and now is the time, not later.
I really enjoy the work I'm doing right now, especially the part of the job where I get to interact with kids and teachers. I feel like I'm a caring individual who genuinely wants to be involved with people.
As a patient, I'd like to have more information about the process of counseling, graduate school, and vocational opportunities. I am not sure where to start and need guidance to make the right decisions.
I am imagining myself five years from now in a job that I might like, and the first thing that comes across my mind is I am sitting in my office, talking to people and I'm not outside on the field dealing with 40 kids, 30 kids or whatever.
I'm in an office, talking maybe to one student, or maybe a group of students, maybe even a group of students, talking to them about college, just going to school or going to college or jobs... I'm feeling calm and relaxed.
I really enjoy teaching swimming and putting together water ballet. I love when the kids are working together, and this is about the only thing I like about the job. It's fun when we develop ideas and create something together, like the music.
I teach exercise class every day and soccer skills, basketball skills, but I'm not really enjoying it. It's pretty boring and I'm starting to wonder if this is the place that I should be.
Lately, I have been experiencing a mix of excitement and boredom, which has led me to search for new directions. There's a teacher and another counselor at school whose work I admire, and they have been an inspiration to me.
I think I would like to do counseling work like someone I admire. She has been a counselor and I look up to her. The work she does every day, working with people and helping them, seems very interesting and I believe I would find it fulfilling and rewarding.
I like talking to the girls and they seem to come to me and share their experiences. I also like working with my colleagues. But I don't like teaching the skills of basketball, field hockey, or soccer. It's really not my thing.
I guess it's the relationship that I really kind of like, and I think I can be pretty helpful to people. I enjoy having kids coming to me and talking about their problems, and relationships are important to me, even in activities like swimming.
Hi, I've been feeling frustrated with my current situation and I believe that I'd really like to go to school and train to become a counselor.
I'm struggling with dealing with some issues in my life, and I'm not sure how to approach them. Can you give me an example of how to handle something like this?
I think I am pretty committed to that university, and I'd like to explore the programs. I want to go there and talk to some people about the program. I also want to talk to some counselors in the field besides my one friend, to get different perspectives on what it's like and what aspect of counseling should I choose, be it school counseling or mental health counseling.
I am trying to figure out the kind of counseling I want to do and what is required for it. I need to know about the details like sending transcripts and the application process. What are the steps I need to follow?
I've been feeling really good lately and I received a compliment that I would make a great counselor, which made me feel even better.
I have been feeling frustrated because I haven't been able to get into the counseling field. I think it's partly because I've allowed my partner, Bo, to make decisions for me, and I haven't really expressed my feelings about it. I don't usually show much anger or frustration.
I got the sense that I need to focus on myself and my needs. I really do want to follow up and look at this counseling stuff more.
I've been feeling unhappy in my current field, and I have a strong desire to transition into counseling. I believe that making this career change will help me feel better about myself, but I'm still unsure about the decision.
I'm the patient here, and I hope to get some literature from you to follow through with the work we have done in our session together. We've just set another appointment and I'm eager to have something to work on in the meantime.
I'm a little nervous about making this big change in my life, it's scary but I really would like to do it. However, my partner Bo doesn't quite agree with my decision.
I am struggling with balancing my desire to maintain a relationship and my need to be satisfied with my life choices. I'm not sure if this relationship is as important as me being satisfied and deciding what to do with the rest of my life.
I'm feeling a bit unsure about my goals, especially in my current relationship. I could really use some advice on how to figure out what I want and whether it's worth spending my time on.
I'm wondering if going to graduate school to become a counselor is a realistic goal for me. Can I really do this kind of work and am I cut out for it?
I've been looking into different counseling programs at universities nearby, and it seems like there are two with fairly good reputations. However, one is closer to where I live, while the other is farther away. I'm having trouble deciding which one to choose.
I was thinking of going to visit the State University, but my partner discouraged me from going and I didn't end up going there.
I've been feeling unsupported and discouraged by someone I care about regarding my job choices. They seem to think that I should pursue something completely different, like going into business, instead of pursuing further education in my current field.
I am feeling confused and upset because I don't know where he was coming from.
I have been thinking about starting a career in counselling. However, my understanding of the field is quite general, and I need to learn more about the different aspects of counselling before making a decision.
I am considering interviewing counselors for guidance, but I have only interacted with one person so far. I think I need to interview other counselors to see the differences in their approach and advice.
I think I'd like to go to the State University. I believe that it would be great and closer for me. Is it a pretty good program?
I think we've got a good vocational plan, and I'm ready to make some changes in my career. That's about all the issues I want to bring up today.
I thought I could be strong and that my health wouldn't be affected by smoking, but now I'm losing my breath and it's becoming a problem. My girlfriend gets mad at me because of this habit, but on the other hand, my bandmates might think I'm lame if I quit.
I smoke for personal reasons as it relaxes me and because it's tempting. But, there's also a social aspect – I smoke in order to fit in and be included with my friends. I don't want to be an outcast from the group, but I also want to maintain a healthy lifestyle and feel strong.
I've been struggling with my smoking habit, and it's been getting progressively worse. Six months ago, I barely thought about it, but now it's always on my mind. I want to quit for health reasons, and I've noticed some negative side effects. However, it's challenging, especially when everyone in my band smokes, and I feel temptation when they're in front of me.
I have been smoking for a while and lately, I have started experiencing health issues. My girlfriend keeps telling me to quit and that I'll die from it. Just recently, when I was walking up a hill for surfing, I found myself losing my breath and coughing, which I'm pretty sure is due to cigarettes.
I tried quitting smoking for three days and felt kind of accomplished. During those days, I didn't smell like cigarettes, and my girlfriend liked that.
I was trying to quit smoking, and I managed to go without cigarettes for three days. But then I bought a pack at a gas station, and I just kept buying more. It's hard to get back on track once I've fallen off, and I wonder what's the point. I want to quit smoking and feel good again.
I have been feeling down and not confident in myself lately. I think that if I could become more athletic, it would improve my mood and how I feel about myself.
I have been trying to quit smoking but it's been really challenging for me. I don't like the negative comments from my girlfriend and her constant worrying about my health.
I'm struggling to quit smoking and I'm not sure which replacement activities would work. I think having alternatives to smoking could help me reach my goal faster.
I've been trying to quit smoking, but it's quite hard. I've taken some steps, but they haven't been as successful as I'd like. I'm considering having designated non-smoking days or setting up a reward system, but I'm not sure if that will work.
My boyfriend called me and said he loves me and misses me. But, our conversations are never that exciting. I'm concerned about our future together, especially if we move to a small town together.
I've had a lot of disappointment in the past and have been around many bad relationships in my life growing up, including my grandparents. I remember thinking that married people weren't supposed to talk because that's how my family was.
As a patient, my parents were divorced when I was very young and I lived with my grandmother, grandfather, and mom. They didn't talk too much. I don't have a close long-term relationship with my father, and my mother has remarried to a great man with whom she talks.
As the patient, I mentioned that someone I know has a good marriage.
I have Polish descendants and I would like to join a volunteer group that goes to Poland for service projects. I need to pay for the trip, but they provide housing and it is tax deductible.
I'm planning to move to a small town in Poland and I'm about 90% sure about it. I'm looking forward to the excursions and the cultural experiences in the bigger cities.
I'm worried about my relationship with Chris. I'm 90% sure that he will ask me to marry him, but I'm afraid that if I don't, I'll lose him. On the other hand, if I marry him, it might turn out to be a bad marriage. I've thought about spending another three weeks with him to better assess our compatibility.
I've met a nice man, and people keep asking me what's wrong with me since I haven't fully committed to him yet. I've started to think that maybe there's something wrong with me, but I don't really know.
I have been seeing someone since June and we spent time together during the summer. It felt more like a vacation than a real relationship. I am not sure what we actually talk about when we're together or if we have any deep connection.
I saw my boyfriend last summer, and there was a good physical chemistry between us. But when he's gone, I surprisingly don't really miss him and I feel terrible about it.
I know… I know, but it's like I get back in my own routine and my own world and you know if I don't hear from him another week, that's fine. But, sometimes I'm annoyed when he calls, especially if I'm in the middle of something.
I've been working on my master's degree, and I still have a little over a year left before I finish in June of 2001. This degree is really important to me.
I am an educator, currently working as a teacher. I'm considering marrying my partner, but that would mean relocating to his state. I want to continue teaching, but I'm worried about how this change will affect my life.
I'm struggling with the decision to move 650 miles away, get a new job, and move in with my boyfriend who is wonderful to me, but I can't tell if I'm afraid of making a life change or if I just don't want to do it. I'm unsure if I have the capability to make a long-standing commitment.
I don't know if it's just my current situation or if I would be like this with everybody or anybody. I just feel confused and uncertain.
I'm feeling confused about my relationship. My mom initially supported it, but now she's telling me to be cautious. She thinks it's my decision, but I just don't know. I talk to her about it all the time and I keep thinking maybe it's me who has the issue.
I am worried about whether or not I'm commitment-phobic. I feel uncomfortable in certain situations and don't know what to do. Can you please give me some advice?
Lately, I've been feeling a bit anxious about a situation, and it's been troubling me.
I feel bothered because my family is overly close to me, but my husband is not really close with his kids. I don't understand and it's affecting me.
As the patient, I'd like to share that my mother has passed away, and my parents are divorced. I don't think I'm particularly close to them, and I don't talk to them much. I have a good relationship with my dad, but with my siblings, I don't really know.
I've been observing my mom and her new husband, and I think they have a better marriage now. They are gentle and loving towards each other and they work together. But I'm still uncertain about how long love can keep a marriage going, since I've seen many tough ones. Do you think a marriage can last based on love and having things in common?
I'm feeling unsure about my relationship because my mom keeps telling me that my partner and I might not have enough in common.
I'm 35 years old and grew up as an only child in a very protective family. Now I'm working and doing things I like, but my family keeps asking me why I won't get married. Everyone thinks that there's something wrong with me because I'm not pursuing marriage yet.
I am in a long-distance relationship with a wonderful man who wants to get married, but I can't seem to make that commitment. I am also working on my master's degree and my busy schedule is starting to take a toll on our relationship. He says he understands my situation, but I'm not sure. There's constant pressure to make up my mind and make a decision.
I work as a special education teacher in a middle-class neighborhood, and many of my students are very needy. Sometimes, I feel exhausted at the end of the day and I just need some guidance on how to handle this.
I'm in a relationship with a guy who puts a lot of pressure on me. If he doesn't call some week, it's okay with me. I feel like I might not be doing him any good because I'm not planning on making a long-term commitment. I don't know if I should let him go and be with someone who's more suited for him. I feel guilty about this situation and wonder if I'm being selfish.
I know someone who hasn't graduated high school, but he's really skilled with cars and can put them together. He's one of those southern guys who work with cars all the time. He doesn't drink, and he's a very respectful gentleman.
I'm concerned about my partner who is in his 40s and unhappy with his current career. He wants to find a new career, but at his age, he should be thinking about planning for retirement. He believes that if we get married, everything will be fine and he'll be happy. He is needy and doesn't like being alone, but I don't think I can be the sole reason for his happiness.
I am concerned about my current long-distance relationship. I've put my foot down and try to assert myself in the past, but I worry that if we get more serious, my partner could become controlling. This is the first time I've had a relationship where I'm considering a long-term future, as my previous relationships were short and I felt like I was always the one doing all the work.
I'm having some concerns about my partner's past and decisions, and it bothers me. He was married for 22 years before, and he is six years older than me. I really don't understand why it bothers me so much.
I'm in a relationship with this man who's a widower with two grown-up kids, one is 21 and the other is 18. His wife passed away and he was the primary decision-maker in their marriage. So, I think his wife was relatively dependent on him to run the show.
I'm struggling with whether I want this independence I have or if it's just a reason I'm using for not committing to a relationship. My partner is from the south and has different work ethics than me and my family, and that worries me. His attitude towards money and work is more laid-back compared to our fast-paced life in the mid-west.
I feel my life is in order, my house, my car, and I have friends. I don't feel lost or anything, but nobody has told me it's okay to feel this way. Can you help me understand if it's normal?
Sometimes I come home after working with kids all day and feel so happy that it's quiet. I love kids, but if I don't have my own, that's fine. I don't feel a biological need for them. I teach third grade, so I'm around young children all the time.
As a teacher, I build pretty good relationships with the majority of my students. They seem to look up to me as long as I treat them well. Unfortunately, I don't get a lot of parental support from their parents, but the few I have met seem to like me. My school is not very elite.
I feel like people just see that I'm passing up opportunities, but nobody really understands my situation. I feel hesitant about committing to things because I have a strong need for freedom. Am I commitment phobic?
I'm feeling conflicted about my life choices because people around me want me to settle down and focus on having a family and children, but I don't think that's the life I want for myself. I also feel pressure from my partner, who seems to view me as a confident person, even though I have my doubts.
I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately with my work and personal life. It just seems like everything is piling up and I can't find any balance. I'm starting to lose sleep and have trouble focusing during the day. Can you offer any advice on how to manage this stress and find some balance in my life?
I've been in a relationship, but when I'm alone sometimes, I've thought about looking at other people. There was a time when I went out and denied to someone that I have a partner, and I don't know why I did that.
I'm in a relationship with this guy, and he gave me a ring. He wanted me to wear it on my left hand, but I told him I wasn't ready to be engaged. He said that I can keep it as a gift and wear it on my right hand if I want to. I don't feel terrible about not accepting his proposal, but I'm not sure if it's an honest thing to do.
I recently took a diamond ring, and it's pretty, but I wish I hadn't taken it. At the time, I didn't think it was a bad idea, but now I'm regretting my decision.
I was feeling conflicted about my decision at the time because I didn't want to hurt the other person.
I feel like I try to please people and I would be making everyone happy if I followed the path they have planned for me, but I'm not sure if that's what I want. I'm 35 years old and people have known about my unsatisfied relationships, so they want me to settle down.
I love to travel and it's my favorite thing to do. I have been out of the country three times, and it's exciting for me to see exotic places and experience different things. But I usually travel alone.
I usually book a trip and join a tour group overseas because my friends are married or divorced and can't afford to travel. I have no dependents, so it's easier for me. I find it great as I meet new people and have friends when I want them. People feel sorry for me, but I think it's better than having a partner who can ruin the whole trip.
I had a relationship that went horribly wrong, and after that, I decided to give up on relationships and live my life alone. My ex-partner wasn't comfortable with this idea, but I don't consider myself a needy person. I am not desperate to have a child and I am unsure about my biological clock.
I've been thinking about what this guy offers me that I don't have now, and I believe it's companionship. We usually spend every other weekend together because we live 650 miles apart.
I have been in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend - we see each other every two or three weekends. He comes to my place, and we have a wonderful time together. However, I feel a bit uneasy when he leaves on Sunday night.
I felt sad the last time he left, but the time before that, I was glad to see him go and happy to be going to work. It depends on if he's pressuring me; then it's not a good weekend.
I've been struggling with this issue for a while now, and I can't help but wonder if it'll ever get better. Last summer, I had a great trip to Poland, but I'm still not sure if I can fully enjoy life given my current situation.
As a patient, I feel unsure about my partner moving to a small town and leaving their mechanic job in Chicago. I think there's a lot of opportunity for him here as mechanics are in demand and he could potentially make good money.
I feel overwhelmed and uncertain because I have been discovering new aspects to my partner after marriage that I was not aware of before. It seems that we didn't know each other as well as we thought.
As a student with special needs, I'm offered accommodations like taking tests in a separate room and getting extra time on tests if needed. However, I usually feel the pressure to finish when I see others completing their tests. Sometimes the separate room option is available, but it can be complicated and not consistently offered. There are no homework accommodations for me. Can you provide any suggestions?
I am the parent of a child who is struggling with homework and organization. He stays up late doing homework, but then forgets to turn it in. I'm worried that I am failing him because of my own organizational issues.
I've noticed that he's been struggling a lot lately. He has also been held back a grade before, and I'm worried about his progress.
I remember when he held things in a really funny way with a weird grip and he struggled to relax his hand. It was always difficult for him. Recently, he has started in public school in third grade, but some lingering family issues involving his dad are affecting him.
Even though we had already been split up, my son was three when we separated. I think it was the middle of second grade when he went to Harding Elementary School.
As a parent, I observed that my child really enjoyed the routine of going to school, wearing the flexible uniform, and having his little lunch box. But I noticed that he faced some challenges academically, especially when it came to writing skills.
I'm struggling with my son's transition from second grade to third grade. He used to feel good about himself, but now he feels really wrong and discouraged. In his second grade, there were 28 kids, and he was below grade level. He's not used to sitting for long periods of time and he's having trouble adjusting.
I took my son to the emergency room on Saturday morning because he had chest pains for the first time in his life. They thought it was due to a stomach issue. He had spent time with my brother and ate a lot of candy, which he doesn't usually eat. The next morning, he was in tears because of the pain. He was clammy, couldn't breathe well, and his chest hurt.
I am worried about my brother who recently looked really panicked on our way to a family event. He was scared and trying to hold it together for our mom. It was something he was looking forward to, like our sister's graduation and a picnic with our dad and sisters. This has never happened before, and I don't think he gets anxious about seeing our dad. We took him to the emergency room and he had tests done, but they said it might be some kind of medical issue.
I am having an issue with my child who constantly lies, even though they are not always serious lies. He usually does this to get out of doing something or to do something that I've told him he shouldn't do.
As a parent, I'm concerned about my child who is generally well-loved by adults, but there's an issue with him being manipulative and lying. Other adults have noticed this too, but we can't figure out why he does it. When we catch him lying, we talk to him about it and express our lack of trust in his words. This often leads to him not being allowed to do certain things because we don't trust him. I'm not sure how to address this issue.
As a patient, I want to clarify that I have never been involved in any physical fights where someone got really hurt, and I have not bullied, intimidated, or threatened other kids as well. Furthermore, I don't have any problems with stealing.
I'm dealing with a situation where someone close to me often takes advantage of my forgetfulness in a non-aggressive way. It doesn't happen all the time, but it's pretty regular, and it leads to arguments between us. This person seems to be easily annoyed and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around them. They always seem bothered by something.
I am describing my child. He's easy going and very thoughtful. If something bothers him, he wants to figure it out rather than getting angry and resentful. He's not spiteful or vindictive, and he doesn't try to get back at people.
I have a concern about someone close to me. He doesn't seem to annoy people on purpose, and he doesn't do things to intentionally drive me crazy. However, when he does something wrong or faces a bad outcome, sometimes he blames others for it. It's like it's all my fault.
I have a child who often goes the opposite direction and tends to blame others for his mistakes. I would say more than 50 percent of the time, he's putting the blame on someone else.
Over the past few months, my son has been particularly irritable. His eating habits haven't changed, and he doesn't seem slowed down or more agitated than usual. He hasn't expressed feeling badly about himself, feeling worthless, or feeling guilty about anything specific. The only time he feels like it's all his fault is related to his school situation.
Recently, I have noticed my teenager being very irritable over the past few months. He seems discouraged and pessimistic about school, especially moving to the next grade. He also frequently complains about either a stomach ache or a headache, at least once a week.
I was homeschooling my child along with three other kids and another mom. We used to be creative in our teaching methods. My child would learn things, and he knew all the alphabet sounds. He would even sound out the names of things while driving, but I couldn't get him to sit still and read. I would get frustrated but then back off because I didn't want him to hate reading.
I just wanted to share that my son has always been fidgety and very energetic. He would make up songs about the planets and could tell you all about them while walking around or jumping on a pogo stick. He has always played the drums and even tapped on the floor in stores. People say he fidgets, but it's controlled. However, he has never been good at writing and was not an artsy kid who liked to draw. He could hold a pencil in first and second grade, but he was never interested in writing.
I'm concerned about my child's eating habits, and it really worries me. He is in a regular classroom at a music school called Pacific Boychoir Academy. He is very musical and loves singing for hours a day. The school is private, and there is no IEP or special education services.
I had tried to get extra help for my son when he was in public school, but they made it difficult for me. However, he received help from an outside reading specialist that his Godmother paid for. We stopped recently, as he made progress in reading, but he's still not organized regarding homework. I think more extracurricular activities would be better for him than more school-related work.
I would say that the school has been quite accommodating with my requests for a more suitable testing environment for my child. We made the request at the beginning of the year and they were very helpful, but as the year got busier, it seems like they've forgotten to offer him the chance to take the test in the other room.
As a patient, I wanted to know if our session was over, and I found the process a bit strange. I also expressed my appreciation for the counselor's patience.
I am struggling with completing chores and remembering to do tasks without prompting. I also tend to lose things often.
I constantly struggle to find my day-to-day items like my shoes, and I often forget where I put my pencils. I also need a lot of reminders for tasks, or they just don't happen. My teachers say I have a hard time staying in my seat and I tend to wander around the classroom.
I have trouble answering some questions because they don't bother me. For example, my child doesn't stay seated at home and jumps up a lot during meals. At church, he walks around, interacts with others, and stays busy instead of sitting still, and it doesn't bother me.
At school, my child has a hard time. I don't know if the teacher has ever said he's had a hard time sitting, and I don't know if she requires them to sit that long either, but he struggles.
I am really struggling with my focus in school. I'm very creative, but I can't remember what I do at school when I get home. My assignments don't always get turned in, even though I'm not doing it on purpose. My teachers are frustrated and it's affecting my self-esteem. I also have difficulty with homework at home.
I try to keep the homework monitoring as light as possible, but my child needs a lot of prompting to finish it. He doesn't want the monitoring, but without it, he keeps getting up and can't sit still. He's constantly going back and forth, needing drinks of water, and it's becoming a problem.
I have a history of depression, but I'm not currently on medication. I often forget to take it, and the medication I have is probably a year old. I don't know if I've been diagnosed with ADHD, but I feel like I might have it. Managing everything has been a lot for me lately.
I think there might be a history of ADHD in my family. My mother and I were estranged for a while and I notice similarities in our behavior. However, there are no hospitalizations for psychiatric cases in my family, but my brother has struggled with substance abuse.
I'm struggling with setting boundaries and structure for my son. Sometimes, I forget the limits I set and he convinces me to let things slide. This often results in him losing his temper with me about once a week or more.
I'm feeling frustrated because my child only misbehaves with me and not with other adults at school. My child's dad has a history of learning disorder but no known problems with inattention or ADHD. His dad had an eye cancer that led to the removal of his eye, which might be connected to the learning disability.
I've observed that my partner is very focused and driven since his young age, but he comes from a family with a history of substance abuse. His paternal grandfather died of an overdose, and his mother is in recovery. I'm curious if there's any correlation between his family background and his behavior?
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed because of the pressure to take care of my grandparents. I love them, but it's taking an emotional toll on me. What can I do?
I had an evaluation for depression a long time ago when I went to the doctor. My 11-year-old son's name is Noah and he just finished fifth grade.
Well, Noah is amazing. He's really musical and artistic and has a brilliant memory. I stayed home with him for a long time, so he didn't go to nursery school or kindergarten or any of that. I read things that ask questions about kids being overactive, like walking on furniture, but I thought that was just how kids are supposed to be. My primary concern is what prompted me to contact the clinic.
I feel like my son gets easily distracted when I talk to him. He often switches topics while we are talking about something else. Also, he needs constant prompting to get things done or else he'd forget to do things like wearing shoes or completing his homework. I am concerned about his ability to organize himself.
I am always disorganized and running late, and I have a hard time focusing on tasks that require attention, like chores. Also, my martial arts instructor seems to think that I have difficulty paying attention in Taekwondo classes. I wonder if all kids are like this.
I have been noticing some issues with my child's attention in both home and school environments. He is great with physical activities like Taekwondo, but when it comes to mental tasks, he struggles. I've received similar feedback from his tutor as well. I'm concerned about his ability to focus not only on academics but also on other things like chores.
I took my child to a specialist, and they diagnosed him with dyslexia or at least showed signs of it. We tried to get an IEP at school, but they put it off. He's really struggling, and I think he might have combined ADHD as well. It's difficult for him to focus in class because he's so far behind.
I have been experiencing difficulties with disorganization, losing things, and not being able to get through routines. Everyone around me is speaking about complex topics and I find myself getting distracted and spacing out frequently. I wonder if it's just my situation or if there might be an underlying issue.
I feel like my friend knows what's going on most of the time, even in class. It seems like he's always trying to catch up, both with his tasks and understanding everything. But at the same time, he seems to be easily distracted and lost in his thoughts, like he's on Mars. He's a funny and interesting person, but I'm a bit concerned.
I have a concern about my child having issues in the classroom. He tends to be loud and often wants to be the first one to answer questions in a group setting. But I haven't heard any complaints from teachers about him shouting answers in class without raising his hand.
I'm having a hard time with my son, who always seems to be so active and constantly moving. He can't wait his turn when playing games, and even when we're waiting in line at a store, he's always running all over the place, keeping himself entertained physically.
I have observed a kid in situations like playing games or standing in line for movies. He seems to be fine talking with other kids, but he tends to interrupt conversations if he has something to say, or if I'm talking to someone, he will walk up and stand right next to me without considering personal space.
I'm worried about my son's behavior. He has some traits that I think might be inheritable, both biologically and socially. He's been active since a young age and struggles in school. He's likable and socially adept, but his teachers say he's easily distracted and doesn't turn in his work. He's already repeated the fourth grade and was close to being held back in fifth grade.
I often struggle with staying focused and get easily distracted. It's hard for me to stay on task and I make a lot of careless mistakes in my work. For example, I lost many points last year because I didn't follow specific instructions, or I simply forgot to write my full name on the paper.
I have noticed that my child seems to rush through his work and not do it carefully. Additionally, he doesn't seem to listen carefully to his teachers or to me. Sometimes, he even starts singing in the middle of a conversation as if his mind is elsewhere.
I often talk to my friend, and sometimes I ask him questions, but he doesn't even respond because his mind seems to be somewhere else.
I have to constantly remind my family member to do basic tasks like brushing his teeth, showering, and other self-care activities. He often doesn't do any of those things unless I remind him, and how he reacts depends on his mood.
Sometimes I tell my son what to do and he goes 'yes, ma'am,' but other times he snarls at me. I find it hard to discipline him because I'll say something and then forget, and he knows I'm going to forget.
I feel like my child started speaking relatively early in complete sentences. There wasn't a lot of babbling and toddling. It was almost like he was just born grown. He has two older half sisters, but they don't live with us. It's just him and us in the house.
I am having a hard time with standardized testing. I think my scores will be low even though I knew the answers, and it is really frustrating for me.
I had a wonderful delivery with no complications. My baby weighed 6 and a half pounds, and we had a home birth. As an infant, I don't remember any problems, and he wasn't colicky.
I was describing my child to a special ed teacher, and he was a really good baby. He potty trained himself, didn't cause any problems like other kids, and I didn't even have to carry around a diaper bag full of stuff for him. However, he did walk late compared to other kids.
I noticed that someone I know didn't go through the toddling phase when he was learning to walk. He just got up and started walking without any struggle. It seems strange to me.
I have a child who has a really good sense of humor and is intellectually at grade level, but he struggles functionally. He needs prompting to start activities, and he never finishes them on time. Teachers keep him in at lunchtime to try and have him finish homework. What can I do to help him?
I am concerned that my child is not getting the help he needs at school. They don't send schoolwork home, and they only send homework when he doesn't turn it in. He struggles with making connections between school and home, and it's causing him stress.
I have a child who sometimes spends time with friends after school. Our life is quite hectic. He goes to Taekwondo two days a week and can do this on his own by riding his scooter and taking the bus. He also goes to a music school one night a week.
I have a son who sings constantly. It's like he can't help himself. I don't think he has any other repetitive behaviors like handwashing or tapping. He seems to enjoy singing, but I'm not sure if he has any thoughts in his head that bother him or if there is anything else I should know about his behavior.
I feel really self-conscious about the mess in my house, and I think it's affecting my child's social life. He gets invited to other people's houses a lot, even for birthday parties, and the other parents never say he can't come back. But I am worried if it's just me or there might be any issue with him.
I am a student who often feels the need to stand and move around while working in class. I fidget and tap my hands a lot, which sometimes disturbs others. Are most teachers okay with me standing at my desk?
I have noticed that my son squirms in his seat often and seems to be more active compared to his classmates. He tends to run around, climb on things, and even attempts to touch the ceiling while walking down the hall. Is this something I should be concerned about?
I have a child who is always on the go, like the Energizer Bunny, unless he is watching a YouTube video or something that keeps him focused. In those situations, he tends to become hyperfocused. It's either he's hyperfocused or he's all over the place.
I've noticed that my son is somewhat louder than other kids his age. He constantly needs to be reminded to use his inside voice by both me and other people. Whenever he is with a group of kids, I can always hear his voice standing out from the rest.
I think my son has been going through a tough time lately. His irritability started a few months ago, around the same time when he was moved up to the varsity choir at school, which increased his responsibilities and commitments. We have been dealing with a lot of chaos at home, and he started pushing back, saying he's tired and not feeling well.
I'm a parent and I've noticed that my child often complains about stomachaches and headaches before bed, and then doesn't want to go to school in the morning. However, once he gets to school, he seems fine.
My child complains about stomachaches, headaches, and being tired in the mornings when it's time to go to school, but when he gets there he's energetic and playful. He's also been more irritable recently and has gained quite a bit of weight. I'm not sure if he's really sick or just resistant to going to school. Has his compulsive eating habit changed recently?
I am 11 years old and I had to repeat fourth grade at a different school. Now, I'm in fifth grade and about to turn 12. Although I am doing better academically, I still struggle with writing, and I'm not at grade level yet. I am worried that I might not be able to keep up when I enter sixth grade.
I just finished fifth grade and my teachers say that I'm kind of spacey and I often stare off into space. I have been allowed to use an Alpha Smart for keyboarding.
I've noticed that my child doesn't always seem to be paying attention. He drums on everything and acts like the life of the party. When he does tune in, he's always quick with one-liners.
As a patient, my son has been exhibiting a behavior that distracts the whole class. Although he hasn't been rejected by his classmates, I'm still concerned about this issue. On the other hand, socially, he's doing quite well.
I'm worried about my son's sleeping habits. He goes to bed around 10:00 pm, and I have to drag him out of bed at 7:00 am for school. On weekends, he would just keep sleeping if I don't wake him up. Also, he doesn't eat enough vegetables.
I think sometimes I worry that my child eats anxiously, even when he's not really hungry, and it might be because I've stressed him out about school and other things. I'm afraid he's going to become overweight even though he is active, since he can eat a whole package of cheese at once.
I remember my son getting excited about a house just because it had a hook for keys. He's used to me being critical, but I can't tell if he has ADHD or just bad habits. Lately, he's been losing his temper about once a week, often getting frustrated with my critical comments. His tantrums, though, don't last long.
I usually get into arguments with my partner due to either homework or something missing. I get frustrated when my partner can't find something, and then my partner gets frustrated because I'm frustrated with them. This happens about once a week, and we quickly move past it, but we're always butting heads.
I wouldn't say always cause we really do have a good relationship, but that happens a lot and I don't, and I've just been thinking it's like, you know, adolescence kicking in. But yea he does, he does, um. Does he ever argue with other adults? No. So would you say this is happening almost every day and he's really arguing with an angry tone? It's an angry tone.
I don't have any unusual fears, but I prefer not to get shots. I don't freak out when I get them, though. I tend to worry about school and focusing on my work. My worries are usually realistic, like worrying about a test I haven't done well on in the past.
I am a mother and my son is the patient. He tends to worry, especially because he knows I'm going to worry too. He's not generally a worrier though. He gets stomach aches and headaches about once a week. He's very self-conscious about how he looks and how other kids see him. He doesn't usually ask me if he looks good, but he does want to look good.
As a 5-year-old, I had good social skills and was within the normal range of activity for a child my age. I would tell other kids that I wouldn't play with them if they weren't nice. However, I'm not sure if there were any differences in my activity level or ability to get work done as I moved into first grade.
I've been managing my son's behavior through his diet. I noticed that when I gave him protein for breakfast, he behaved better than when he had carbohydrates. However, his behavior is not problematic, and he's really a joy. We often go out with another mother and her son, and I've observed how his diet affects his behavior. He's more active and loud but then crashes and gets grouchy. I think if he was in kindergarten with other kids, he might have been more trouble, but I'm very tuned into him because we spend a lot of time together.
I homeschooled my child until the middle of third grade, when we experienced some family trauma, and I had to start working. That's when I enrolled him in a public school, which was really hard for him.
I was homeschooling my child through a charter that supports homeschool kids. I was also homeschooling another child who was a little older than my own child at the time. So it was the two of them during the homeschooling period.
As a parent of a 5-year-old child, I have noticed that my child has always been really active. I have a unique perspective since I have observed other kids of the same age, and I wouldn't say my child is more active than the rest, but I am wondering if this is something I should be concerned about.
My child constantly interrupts me when I'm talking on the phone, even after I've told him to stop. I have to use a really mean voice to make him stop, which I hate doing.
I am the parent of a young boy, and people often say he talks too much. He's a chatterbox, and it can be problematic at school because he's too chatty with his friends. I don't complain about it a lot, but my son tends to entertain others and requires separation from certain kids to avoid disruptions.
I've been struggling with being inattentive, losing things, disorganization, not listening, not finishing tasks, and being extremely active. This has been a consistent issue in my life, starting from when I began school in second grade. However, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact age because I am homeschooled, and I have a parent who has similar characteristics.
I sometimes struggle to figure out whether my son's messiness is because of me or something he developed on his own. When he was little, his room was always a mess, but so was mine.
I am a parent of a child who recently learned to do some tasks by himself, like buttoning and zipping his clothes without asking for my help. He still seems to be struggling with fine motor skills, but he can use utensils like a knife and fork without any issues. He hasn't undergone any occupational therapy for fine motor skills.
I don't know if my child was actually dyslexic or not, but he read late and we got him a dyslexia teacher. After about a year and a half of teaching, he reads a lot now. I am not sure if people with dyslexia continue to have difficulties with reading or if he is skipping stuff while reading. Also, he was supposed to wear glasses to see the board, but he never wears them and just sits at the front of the room.
I think my son doesn't need glasses because he goes to a small school and doesn't have to see far. He doesn't have any ongoing medical conditions or take regular medications, just an occasional children's Tylenol. His current health is good, but I'm concerned about his sleep habits.
I've noticed that my child was generally easygoing and had good social skills growing up. He did okay in school during his early years, but he's also been somewhat anxious. How do you think his anxiety might have an impact on his social skills?
As a patient, I want to share that my son is in the third grade, which is his first full year at Harding. However, this wasn't due to him repeating second grade, but because we moved to North Carolina after he completed second grade.
Um, so, my family moved to North Carolina for a while because my brother was there. We were homeschooling initially as the schools in the area weren't very good. Eventually, we moved back and my sibling started fourth grade at Joaquin Miller in Oakland.
During my son's third grade, we moved to North Carolina for a year and then returned. He then joined Joaquin Miller in fourth grade but was struggling a lot. So, I decided to enroll him in the Pacific Boychoir Academy from the fourth grade again, hoping that it would give him a fresh start.
I have noticed that my partner has been more irritable lately, snapping at me more than usual. It's been happening at least three days out of the week or more days than not. He's been really angry and irritable.
I've noticed my child's irritability and anger increasing over time, especially in the past few months. He has been losing interest in his Taekwondo classes and I've pulled him out of tutoring because I feel like he's overwhelmed.
I've been feeling very depressed, low, down, and intimidated lately. I tried to imagine the worst and change my feelings, which took me a minute or two, but I am still struggling with disappointment.
As a patient, I am feeling sorry, regretful, and disappointed. I want to change my perspective and not feel horrified, terrified, down, or depressed. I have committed to practicing for a couple of minutes every day for 30 days to change my outlook. However, I'm concerned about the effectiveness of this brief exercise.
As a patient, I enjoy looking at flowers and gardening almost every day for pleasure, and I also like to pet my cat. However, I really hate doing housework, and I usually avoid it because of my dislike for it.
I've been struggling with housework and it feels overwhelming. I can't believe I have to spend an hour doing it in the coming days.
As the patient, I am struggling with anger and intimidation, and we have discussed these issues in previous sessions.
I have a pattern in my life that is really disturbing to me and I end up feeling bothered.
Lately, I've been feeling really intimidated by some situations, and it's causing me stress.
I feel so angry and guilty about certain situations in my life, but I don't understand why I should be experiencing these emotions.
I feel easily controlled and less than others. It feels like I'm constantly being left behind and not measuring up.
I often feel like I'm less than other people, and it's really been bothering me.
I feel weird right now after acknowledging that I am giving them permission. I am also angry, furious, and enraged at my supervisors who I assume are trying to intimidate me and are not very good at their job.
I think when I feel angry, I'm saying to myself, 'God, don't let them be right. Don't let them be right. Don't let them be right.'
I often feel intimidated and self-doubting, but when I get really angry, I feel like the people who are bothering me have no right to do so. They don't know what they're talking about and have no clue about what I'm doing in my performance.
I feel frustrated with my supervisors because I think they are acting stupid.
I'm worried because people around me tend to act stupidly, and I feel like they shouldn't, but they still do.
I feel frustrated and upset because my supervisors are not providing me with good supervision, and I wish they would recognize me as an efficient supervisee. I think their lack of support is causing me a lot of distress.
I have a strong preference for people to follow and be okay, but I'm struggling to find a reason why they must do so. I also wonder where it is written or heard that they should.
I've been struggling with my supervisors trying to intimidate me. I've been trying to tell myself that I am good, wise, and true to get rid of this feeling. But I still feel intimidated.
I don't like when people put me down, give me bad marks, and provide lousy supervision. It makes me feel intimidated, and I'm wondering if I should just, like, say 'I refuse to be intimidated by these people' out loud.
I feel like people around me are uncomfortable and intimidated. If I choose to contribute a little bit more, I could lessen the angst in the environment.
I have been feeling intimidated and angry with my supervisors because of their actions. They're not bad people, just making some stupid decisions, and it's affecting my emotional state.
I have been imagining a situation where people around me are getting worse and worse, becoming more prejudiced against me and making nasty remarks. I feel rejected and it's affecting me emotionally.
I am feeling very rejected, low, and down, maybe even depressed. I am trying to get in touch with these feelings and not suppress or repress them. I feel very low and rejected.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and anxious. My workload has been steadily increasing, and I can't seem to find enough time to do everything. It's causing me a lot of stress and it's starting to affect my sleep.
I've noticed that some people around me are acting very stupid, and it's frustrating me. I feel like it's too bad they don't act intelligently. I wish they could just change their behavior.
I've realized that I become easily intimidated by others, and it's really frustrating. I feel like people who are incapable of acting intelligently should do something, but I end up getting angry at myself for letting them intimidate me. It's such a waste of my energy.
I get really intimidated by some people, and then I put myself down for being intimidated. I feel like a loser for letting it happen, but I don't know how to stop it.
I have noticed that if I spent less energy on being angry, I might have better control over my emotions and reactions.
I've always felt that something was missing in my relationship with my father. I remember one incident when I was around 13-15 years old. I just needed him to be kind to me, but instead, it felt like he was always focused on the negatives and getting on my case.
I'm Peter and when I was 15, I had some problems with my school work. So, a friend and I decided to skip school and instead, went to the library in Birmingham to read about our hobby, which was more interesting than the school work. I wrote a letter to the school saying I was not well and signed it myself. My parents thought we were going to school.
I had a friend and we used to play truant together for a significant amount of time. My parents found out when the school called them asking if I was really off sick. They were shocked and couldn't understand what was going on. I got scolded by my mom when I came home.
My father recently started to act very strangely. He suddenly decided to hand over all of his financial records and even his self-written obituary to me. It feels like he believes it's his time to die, and I'm finding it extremely hard to cope with this situation.
I feel guilty because I wasn't as helpful and sympathetic towards my dad when he was trying to talk to me about his life and feelings. I didn't take him seriously and now I wish I could have sat with him to try and understand his emotions.
I've given up work now, and I'm worried that our finances are going to be a complete mess. This was the root of my worries, thinking that we won't be able to make ends meet, even though it turned out to be unnecessary later on.
I am struggling to accept that my dad has passed away. I really wish I had been able to communicate and connect with him earlier on. We had some superficial contact during our last couple of conversations. I tried to cheer him up, but I feel like I did it poorly, and I wish I could have done better for him.
I wish I could have told my dad that I loved him before he had ECT, but it's difficult because we never talked about feelings. I finally managed to tell him, but it feels awkward for both of us.
I find it difficult to contact my own feelings and it's awkward for me. I think it's because of my upbringing and my relationship with my mom. We never hugged and I wish we could have had a more affectionate relationship.
I had a friend who had a good sense of humor, but it was more of a poker face sense of humor. His idea of humor usually involved plays on words, and sometimes it felt like forced humor.
I have been thinking about my father lately. He was a very talented man, played the piano, and was a World War II veteran. He was wounded in the war and may have been traumatized, but he never talked much about it. I have two brothers and we were his family.
As the middle of three brothers, I felt that my father was a distant figure in our lives. He would only show up to discipline us if we misbehaved, which involved some sort of ceremonial beating with our trousers down.
I remember my father being very formal. If there was a problem, he would be brought in to administer punishment. I never got to know him, and it always felt like he was at a distance. I'm trying to think back to my earliest memories of him.
I can't really remember much about my father. He's a bit of a blank to me. The only things I can recall are that he was musical, a great pianist, and he wanted us to be successful together with my mother.
I've been thinking about what to share with you today, and I wanted to talk about my parents, particularly my father. I had a difficult relationship with both my parents, and my mother was very critical of me.
My mom was hard on me and very critical, but my father was the one I wanted to talk about today. By the time my mom died, we had come to an understanding, and I started to like her. However, my father and I never really connected, and I am now in my 60s.
I was born in 1946, and my father died in the 1990s at the age of 80. My early upbringing was in the late 40s and the 50s in a household where children were seen and not heard, and big boys don't cry.
I'm having trouble finding the right word to describe my father. People would often describe him as poker faced.
I have been carrying something bothering me since childhood and feeling as if I was the silly one in my family. My father, mother, and the overall family situation contributed to this feeling. Also, my mother was very concerned about my appearance and would constantly remind me to sit up straight.
My mother always focused on appearance and seemed to pass judgment on my children based on their inherited physical traits. I was the one in the family always getting into trouble, and there was a disconnection between me and my father. Now, I'm thinking about my position in the family, and this feeling is connected to both of my parents, although more directly to my mother because she would be explicit about things.
I remember my father always having a frown on his face, and my mother seemed to see him as unsuccessful. I'm not sure exactly why she felt that way, but it has always bothered me.
Growing up, my parents always pushed me and my siblings to be successful. However, we never really talked about our feelings for each other. When I was a teenager, I faced a lot of problems at home and was seen as the clumsy and difficult one.
My older brother was the clever one and my younger brother was seen as the loved one. I felt like I was stuck in the middle, missing out on both love and cleverness. I was always the one in trouble and got punished more.
When I was around seven or eight years old in prep school, we were given 100 conduct marks at the beginning of each quarter, and we were supposed to have at least 50 left by the end. I don't know why, but I was the one who always lost marks, sometimes going into the negatives. Why was I so naughty?
I remember when I was younger, my brothers would get good marks for conduct, like 50 or more, but my conduct marks would go down and down, even into negative territory. I'm beginning to think there must have been something wrong with me at the age of seven or eight.
I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and unsure about how much time is left in our session. I'm considering closing my eyes and leaning back, but I'm not sure if that's appropriate.
I find it helpful when I try to sit straight up and focus on my breathing. I feel a sense of relief and release, especially when I deeply exhale, blowing out all the air, and taking time to come back into the present moment.
As the patient, I want to express my gratitude for the counsellor's help during this session. It was really powerful and I appreciate their understanding of the deep and painful emotions that I've shared. I'm still feeling moved and touched, and I know that these feelings will stay with me for a while as I process everything.
I feel ready to go, and I need to let my dad know that he is loved, surrounded by people who love and respect his decision. That includes me, my mom, Richard, Laurance, and the rest of our family.
I recently experienced a very emotional moment, saying goodbye to someone I loved. It was surprisingly deep and impactful, and now I'm trying to process those emotions and see where I am right now.
Well, I could feel, umm… as if it was happening, as if it was really happening. So now, I'm feeling as if, uh… I don't know whether the word is catharsis, as if, uh… let something go that I hadn't like before. A little bit of relief and release, just a bit more relaxed.
I feel a tightness in my chest and a headache. The tightness in my chest has reduced but the headache is still there.
I remember my dad in his last days when he was really old, and it was terrible. I just wish I could have helped him.
I feel so sad when I picture my father as old and unwell. By the time he died, he was diagnosed with clinical depression and went into a downward spiral. I wish I could have taken away some of his troubles and helped him get out of this.
I'm struggling to connect with my dad who is in a state where he's almost silent and stares into space. He had electric shock treatment which helped him communicate again, but it's still very challenging.
I feel like it's difficult for me to do things like the last time, especially when I have to say something like 'the last time I saw you.' I feel like I'm talking to someone else.
I tried to get my dad's attention by doing something I knew he wouldn't agree with. When I told him the reason behind my actions was to attract his attention and plead for some affection, he finally acknowledged his love for me and burst into tears, which is something I had rarely seen before.
I felt a sense of relief when I realized someone cared about me, but it was also painful, like a balloon bursting.
I feel sad about my father getting lower and lower as he got older, and then he had what my mother called a nervous breakdown. He sat in the sitting room, stared into space, and she couldn't get a word out of him. She called me, not sure whether it was because I'm the nicest or because I was geographically closer, and said I had to come.
I really needed to talk to you about a situation, where my dad was about to punish me. My friend and I got into trouble at school, and we were put in detention. I felt terrified waiting for my father to come home, and I remember having a one-on-one interview with him that evening.
I recently recounted an incident from my past to someone. It was when I confronted my dad about him not loving me, and he broke down in tears saying he does love me. It was a significant moment, but I don't recall ever telling him I loved him.
I was feeling scared and angry about my situation. I remember telling my dad that I did something because I felt he didn't love me, and he burst into tears. I'm not sure how to address the situation with my dad now.
I feel as if something was missing in my relationship with my father. He seemed to not exist in my life, except when he would be invoked to punish us. I would describe this feeling as pain, but I don't know where I can capture that sense of something missing in me.
I'm experiencing a headache when thinking about my relationship with my dad. We have barely made contact over the years, and I feel like there is something missing. The pain I'm feeling may not be just about my dad but my entire family.
I'm willing to give it a try and imagine someone in the empty chair here. I can picture him there, and the distance is fine for me.
I have been struggling ever since the traumatic events unfolded in my town. It's overwhelming witnessing the aftermath, and it has had an impact on my community and my work as a counselor. Businesses aren't there anymore, funerals are frequent, and the air itself seems different. I find myself grappling with trying to understand why bad things happen and how we as a community can learn from this.
I recently started leading an unemployment group consisting of people who have lost their jobs. There's so much loss involved in this whole scenario, especially for men whose jobs defined their identity.
I was on a healing trip after my divorce when 9/11 happened. I only saw the news in a store days later. When I returned to New York, I felt out of step and disconnected from what others had experienced. I desperately missed being there as a former news reporter and as a counselor, I wanted to help. The strongest feeling was as a mother with two boys in New York. I stayed up all night trying to call them until I finally got an email from one of them.
I went up to the top of the roof at school and looked down 10 miles to the World Trade Center and saw the smoke and flames. It was very upsetting and reminded me of when I was in college at Georgetown when Martin Luther King was killed. Soldiers were on the streets, and places were closed. It felt like the loss of my political innocence, and I was thinking Ted went through this experience at the same time.
I've noticed that many people, regardless of their age, are seeking more fulfilling careers, wanting to get married and have children, and finding more happiness in their relationships. It seems like everyone suddenly realized that life is short and they want to make the most of it. As a mid-life issues specialist, I see this pattern in both younger and older clients.
As a patient, I've noticed that people, including myself, want more control over their lives. This is a common theme that seems to be changing and impacting everyone.
I've been working on calming myself and my anger down for two and a half years now, and I feel like I'm making progress, but it's taking a lot of time.
I had just moved with my mom to Montana, and I was at a bar playing pool and listening to rap music. A guy there made a racist comment which I confronted him about. My mom tried telling me that people are different here, but I stood my ground because I don't tolerate racist comments and it should offend her too, since I'm her son.
Recently, there was a situation where I was mad at someone, and my friend advised me to calm down. I didn't really listen to her at the time, but I've noticed that from then till now, I've calmed down a lot. I don't get mad as easily as I used to and don't flip out as bad as I did. Though, sometimes I still do, but it just takes a lot of time for me to work on it.
I have a few favorite recreational activities - I like playing football and basketball, as well as drawing and writing music.
I enjoy writing lyrics, football, basketball, and drawing. Those are my favorite things to do. However, I also seem to hate these same activities because they make me mad sometimes.
I get frustrated and mad when I don't perform well in activities like basketball, football, drawing, or writing music. These are my favorite things to do, but they can also be my worst experiences when I struggle with them.
I don't really mean to be a perfectionist, but I try to be. I don't like to be...
I never feel like I've done well enough, whether it's in a sport like basketball or football, or even in my drawings. It's never quite perfect, and I feel a lot of pressure because of that. I think this is why I get angry and take it out on others.
I need your help because when things don't go right, when I don't score 30, when I don't do things perfectly, I go berserk. How can you help me with this perfectionism problem?
It feels different in a way, like I don't want to miss anything and I want to be the best player always, no matter who I'm playing with. I really don't like to get beaten or do anything wrong, because if I do it just shows that I'm weak.
I've played a sport and I would rate my performance about 50% most of the time. I had a couple of times when I achieved 100% in my game, but I still wouldn't give myself an A for those times.
I never give myself 100 percent because I can always do better. I wouldn't give anybody 100 percent except for a couple of people in the NBA. I can make every shot, but I can't play my best. Playing my best means never getting touched, never having the ball stolen, never getting stopped, dunking, and everything.
As a patient, I feel like I struggle to be perfect and achieve a certain level of success. I can manage to barely reach it, but I can't seem to fully succeed. It's like I can only rim but not dunk, and it's frustrating that I have to do everything perfectly without making a single mistake.
I recently started drawing and writing music as non-competitive hobbies, but I still get frustrated with myself. I'm wondering if quitting smoking might help me feel less uptight.
I think nicotine might be affecting my mood because it's a stimulant. I do smoke and I know I should quit.
I'm working on quitting smoking, but it's really hard. I still smoke almost every day, but I don't think it affects me when I play basketball because I've been doing both for so long.
As a patient, I've been struggling with quitting smoking. I know I could greatly improve my physical performance if I quit since I would have more stamina and wouldn't get tired so easily. It's just that quitting is so hard, and I have mixed feelings about smoking - I hate it but also like it.
I find it hard to change the way I think because it feels stuck in my mind, and I'm struggling with managing my anger issues as a result.
I'm struggling with the idea that I need to think differently and not focus on being perfect. I find it hard to think of certain things as just a game or something that doesn't matter.
I often think about things that matter to me, and it affects my mood. But my friend Shawn is suggesting that I should change my way of thinking to feel better. What should I do if I can't change my thoughts?
I'm finding it difficult to change the way I'm thinking. I tried playing a game, but it's not helping, and I'm worried that if I keep failing, I'll just get even more frustrated.
I've been trying to improve at something, so I thought maybe taking a break from it for a while might help. When I stop playing and then start again, I usually find that I'm a little better. Do you think taking some time off or trying a new hobby could be beneficial?
As a patient, I have faced some challenging situations in life like moving from Utah to California. Also, my parents got divorced, and I believe that these events had a significant impact on my mental and emotional wellbeing.
When my parents divorced, it was challenging. My dad decided to move to California and took my siblings with him, but not me. We moved from Utah to California, and the two places had very different cultures.
I've been struggling with my grades and recently got caught cutting class a few times with my friends just to have some fun and relieve stress. My grades were really important to me, but now they're not my priority and I don't know why.
Lately, I've been prioritizing hanging out with my friends over school. I don't really know why there's a shift in my priorities. I've been playing sports with them for a long time and it's just us, you know, doing our own thing. My stepmom used to talk with me but now she's been fighting a lot with my dad, so we don't get to talk as much.
I have been facing a lot of conflict lately, and my life revolves around school and sports, leaving me no time for anything else. This has led me to get into some trouble, and I'm not sure why I am acting this way when I am under stress.
I feel like my dad and that part of my family like me, but I also feel like an outsider sometimes. It was hard for me to find someone who would accept me for who I am because I felt like I always had to change myself to fit in. I feel angry at my dad, and also sad and disappointed about being left out and not staying true to myself in school.
Some days, I really think about my situation and it gets me down, especially when my mom is at work and I feel alone. But the change has also kind of helped with the feelings. My thoughts about my parents' divorce and my dad taking my siblings elicit a lot of anger, sadness, and disappointment.
I went from a non-diverse school in Utah to a diverse one in California, and after that move, I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere. Additionally, my parents divorced when I was young, which was devastating for me.
I feel like my dad didn't think of me as his daughter and that I was an outsider. He didn't really care about me, and I felt like I wasn't a priority. My mom was the only one who really cared, but she was working all the time and didn't have much time to spend with me, so I was often alone.
I've been struggling with negative thoughts due to some past events in my life, and I wonder if I can change these thoughts that lead to my actions. Does that make more sense?
I attended a counselling session, and we discussed some issues that were troubling me. The counsellor made sure I understood everything, and I found the session to be really helpful. At the end, we agreed to set up an appointment for next week.
I've noticed that when I'm under the influence of anger and sadness, I end up behaving differently. Lately, I've been hanging around with some kids who tend to bully others, and I've realized that I don't stand up for the victims and this goes against my value system.
I often feel spiteful towards my parents, and that might be the reason why I cut class and choose to hang out with my friends instead of going home. After I do these things, I feel guilty, especially when I don't stick up for others when my friends make fun of them, and when my grades go down because I know I can do something about it.
I have been feeling stuck in a past relationship that is already over, and I think it's preventing me from making new connections, not just in terms of romantic relationships, but also with friends.
I often find myself constantly thinking about a particular person, and it feels like I cannot move on with the rest of my life because of this obsession. Does this mean I am still in love with him?
I raised my children by myself after my husband left, and everyone says I did a good job. They are trying to better themselves and get their careers together, and they're serious about school. Also, my son told me the other day I did a very good job as his mother, which made me feel good.
I've had this ongoing pattern in my life of choosing people like Sylvester, and I'm worried about falling into the same pattern again in the future. I thought I would just try to be more careful, take things slower and really get to know someone before getting involved with them. I believe this experience has been a lesson for me.
Lately, I've noticed red flags in potential romantic partners and have dismissed them right away. I wonder if I'm holding onto my ex, Sylvester, to slow things down and avoid getting involved in another relationship. I seem to have a pattern of picking 'losers' and hoping they would change. I might be a rescuer.
I used to believe that I could fix people's problems.
I was talking to my therapist about my relationship. We discussed how my partner tends to sabotage our relationship, but I am still blaming them for it. I brought this up during our session and shared my concerns with the therapist.
I feel like I don't have any other way to handle my victimization other than blaming others. I know I need to stop isolating myself, but I think it's okay to be alone sometimes. I'm considering going to self-help groups, but I'm not sure if that supports my powerlessness. I also want to try to let go of past relationships, but I'm not very confident about it. I'm also worried about pleasing others and seeking their approval in therapy.
I struggle to present myself in a positive way and build meaningful connections with people. I tend to play the victim and don't know how to handle relationships with people who genuinely love me, because I've never had anyone who truly loved me, not even my mother.
I'm coming from a Chinese background, and I believe in Taoism. Sometimes, I meditate to attain peace. I would like to know your philosophy as a therapist, especially when you've traveled to different places and learned from various cultures.
As a patient, I feel like the counsellors I see in videos or during workshops seem so perfect in their sessions. I can't help but compare myself to them and feel like I am not as good as them. I'm worried I might not be an effective counsellor.
As a patient coming from a Chinese culture background, I appreciate how serious and attentive you were when I was sharing my problems. Also, I noticed that you remembered a lot of details from our previous conversations, which made me feel like you had a map in your mind. However, I felt a bit unsure when you were trying to provide insights about my issues, like identifying patterns or attachments. It seemed you didn't have any doubt when moving on to the next agenda.
I have been thinking about your comments on how you don't really care about the techniques. I've been trying to identify your counseling style, but it's hard to pinpoint as I can see elements of Rogerian and solution-focused approaches. That has made me question your overall design for helping me achieve my desires.
As a patient, I feel frustrated that as a beginner in therapy, I'm looking for concrete answers and specifics about how the process works. I'm also concerned about the fact that the outcomes of therapy might not be exactly what I expect or remember.
I have been working with Harriet in therapy, but I sometimes wonder if she really wants to change or if she's just here to look like she's making an effort. I try to trust her and believe what she presents during our sessions.
As the patient, I didn't provide any information or ask any questions.
I really don't know what it would take for me to not only realize when someone is not giving me what I deserve and what I want in a relationship, but also to remember it when it really counts. Right now, this situation feels so low, and I don't feel like I have the energy or the drive to do what it would take.
I am feeling a bit out of control in one area of my life, while everything else seems to be going well. I am attending classes and bettering myself in other ways, but I have noticed that I seem to make poor choices in relationships, like the one I had with Sylvester.
I was in a relationship with a drug addict and it was really bad, so I ended up in deep depression and stayed away from relationships for about 3 years. My previous partner, Sylvester, was very angry. I think I just pick the wrong people, maybe because my father was emotionally distant and my mother wasn't very helpful.
I think if I didn't have this problem anymore and didn't think about him at all, it would be relaxing and feel much better. But I am also worried about the loneliness that comes with it. I feel like he threw me out into the world by myself, and as long as I stay obsessed with him, it's like I still have a part of him with me and I'm not quite so alone.
I've been feeling really lonely and alone lately. Even though Sylvester is out of my life, I'm still thinking about him constantly. I feel like I haven't been able to set any goals or do much because my thoughts are preoccupied with him.
Lately, I've been using my boyfriend as a kind of excuse not to pursue certain opportunities or make myself more available for other things. I'm not entirely sure why I'm doing this, though.
I've been struggling with being alone and the idea of being without a man in my life. I'm trying to toy with the idea of taking the risk, but I'm not quite ready to commit to it yet.
As a patient, I feel like the clients that counsellors think they're helping the most might just be pretending, and the ones that appear to not have been helped at all might have actually benefited from the session.
As a patient, I visited a therapist only once or twice, but I want to express my gratitude for the significant difference they made in my life. I made several changes after our sessions, and I just remembered that I never really thanked them properly.
As a patient, I'm not sure which therapy theory to choose, but my mentor suggested one that he strongly supports. What do you think about following that specific theory?
As a patient, I noticed that the counsellor was following a person-centered approach to build a relationship with me. However, during the middle of our session, I felt that they seemed to be feeling trapped. What could be the reasons behind this?
I remember talking to my previous counselor about what I didn't like about their approach, and she had warned me. However, I feel as if I was set up to experience the same thing again. I labeled my experience in a more person-centered way, but I still feel uncomfortable.
As the patient, I felt like my counsellor really listened to me and helped me feel heard. They took their time to understand my concerns and kept referring back to them throughout the conversation. I was impressed with how they were able to keep track of everything I mentioned.
I've been learning counseling for 25 years, and had some really good mentors with the dominant model back then. However, I've moved beyond that, but I still feel like there's much more for me to learn.
I've been seeing a therapist who has given me some affirmations for positive thinking, which has been helpful. She also had me create a list of tasks and provided me with support and encouragement when I completed them. This made me feel better because I've been lacking support in my life.
Lately, I've been going through a lot of stuff and I didn't have much support in my life at that time. But I had a friend who was very supportive. I would just vent to her, and she would listen to me, and I would feel better after I left because I got a lot of things that were bothering me out.
I've been having a hard time getting away from a destructive relationship because I tend to forget what we discuss in our sessions. My therapist pointed out that this person is similar to my family background, and we made a chart comparing their qualities to those of my family and ex-husband. Then, we made a chart of what I really want, and she showed me that what I want and what this person is are different. However, I still feel like I might be addicted to him and can't let go.
Sometimes, my brain tells me that something is the right thing to do, but I still feel hesitant and unsure about it. Why does this happen?
I'm holding on to Sylvester because I feel like it might be my last chance. Sometimes I think that maybe in a few years, he'll realize what a wonderful person I am and how good I am for him.
I'll probably remember what you said about him sabotaging the relationship and about not isolating myself. And maybe having my counselor talk about ways to feel good about myself being alone. I think maybe that's where we should work on.
I'm attending meetings and trying to let go of someone who's significant in my life, but I'm still hesitant about this decision. I don't like being pushed by others to make choices I'm not ready for yet. What do you suggest I do?
I think I need to have a plan in order to manage my life better.
I recently realized that I have abandonment issues and I think I'm love addicted because I've been reading a lot about it. I really want love in my life, but sometimes I'm afraid that it might be too late for me, being an older person. I might tell my counselor about what I've learned about isolating myself.
I've noticed a pattern in my relationships where the other person takes from me and doesn't give back. I guess I need to find someone who loves me back. But maybe I should also focus on finding love and support in other ways, without a man.
It's just been so frustrating for me that it doesn't feel like my efforts have been reciprocated in this one dimension or area. And in some ways, I do feel discouraged about whether I'm ever going to be able to enjoy that kind of equal relationship with someone.
I first came to counseling because I was feeling depressed about a relationship and struggling to manage different aspects of my life, such as classes, children, and work. My counselor has helped me to think more positive and start to feel better, but I'm still trying to find a way to juggle all these responsibilities.
I was dealing with stress and a verbally abusive relationship, which my previous therapist was helping me with. We would work on how to build myself back up after being hurt. Recently, I finally broke up with the person, but now I'm feeling sad again. I'm trying to get over the break up.
I have been under a lot of stress because of work and my children are going away to school, leaving me alone. Additionally, I'm going through a job change where I'll be doing something completely new.
I've been working with a patient who is already seeing another counselor, so I'm being cautious because I don't want to mess anything up. I want to make sure my work supports the existing therapy.
As I was watching counseling videos, I noticed how skilled the counsellor was in several different theories and approaches. I worry that as a counseling student, I might feel overwhelmed trying to become proficient in so many areas. How can beginners manage this and avoid feeling overwhelmed?
Recently, I have been trying various relaxation techniques, and I've tried 13 different ones, but I can't seem to find one that works for me. Could you please suggest how I can find the right technique?
I've been feeling that things like risk-taking, bungee jumping, and parachuting can be important metaphors for what we're asking in our lives. But I'm concerned about how taking more risks may lead to ethical problems or exploitation in relationships.
I feel uncomfortable when I realize my own hypocrisy in a session. I find it difficult to ask clients to do something that I'm unwilling or unable to do myself, and it makes me question my effectiveness as a therapist.
I've been struggling lately to even get out of bed in the morning, but somehow I manage to drag myself to work and do a good job with my clients.
As a patient, I have been struggling with feelings of worthlessness, specifically that I'm not worthwhile unless there is a man in my life. This has led me to make sacrifices in my relationships, as my dad used to say that I 'pay a lot for a man'.
I've been experiencing some problems lately, and I'm not sure how to deal with them. I feel like these situations might be something familiar from my past.
I feel like my behavior is meant to keep me from being alone, and I wonder if my actions are functional in achieving that goal. Is there a specific scheme or structure you have in mind for counselling me in this situation?
I've been having trouble with my therapist, as we seem to be stuck in our sessions, and I feel like I'm not making progress. I get along better with other therapists and tend to be more cooperative with them. What should I do?
I'm a counselor trainee, and I see that there's a higher level of connection between the counselor, therapist, and the client beyond our current understanding. I'm wondering how we can encourage junior counselors or therapists to admire and explore this freedom and space that exists beyond our conceptualization.
I've been obsessing over this one area of my life involving Sylvester, but I recently took an inventory of my whole life context, which made me realize that while this situation may not be going so well, I have other aspects such as roller skating and friends who have been supportive about the situation.
I have been feeling low and I don't want to interact with people. My friends and family make comments about me looking sad, and it makes me want to isolate myself further. When I do go out, I pretend to be feeling better than I actually am.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and stressed about my personal life and work. I'm not sure how to cope with these emotions. In my next session with my counselor, I will talk about our conversation and how it affected me.
I felt like I was so low that I couldn't get direction. My previous counsellor even told me how I looked, stating that I appeared like a little, lonely child sitting in the corner. It made me feel worse, and I cried because I felt like she was beating me up. Her confrontations made me feel like I should just go and hide instead of facing the world.
As a patient, I have been seeing a counselor already, and I'm here just for this one meeting with you. I would like to know how you can support the work I am already doing without causing any interference.
I have been working on letting go of my children, as I am living alone again, and it feels more lonely since my recent relationship ended. Additionally, I am dealing with a job transition and all the stress that comes with it.
I've been trying to move on from a past relationship, but there's a part of me that still feels connected to him. Even though my previous counselor told me what to do, I would often forget their advice when I went home.
I always felt that my previous partner was the one for me. We got along very well, had good conversations, and he was intelligent. However, there were a lot of things that he did that weren't good for me at all and made me not feel good about myself.
I've been having trouble in my previous counseling sessions because when my relationship ended for the second time, my previous counsellor didn't seem to want to help me. Instead, she just told me that I had to make up my own mind, which left me feeling really bad and distraught.
I've been working on things like doing my artwork, getting more physical exercise, and bettering myself in school. However, I've isolated myself and don't have a lot of support. I've recently started attending some 12-step meetings.
Lately, I've been attending a spiritual group meeting which has helped me to think more clearly about situations. In my past relationship, I feel like I was somewhat controlling because I was trying to push my partner to have the relationship with me. I have started to blame myself for this behavior.
I've been realizing how powerless I am over people, places, and things, and that I have no control over them. However, putting my life in God's hands and following the 12-step program has been helping me.
I recently attended a group session where people shared their stories and I realized that it's mostly this one area in my life where I feel out of control, while other people seemed to struggle with multiple areas. I felt less alone and it was actually good for me in a way because my issues seem less overwhelming compared to others.
I have a history of making poor choices in relationships. I was with a drug addict who put me through a lot of hardship, and I went into a deep depression. I avoided relationships for about three years before getting involved with Sylvester, who is also very angry. I feel like I just pick the wrong people.
I've been feeling really consumed by negative emotions lately, and I've noticed that I tend to take myself too seriously. I've heard that humor could potentially be an antidote for my depression, but sometimes it's hard for me to see the absurdity in my situation. Can you help me with this?
As the patient, I think I need a breakthrough but it feels like the whole world has to change. I haven't been completely honest with my counselor yet and there's so much I haven't told them about what I do and how it affects me.
As a patient, I recently had a therapy session where my therapist used various techniques. He was strategic, used some reframing, and asked me what works and what doesn't work. He also used some cognitive approaches about cueing and being language sensitive. He didn't use as much cognitive stuff as he normally would but asked me what I was thinking about and what I would think about after the session.
I've been feeling stuck in my situation with Sylvester, and it's been affecting me negatively. I'm trying to understand the stories I tell myself from a constructivist point of view and my own phenomenological experience. What are some alternative stories that I could consider to help me feel better? What would things be like if this problem was resolved?
I'm having a hard time dealing with how much control and power I've given away to certain men in my life. I feel like it's affecting my sense of self-worth and self-respect. Can you help me with this issue?
As a patient, I have a question about how your integrative approach, which I find fluid and different for every client, relates to cultural intentionality like in Allen Ivey's model. I notice how Ivey stresses on skills, techniques, and cultural aspects, so I'm curious how your approach is different or similar to his in terms of incorporating culture.
I feel like the people in South Chicago have a very different culture from the suburbs in the north, and it also varies by gender, religion, and ethnicity. It's important to change our approach according to these different aspects to understand who a person is and where they come from.
I am feeling a bit overwhelmed because you're discussing a variety of subjects, such as cultural-mindedness and incorporating 12 or 13 different theories or techniques. I sense that there's an authentic use of self in your approach, but when I hear words like 'chameleon' and 'eclectic', I can't help but feel like we might be playing games or acting mechanically. Can you help me understand how to manage these feelings?
I was in a relationship with someone who would often say mean and cruel things to push me away. I tried to overlook it and made excuses for him, but he didn't seem to care about me as much as I cared about him. Even after talking to my counselor about all the reasons why this relationship wasn't good for me, I still feel confused and frustrated.
I feel like I have two conflicting thoughts in my head. One part of me wants to end my relationship because it's not good for me, but the other part loves and cares for my partner, and I've invested a lot in this relationship. When I'm with them, the negative thoughts don't seem as important.
I've been going back and forth about a decision, and it's making me very tired. I think about it constantly, morning and night.
I'm feeling worried about making mistakes and looking foolish, especially with the pressure from managed care to make quick progress.
I've been struggling with trying to imitate the way other people work, especially my mentors. I attend workshops, but I still feel incompetent and it's getting me into trouble.
As a patient, I have experienced some tragic results with more intrusive and paradoxical techniques. They were quite aggressive and did not work out the way they were shown in the video tapes.
I don't know what it would take for me to move on in my relationship with Sylvester. I guess, maybe look for another man? But I'm not really ready to let go of Sylvester yet, despite my counselor and friends' advice.
I feel so annoyed and controlled by Sylvester, he's the one who decided to end things and it's not good for me.
I am struggling to move forward in my life and feel like I deserve more. I want to become the kind of person who can confidently say no to people who make me feel unworthy. However, I am not there yet. How can I get to that point?
As a patient, I'd say that my children and other people think I'm a good mother, but I have a hard time taking pride in my motherhood role. It didn't seem important to me and I had no choice but to be in that situation.
As a single parent, I never had the luxury of thinking about what I wanted to do. But now, in my work and career, I am finally at a point where I am asking myself what I want to do. I haven't been satisfied with what I've been doing, and I am taking charge of my life by wanting to go in a completely new direction. I am really happy about the job change.
I managed to pass a course and get a job I was on the waiting list for about a year. When there was an opening, they called me and asked if I was still interested. After agreeing, I studied hard, watched videos, and passed the course. I only missed two questions out of 50 and I'm really proud of myself.
I feel like I never really got too connected with anyone in my life - not my father, my kids, or even my boyfriend. It feels like I am just going through everything without really feeling a connection. Is there a place for me to make these connections stronger?
I can sense that I have a victim mentality and carry a lot of anger and resentment around it. I am also very compliant, and I think my experience as an African-American woman has a connection to my current situation. How would you help me deal with this anger and figure out its roots?
As a patient, I am stuck in a pattern where I try to change my behavior but end up doing the same thing just slower. I struggle with finding constructive solutions and taking meaningful steps forward. My therapist mentioned that they were trying to help me gain insight and translate that into constructive action, but I'm still not getting the outcome I want.
I am struggling with letting go, especially as my children are leaving and I'll be alone. I also had a difficult time letting go of a person with whom I was involved, but they told me today that they have moved on, which helped a little bit.
I'm having trouble letting go of not just my children but also a recent relationship that ended. He decided he didn't want to see me anymore and told me he hated me. That really hurt. He said I couldn't handle being with him because we wanted different things. He had just gotten out of a divorce and wasn't ready for a relationship whereas I've been divorced for years and was ready for a committed relationship. It wasn't my choice to end it.
I recently went through a breakup with my partner, Sylvester. It felt like he just always pushed me away.
I've tried to help people in my life, like the drug addict who stopped using after I prayed for him, but it seems none of my efforts have really worked. For example, I couldn't change my ex, and now I'm wondering if my efforts have been a waste of energy. Am I truly destined to be independent and not relying on a man to be happy?
I am scared of losing not only my partner Sylvester, but also my children, and having to live alone. This fear might lead me to make a much worse decision by choosing somebody not necessarily good for me just for companionship. What should I do to avoid making such a bad choice?
I can't help but feel like you know what I should do, and if you knew, you would tell me.
I've noticed that when I think about my relationship, I start to wonder if I should just look for another person to feel loved. But at the same time, I also believe that I can feel loved even without a partner. Sometimes, I feel like I'm holding on to my partner for the wrong reasons, but I'm not sure what to do. Can you help me with this situation?
I remember once working with a couple from India. The husband didn't want his wife to work, and he wanted me to tell her to stay home. He told me that in their country, counselors give advice and tell people what to do. I ended up giving them advice, which is against the typical counseling practice in America. They never came back, and I was so worried about them.
I think there was a time during a crisis where I harbored resentment for having to be the go-to person in my family to take care of things. I have a division between my life here and my life at home, and my parents only know the safe aspects of my life, like school and work. They don't know about my personal relationships and I wish I could resolve this issue with them.
I have been struggling with whether or not to tell my family about my personal life. They keep probing about my relationship status, but I never feel like it's the right time to talk about it. I always want to tell them in person, but during family time, I don't want to bring bad news or difficult conversations.
I've faced difficulty in being assertive while discussing my perspectives at work, especially when I'm not sure if the management will be receptive. I usually back off if they don't respond positively to my initial attempts. I've seen colleagues continuing to push their ideas, but I can't bring myself to do so, especially in my current job which doesn't feel very personally important to me.
I am willing to initiate feedback, even if it goes against others' actions, but I back away when it comes to negative implications. I maintain my personal life and meet some of my family's expectations, but only to some extent. I never saw this connection before. My family seems responsive to indirect cues, like when I laugh off a question rather than answering it.
As a patient, I've been noticing that I'm very aware of boundaries with my family members. Whenever it seems like we might cross a line, we back off or I back off.
When I was younger, my family was really weird about me coming out as a teenager. However, as we all grew up, it became a non-issue. They now accept my partner, Yoshi, like any other family member. The only soft spot in our relationship is with my parents. I've tried not to make waves with them and have been fortunate to have many opportunities in my work life.
I often find myself in situations, like a new job or relationship, where things aren't working out. My first response is to try to make the best of it. I think I handle the challenges passively and focus more on making the best of the situation, but I'm not sure where I learned this value.
I've been working in carpentry and I always try to give my best in my job. I've been wanting to make some changes in my current workplace, and although I can make small changes outside of my scope of work, I don't want to push anyone's buttons or press other people.
I was kind of forced into a parenting role for my siblings because of our age gaps and my parents working all the time. My older siblings took care of me, and then when they left the house, I had to take care of my younger siblings. Our family heavily relied on each other for support. It seems like I played a big role in my brother's upbringing and now my family looks to me in times of crisis.
I've had limited experience with counseling, and I want someone who serves as a sounding board but is also proactive. I want to get something out of the sessions. In my past experiences, I hit a wall and felt like it wasn't progressing. I initially thought I'd prefer a counselor who shares my personal experiences, but I had a positive experience with a counselor who was different than I expected. I'm still working with communities of color and trying to find my place in different management systems.
I like my new job because it allows me to work with a lot of people and gives me a fair amount of responsibility. Besides that, I've recently started night school in a Masters degree program full time, which is a good balance between my day job and night school.
I have a close relationship with my parents and they once had the idea of me, their son, moving in with them as they get older, even though I have an older brother. But they've now realized that all their kids have their own lives to live. I feel torn and conflicted about the idea of moving in with them, as I love my life here with my boyfriend. I'd try to find a middle ground if needed, but I want to enjoy my life too.
I'm currently torn between working in grassroots organizing or pursuing a white-collar job in city planning or community development. I am passionate about making a difference, but I also feel the need to make a decent income, as I come from a working-class background. I'm worried that grassroots work can be emotionally draining and doesn't provide the same stability as a nine-to-five job.
I have been supporting myself and my family since I moved to New York at 17. My family is in Boston, and although their demands aren't high, I help them out here and there. Now, my parents are getting older and don't work anymore, and my little brother is in college. I want to provide for myself and my life here, as well as help out my family back home.
I'm worried that people will judge me if I decide to move to Paris for experience, but they seem to be supportive when I make sacrifices for school or work. I'm not sure how this decision will be perceived and how it would impact my career path.
I have been avoiding my friends and family by blaming my absence on work. I feel guilty about it, but it's easier to tell them I have to work instead of admitting that I just don't want to attend their gatherings.
I am facing some issues with my younger brother. He's struggling in various aspects of his life, like finding a job and performing well in school. My parents are quite concerned about him as they think he's hanging out with the wrong crowd. They didn't have to worry about my older siblings and me, but they are quite hands-on with him, which makes me feel like I am getting involved in something I'd rather not be a part of.
I've been trying to support my sibling in school but I'm struggling to find a good balance between helping and seeming overbearing. My parents think I'm the only one who can get through to them, but it's still tough. How can I better assist my sibling without being too intrusive?
I feel disempowered in helping my brother, and my parents seem to have given up on controlling him. I'm trying to find small ways to show him support and make him feel like somebody is on his side. But, I also feel some reluctance in getting involved in his life.
I'm really struggling with the decision to come out to my parents about my sexual orientation. I have a happy relationship and I'd love to share it with them. However, I'm afraid it would be a burden on them and cause a strain in our relationship. I'm worried that if I come out to them, I wouldn't be able to be there for them.
I feel like discussing my sexual orientation with my family isn't important compared to other larger family issues, but it also creates a barrier in communication. I have made decisions for my own needs, like going to college, staying in New York, and pursuing opportunities here.
I grew up in a Vietnamese family, with my parents and older siblings being first generation immigrants. We were a self-contained unit, relying on and supporting each other. I often feel selfish because I don't want to give everything to my family, but I feel like I should give them more. I've struggled for a long time with how much to give and where to draw boundaries.
I have been feeling more comfortable with balancing family demands recently. A couple of years ago, I would give too much and feel burned out, leading to a cycle of crisis-focused relationships. I learned to balance my own needs with my family's and am now more at peace with my boundaries.
I often maintain a certain distance from my family to ensure they don't cross any boundaries. However, I've noticed that my sister, who lives closer to our parents, is more direct in expressing her desire not to visit them on certain weekends. I don't think I could ever be as assertive as she is in that respect.
I feel bad saying that to my mom that I don't want to see her right now. If I said that, she would probably have the same reaction as me saying, 'Oh, I have to work this weekend. I can't come home for the long holiday.' It's just so much easier to say that I have to work, instead of telling her that I want to spend a weekend in the city with my friends and my boyfriend.
I think my family respects my boundaries now that I've decided to move away for school. There are certain things that I can sacrifice for, like if I wanted to move to Paris for six months and try to live there.
I feel like my eight-year-old self was trapped in a regimented dictatorship, not a family. I was always on edge, afraid of causing any kind of disruption in the rigid environment, but at the same time, I wanted to rebel and let loose.
I feel afraid and alone due to my unsupportive family. I want to run away because I don't feel loved and I feel humiliated most of the time. I even wrote letters expressing my feelings of wanting to leave.
I don't feel that there is anyone I can talk to. I remember once my sister and I decided to run away. I told my mom that we're running away because I feel trapped in this house and I don't feel I can do anything right. I don't really think I did anything particularly that wrong compared to my other friends who are complete wrecks.
When I try to control my emotions, I feel like I'm telling myself not to breathe, and if I breathe, I shouldn't breathe too loudly. I just want to keep everything in line and be in control, even though it makes me feel rigid.
I've been feeling like I can't express my thoughts or emotions because of the way I was raised by my adoptive mother. I'm afraid that if I do, I'll get in trouble. I don't talk about my feelings and even find it hard to breathe sometimes.
Lately, I've been feeling the need to make my body small and still, not move around too much, and keep my voice low. I've been using words I'm allowed to use and just trying to disappear so that I won't be a problem to everyone. But this is getting quite difficult for me to maintain.
I forgot to breathe and when she does that to me, it feels impossible. It's suffocating and feels painful in my head and my heart. I can imagine a wall coming up around me.
I've been constantly subjected to verbal battering and there was never any space for me or my feelings. I was told not to feel, just do what I was told.
I grew up in a controlling environment where I was only noticed and loved if I followed the rules and behaved a certain way. It's like you only get rewarded when you do what they say and there's no space for anything else.
When I was eight, I was a wreck most of the time, but I used to hide it behind a comedy role, trying to entertain everyone like a clown.
When I was eight years old, I felt scared and confused after my family moved into a new place. I struggled to fit in and often felt lonely.
This morning, while I was working, my whole left side of my body locked up, especially my neck. I don't think it's because I slept badly or was cold. It's like my neck doesn't believe my head can take so much pressure, and it's worried that my head might fall. I also experience headaches and anxiety.
I'm worried about how much energy I can give to everything going on in my life, especially because I want to focus on connection and family. I want to take this opportunity to embrace this beautiful gift with both hands, while also keeping all the other things going and juggling everything.
I feel like life has a lot of demands and I'm always worried about handling them. Even though I want to participate in life and cherish it, I've been missing out because of my constant anxiety. I'm constantly checking if things are okay and if I'm doing everything right.
I feel a bit more relaxed saying it, but the words still go away quickly. I feel a bit more determined and bullish with it now. I want to be free to express myself and my feelings, and live a more unstructured life. I don't really need her at all.
I feel like I want to get that jumper, wrap up, and then I'll say that now that's you now. Not me. I'm hesitant, but I want to keep repeating to myself that I am worthy of love.
I am worthy of love. I feel good but tired because it touches a lot of deep stuff.
I feel like I want to go and sit quietly somewhere. What's it like for you when I say I feel you deserved love?
I am struggling with feelings of overwhelm in my life, being a single mother, working hard and having minimal support in parenting my child. Furthermore, I've recently started a new relationship, and I'm unsure about how much I can offer in this relationship and worried that I might ruin it. I'm overwhelmed with the responsibilities of managing my household, keeping my child and dog alive, and maintaining a steady income.
I have been in quite a few abusive relationships and I tend to give a lot, leaving myself open. Although my current relationship is going well, I always have this nagging thought that it's too good to be true, and I keep looking for red flags or potential problems.
I feel abandoned, alone, and unsupported. It's like a never-ending cycle of thought patterns, causing me a lot of anxiety and making me constantly watchful to protect myself.
I struggle with feeling like I don't deserve to be loved and I feel like I'm the only person who can solve my problems.
I feel like there's no one around to help me, and nobody seems to be interested in what I have to say or how I feel. People don't have the time and they're all too busy.
I have this issue where I just stiffen up my shoulders and stay completely still. It feels like I need to freeze my upper body and not breathe.
I'm constantly overdressing and layering on too many clothes, like putting too many jumpers on. It's something I keep doing to myself, and it's strange.
I feel like I don't deserve love and no one's going to stay around. I will always be on my own, and people don't have time for me. They don't want to help or support me, and my son isn't important to anyone.
I was abandoned at eleven days old and spent my entire childhood until the age of four in social services being passed around. I never had any holding or consistency during my formative years, and this makes me feel like I will be left all alone and no one will be there for me.
I was adopted at four years old, along with my siblings, and we were brought to our new adopted family in Somerset. They did their best for us and tried to wear us, but I don't think they had that maternal instinct. They were completely out of their depth, you know.
I think it feels sometimes that maybe I have this imposter syndrome. I think that's the term I read up about. So it's like I'm not worth it. It's about worthiness. And that's the thing, it's just I think life happens and experiences happen. And they sort of compound those ideas. And it's like sometimes just maybe that's why, yeah, I mean, that's it. I don't know.
I'm my voice talking to her, and I'm this voice that says, you don't, you're not worth it, or you don't deserve.
It's really difficult for me to do that because it's just not in my nature to try and push my experience on even myself sitting there. It's like, it's like asking me to go and break it, a kitten's leg or something. I couldn't do it.
I'm having trouble expressing my thoughts and feelings, and I feel like people can say things that they know aren't true.
I used to say to my friends when I talked about wanting a really loving, supportive relationship or wanting an experience of a family or something like that, that it feels like a little African child wishing for snow - like they've never felt it, seen it, or tasted it.
I feel like I'm wishing for something that I know exists in some different place, but I've never experienced or seen it. It feels like a fairytale, something that's not for me, something I need to stay away from.
I feel a bit shy and a little tender. I think I might shed a few tears this afternoon and have a few private moments.
I have gained a lot of strong insights through our sessions, and I am now more aware of why certain things come up in my life. However, until I sat here with you, I didn't really identify some of the similarities between my experiences. I've been told multiple times to start journaling, but I haven't done it yet.
I just wanted to thank you for our session today. I really appreciate your support and guidance in helping me connect with my emotions and work through my issues.
I feel really sad about my relationship with my mother. We didn't experience the love of a normal family as if we were just problems for her. I felt like I was a performing monkey instead of being treated like a human child. I think I deserved to have a mom who loved me.
I kind of feel like this is I don't want to dwell on something that I can't fix and change, you know. I'm trying to feel deserving. I'm trying to sort of fake it till I make it kind of thing.
I say the words with conviction in the beginning, and then I get it's a bit of an awkward feeling at the end.
I feel that if I lose control of my emotions, everything will go wrong and it will be difficult for me to function. I'm afraid I might not be able to pull myself back.
I've never really thought about what I do to my body or emotions physically, but I think maybe...
Recently, I've been trying to make my feelings really small and tidy, as if they have to be contained and not scattered. When I attempt to do this, I can't help but laugh.
I often find myself forgetting to breathe, my child even notices it and has to remind me to take a breath. It's quite embarrassing, but I just can't seem to remember sometimes.
I feel frightened, really disappointed, and unsure. I can't tap into any anger right now, and I'm not sure when the next explosion is going to happen. I'm just feeling the same, and my neck hurts really badly from the tension in my body.
I have this nervous habit of hiding my emotions behind a smile, and I've been doing it for a long time now. I get confused at times.
I have learned to laugh off things to avoid feeling sad or upset. I've been told that if you laugh, the world laughs with you, but if you cry, you cry alone. So now I find it hard to show or share my feelings because I'm afraid of feeling the pain and being alone.
Growing up, I faced a lot of abuse and damage. My parents were never equipped to hold or validate my feelings. We had to behave regimentedly and be good kids, but we were never allowed to talk about our feelings. As a result, I feel angry and suffocated with my voice being silenced.
I feel so silenced that my feelings and needs weren't really important when it comes to my emotions. I grew up with my adoptive parents from the age of four until I was seventeen. My mom stands out for me.
I think I was about eight or nine when I started to feel aware of what was going on, and how everything was bothering me. I want to go back to that time and try to change some of those feelings.
I just feel the same overwhelming sense of fear, like fear of stepping out of line when I see her.
I've been dealing with difficult customers at work, and I've learned to not let it bother me. But sometimes, it's tough when people are calling me names and blaming me for things that are out of my control, like a water main break.
Lately, I have been feeling worried about whether people will treat me well or not. When I try to help others, most of the time they treat me nicely, but there are always a few who don't. It keeps things interesting, but also makes me anxious about the outcomes when I interact with someone new.
I used to struggle with certain challenges in my life and had to overcome them. However, now I feel like it's easy and there's nothing to it.
I would have been a big chicken then. I wouldn't have went to the door. I would have had a real hard time with it. There was one day we couldn't get a guy out of bed, and we had to have his cars moved. I'm pounding on the door pretty loud, but my boss comes down and knocks harder, making the whole house rattle. The guy comes out swearing and everything else at us.
I mentioned to someone that I'll talk to them later and that I'm going back to the job. I just want to see how they handle it.
Sometimes it's hard for me to talk about my feelings and I tend to pull off in a corner somewhere. It has always helped a lot, but I'm wondering if I should share these moments of feeling down with Nancy?
I feel like I need to talk to my partner about certain issues, but it's hard to discuss some topics with her. It's really bothering me, and I just want to be left alone.
I find it hard to talk about my feelings with my wife or mother. When I feel that way, I call Uncle Jerry and talk to him instead.
I had a counselor before who told me that I could call someone during the night if I needed to talk. It helps me just knowing there's someone I can talk to, even if it's not someone I'm close with. Currently, I have Jerry to talk to, but would it be better if I had someone else?
As a patient, I find it helpful to talk to someone else sometimes, as it offers a fresh perspective and helps me gain more insights since four eyes are better than two.
Lately, the relationship between me and my partner has improved significantly. We even went to the county fair together with one of my friends two weeks ago. I feel comfortable about us taking a trip to Vegas together, and I don't consider it a big gamble.
I was at a crowded place when someone in the band announced congratulations for me and my partner, Nancy. She thought I did it, but I didn't know anything about it and was shocked like her. She liked the gesture but was also kind of embarrassed since it happened in public.
I was walking with my partner when my uncle caught us. He mentioned he had heard an announcement about us, which I had no idea about. My partner teased me about it on the way home and I kept insisting I didn't know anything about the announcement.
I've been reflecting on our conversation and thinking about what we've discussed, but nothing specific stands out to me at the moment.
Sometimes I get a little bit depressed, and I don't know why. I'll be going along, and then I'll get depressed for a couple of days. I have no idea why I do that, but sometimes there are days when I hit rock bottom and don't feel like doing anything. However, most of the time, it doesn't last for more than a few days.
I have no idea why I even get into this emotional state. It's just sometimes, you know, I'm happy one day and the next day I'm down in the dumps. I have no idea what brings it on.
I don't experience it very often, but every once in a while, things sort of bottom out for me and it becomes difficult to manage.
I've been experiencing some periods where I don't fully understand what's causing it. I think I need to be more observant and try to identify what's causing these periods so I can correct it.
I've been feeling down lately, and I just wanted to express my thoughts and feelings about my situation. Talking to someone about my problems always seems to help me feel better. So, can you help me understand my emotions and help me feel better?
I was recently dropped off at a lake by some friends to go fishing, and when they returned, they were ready to go and we all had a great time. In the past, this kind of situation could have been problematic, but this time it worked out well because we discussed the plan beforehand.
I've been having issues with communication. It seems like when we have problems, or even at work, it's just the lack of communication. In high school, I couldn't sit down and talk to anyone like I'm doing now.
I was a shy person and couldn't talk to anyone, but ever since I got into the construction business, I have become more sociable and confident, and now I can talk to anyone easily.
I was working in the construction business, and I didn't really know a lot of the people I was working with at first, but I got to know them over time. My boss would put me in charge of public relations, like telling people their water will be shut off. I also had to deal with inspectors and other people who were mad.
I've been feeling really down and overwhelmed lately.
I am struggling with trust issues, especially in my business. I need to trust the person who's watching the banks for me, but if I can't, it could be really dangerous for me. I have a few people helping me watch, but I'm still worried about getting covered up again.
I've had a bad experience before, and I don't want to go through it again. I take a while to build relationships and constantly monitor myself to make sure I'm safe.
I feel like I have a sixth sense. When I'm in a certain situation, like feeling the ground move before seeing it, I can tell that something isn't quite right, even though I don't know how.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and it seems to come to a head sometimes.
I help around the house by cooking dinner and taking care of other tasks. I usually work from six in the morning until nine at night, which is like working two jobs. My wife has realized that I get more done at night than most people do during the day.
I catch heck because I work too much and it sometimes causes problems in my relationship. My partner wants me to visit her more often, but I always have so much work to do, and I feel she's beginning to understand that it's not because I don't want to see her.
I've been struggling with my relationship, as my partner thought that I was pushing her away by working long hours. It took me some time to realize that instead of helping us both, I might be causing more harm.
I was actually hurting her, and then I had to learn, you know, by her not being there and losing what I wanted. I realized that if I keep doing what I'm doing, there's going to be no chance for us. But now, I've learned from it.
I feel like there are things that my partner and I do which we don't always see eye to eye on.
I often have difficulty making decisions, and people around me, including my coworkers, tell me to 'make up my mind' or 'either you're not or you are.' I agree with them that it's very true.
I often take a long time to make decisions. I try to weigh out the situation and figure out the best option, but it doesn't always turn out that way. It makes things tough sometimes.
I try to carefully weigh decisions and consider the options, but sometimes I wonder if I'm better off just going with my gut feeling. When I do that, though, things always seem to go wrong.
I've found that when I try to make plans, they often don't work out the way I hope. It's like somebody throws a wrench in the pile and everything just stops. It's frustrating when I had everything planned out and it doesn't go as expected.
I often find myself thinking about how I should plan more carefully for the future. I'm always trying to look out for everybody else instead of myself, and I don't know why. I ask others what they want to do and tell them that it doesn't make any difference to me either way.
I've been feeling like I've reached a breaking point in my relationship. I just sit around and watch TV in the evenings, and I don't want to keep doing things for my partner without any reciprocation. But I'm also afraid of losing her because she means a lot to me.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed because my friend was pushing me too hard to help her with her work every night after I finish my normal job. I told her I needed a break, and she realized she was asking too much of me, so we took some time off.
I've been feeling overwhelmed with all the work I've been doing at home, like cooking dinner every night and tinkering with things. I eventually brought it up to my partner and asked for a break. I think she realized she might be pushing me a bit too much and didn't want to push me away.
I am close with my friend. She likes my good spirit. I go to her house to help her with work more often than I work at my own home. I tend to get stuff done for others but sometimes struggle with completing my own tasks.
Last winter, I felt like my partner only wanted me around to help fix up their place. This caused some problems, but we eventually talked it all out. They told me they wanted me to be there.
For the past six months, I've been working on fixing my partner's house every night after work. It's been tough because I thought that maybe the only reason she wanted me back was to help her out and fix her house.
I was starting to feel overwhelmed and questioned if the only reason my partner wanted me around was for help. After thinking about it and talking to her, I realized she wanted me there not just for assistance, but for moral support and being together.
I've recently started talking to a counsellor named Scott. During our first meeting, he told me that he likes to spend around 30-35 minutes getting to know his clients and wants to know anything that's bothering me.
I have been struggling with my emotions and thoughts lately, and I am looking for some guidance and support in this session. I hope to gain some clarity and find a way to manage my feelings better.
I struggle with making commitments and decisions. People around me often tell me that I'm scared to commit and tend to hesitate a lot. I'm not sure if it's just my personality or if I'm just too afraid to make decisions.
I've been hearing comments from a few different people lately, and it's making me feel like maybe there is some truth to what they're saying. If it was just one person, I wouldn't worry too much, but since more people are saying the same thing, it's starting to concern me.
I've been trying to improve my relationships and I know they won't be perfect. I'm observant and I learn from my experiences. But, I am worried that we might still make mistakes.
Lately, my partner has been in a better mood because she got a job that she likes. However, there was a time when she would come home and immediately start complaining, which made me not want to go home at night.
I have been facing issues in my relationship with my partner. She would often get home late, around seven o'clock, and if I had stopped for a couple of beers on my way home, she would get annoyed and continually rag on me. I think this is because she was previously married to an alcoholic and it has affected her view on my drinking.
Ever since I came home, my partner has stopped worrying about me being unfaithful. I am not like my partner's ex-husband, and now she knows that I am not out to hurt her. We have discussed this, and she has learned that when I stop for a beer, it's just one or two and then I come home.
Lately, I've been struggling with my drinking habits. I'm not trying to hurt anyone, but sometimes I just want to have a couple of beers and then go home.
As a patient, I feel that I am too observant and often see more things than I should. I tend to read more into situations, and this sometimes leads to problems. My overly observant nature can be both good and bad, but it often gets me into trouble.
I've noticed that I tend to observe and take in more of my surroundings than most people, both at work and at home. While this can sometimes be a good thing, it can also be bad and overwhelming at times.
I am always looking over my shoulder, seeing who's doing what and how they're doing it. I tell people at work that I'm not telling them how to do their job, but just trying to help them out and make them smile, because that's what makes me happy.
I find happiness in making other people smile and laugh. However, some people have told me that there's something holding me back, and I always try to feed off everyone else's happiness. What truly makes me happy is seeing others smiling and having a good time.
I feel like if someone can't have a good time, I don't want them around. I prefer to see everyone smiling and laughing especially at work, because it makes the environment lighter and more enjoyable.
I started having problems with my temper about a year ago, which affected my relationship with Nancy. We have worked through some issues, and I have tried to control my temper. Now, things are much better than they were a year ago.
I've received some counseling here at the college, and it has helped me a lot. I'm not doing the same things I used to do, and I'm not listening to my mother's criticism as much. I turned 30 recently, and I feel like I am becoming more mature.
I have been struggling with some issues, but I've received help from my mom and my uncle. Whenever I have problems, I call my uncle and talk to him. Sometimes it's easier for me to talk to him than discussing my problems with a counselor.
I'm hesitant to talk to Nancy, because I'm afraid that if I say something, I might mess things up and make the situation worse.
I have this problem where my girlfriend, Nancy, tells me to make decisions and when I do, I end up regretting my choices.
I have known this girl for about five and a half years, and we've been pretty much boyfriend and girlfriend during that time. We met when she moved in next door to where I lived.
I have been in a relationship with my partner for quite some time, and we lived together for four years. However, we are not currently living together, but we are working on it, and things are going well so far.
I started dating my girlfriend about five years ago. She had a problem with her previous girlfriend, and they had a fight one night, which resulted in her moving out in just two hours. I helped her during that time by storing her furniture at my grandmother's, my house, and my father's house.
After moving my girlfriend into my father's house, we got a place together and lived together for quite a while. Last summer, we had some problems, and she decided she was going to move out.
I have been feeling down since last fall after experiencing a particularly difficult summer.
I stopped planning too far ahead and just focused on the present moment. I farm in the spring and fall, and for the rest of the time, I just let things happen when they need to. But in the last six months, my communication has improved.
It's just gotten a lot better because we can, seems like, I don't know, I'd say we're both growed up a little bit and we've learned now, we've got to talk to each other to make it work. Cuz she's 39 years old, and I'm only 30.
I am in a relationship with someone older than me and she has more experience in relationships since she's been married twice before. I'm still trying to learn and catch up on what it takes to make a relationship work. Sometimes I get it, but other times I struggle and feel a little slow at it. I'm just trying to do my best with what I have.
Sometimes my attempts to resolve issues in my relationship work out well, but sometimes they don't. This can cause some tension between us, and we try to learn from those experiences. Sometimes, I feel like I push too hard or my partner does.
As a patient, I feel like minor issues often cause the biggest problems in our relationship. However, I remain hopeful because I know we can work things out.
I told her I didn't want to go away, and after a while she agreed and said I could come over without doing any work. Gradually, I got her to come out to my place and help me a little bit. So then it started working out. You know, I'd come up here and help her a little bit and on the weekend or whatever, she would come out and help me.
I've noticed that my partner has been helping me out more lately, like in the garden or with grocery shopping. However, I really hate grocery shopping, especially when I have to wait in line for a long time behind someone who doesn't know what they're doing.
I get really irritated when I have to go shopping for groceries on my only day off and end up standing in line behind someone with a cart full of items. I can cook almost anything, but I just hate the process of getting the ingredients.
Today I had a discussion where we compromised and it worked out really well. I try to learn from my experiences and put them into practical use. I've been attempting to improve my communication and express my concerns better.
I've found that therapy has helped me and even helped my partner as well. Though I feel confident about the coming months, I'm still uncertain of how this progress will continue, as my commitment used to be a concern.
As a patient, I want to share that things have really progressed in my relationship and we've gone to the next level. Everything is going well and smoothly. However, I'm unsure about how I overcame my fear of commitment and indecision.
Lately, I've been lying awake in bed every night and I haven't been able to sleep for an entire week. I tried to tell someone about it, but I don't think they believe me.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed because of a decision I've been thinking about for a long time. My partner thinks it's something I just came up with on a whim, but it's actually been on my mind for quite a while.
As a patient, I feel that my partner sees that I carefully weigh things, even though it can be irritating at times.
I've been feeling uncomfortable when people push me to make decisions quickly. I usually take time to think things through and commit to my decisions, and I have a strong ethic to follow through on my promises.
I've been focusing on making careful decisions and learning from my past experiences. I've noticed that red flags go off in my mind when I'm being pushed to make a decision or go against what I've learned. In my relationship with Nancy, I've learned to communicate better by talking early and often.
As a patient, I feel that the counsellor's suggestion to pay attention to the signs that I can feel confident has been a great help. It has helped me feel more confident and wanting to keep my eyes open for such signs in the next six months.
I feel like I should share my feelings with Nancy, as I've noticed something when she talks to her mother. I'm not sure how to express it, but it means something to me.
I feel that Nancy doesn't appreciate me and I really don't like that. I just want to protect her and make sure nothing in the world hurts her, but she won't listen to me.
I feel like my partner doesn't take me seriously and thinks I'm full of bologna, but over time she's gradually learning and we're communicating a bit more.
Lately, things seem to be going well for me. My partner and I are planning to get married in January or February if everything goes smoothly. She told me that her workplace rewards the highest salespeople with a trip to Vegas, and it seems exciting.
I talked to my partner about getting married, and she suggested that we save money by going to Vegas and let the company pay for it if everything goes right. This sounds good to me, but I'm not completely sure.
I am planning to get married in the wintertime so that neither my partner nor I have to miss a lot of work. I hope everything goes smoothly, but I don't always have a clear vision about where I want things to go.
I have found it difficult to find a suitable time for our sessions, but I've realized that making compromises can work out well. For instance, instead of meeting at 3 o'clock, I suggest we meet at 2:30.
Lately, I've been worried about my friend Nancy and constantly checking on her. However, I've noticed that recently, she has started calling me and wondering if I got home alright.
I don't know why it happened, but she just doesn't communicate with me directly anymore. Now, she calls me and leaves a message on the machine, saying absolutely nothing.
Lately, it has been getting crazy. Everyday when I return home, my girlfriend would leave 10-minute long messages on the answering machine, saying nothing important. She just wants to talk because I'm not home. Now she asks me to call her when I get home.
As the patient, I feel that in the messages I receive, people tend to say a lot to me. Sometimes, this overwhelms me.
Recently, my partner and I have been struggling with our relationship. We both end up being exhausted after work, which affects our ability to communicate and spend quality time together. I know this is the main issue, but I'm not sure how to address it.
I've been struggling with communication issues, but once I'm able to reach mutual understanding with others, the problem usually resolves, and things work out well.
Last weekend, my family and I were supposed to go fishing, but it started raining, and some family members didn't want to go anymore. My mother still wanted to go fishing, but my sister Nancy wanted to go shopping instead.
I wanted to take my friends shopping and then go fishing, but due to the rain, they didn't want to go outside and sit in the rain. This is affecting my plans and I'm feeling disappointed.
I was feeling stressed about a recent change in plans, but I decided to just go with the flow and do what I wanted to do. Surprisingly, it worked out really well. They came back to pick me up at 3:30, and we had a nice dinner.
I have been in a situation where things were going good, but all of a sudden, we've got a problem. I want to find out why it happened and whether it was something I did or just the way things happened. I want to put it behind us and move on.
Hey, you know, we don't intend to screw up but if we're working, it happens. I'm trying to be forgiving about it.
Lately, my partner Nancy and I have been trying to better communicate when we're upset instead of getting mad at each other. We want to understand the reasons behind our feelings, and although sometimes we're successful, other times we're not. Overall, our relationship has improved.
Sometimes, things start getting a little on the edge between me and my partner, Nancy. We both kind of feel it and sense that things aren't going well, but we don't know why.
As the patient, I feel that most of the time, there's just a lack of communication in my life.
I feel like I might be overlooking something in my life, and I just need someone to help me see what it is. I'm open to meeting or continuing our conversations to figure it out.
I found it helpful to just talk, even if it's not about anything serious. It helps me take things off my chest and keep moving in the right direction.
I try to make people smile, but sometimes I don't succeed. However, I have a good time regardless. I think some of my confidence comes from the fact that Nancy is starting to see a little of my humor.
I have been observing some changes in my relationship. I think it's because I am communicating more with my partner, but I also see a change in her behavior which affects my confidence level.
I have noticed that my temper has significantly improved, and it helps me become more committed. I'm getting a lot better with it.
Sometimes I do have a hard time making a decision. I usually talk it out with someone and we'll go from there. I don't know how it happens, but it works out most of the time.
Lately, I've been allowing others to make decisions for me, like where we're going for dinner or what we're going to have. This kind of little stuff doesn't really bother me.
I've been struggling with making major decisions in my life, but I'm trying to work on them together with someone or at least make an attempt.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed and like I need to do more to keep things in control. When we next meet, I want to share my thoughts with you.
I just wanted to share that I am currently feeling relaxed and not doing anything crazy.
I found our conversation really enjoyable, and I can't remember a time when I've had one of these visits where I've laughed and smiled as much as I did with you.
I've been through a lot in the past few years, with the death of my family members and struggles with my partner, Nancy. I know I don't have to always frown and cry, but it's been really hard.
Over the past 40 minutes, it feels like my sense is that things are on the way and that we've gotten a lot better.
I have been married for 11 years and we have two kids, John, who's 9, and Jackie, who's 7. My wife is very busy in her job and has always been a bit of a control freak. Lately, her anger and temper have gotten out of hand. John seems to be handling it okay, but Jackie is more sensitive and not handling it too well.
I'm concerned about the kids and my marriage. It's important for me to keep things together for the kids' sake. There have been a few incidents recently where the kids have been exposed to volatile and angry behavior from my spouse, and I'm worried about its impact on them.
I'm having difficulties in my relationship with my wife and feel uncertain about discussing my personal problems with an outsider, as I was brought up to solve problems myself. But I've realized I need an outside perspective because of the depth of the problem.
I have been trying to solve issues in my relationship with my wife on my own, but I haven't been successful. A friend who's been involved in counseling suggested I should attempt to seek outside help. So, I am here to talk about the deterioration in my relationship with my wife, Angelina.
I've been experiencing a lot of emotional volatility and hostility lately. It's episodic, sometimes happening every day, sometimes once a week, or once a fortnight. There was a specifically bad incident recently.
I find it difficult as there's no rhyme or reason to things, and it's starting to affect my work. Myself and the kids are starting to walk on eggshells, which is an unhealthy environment for them. It's affecting the children and has also spilled over into my work environment, making me feel uncomfortable and sometimes not focusing on my work.
I've noticed that our life has become more peaceful and harmonious compared to before. The kids' lives are not so disrupted, and they're not exposed to intense and negative emotions as much.
I've been experiencing constant and unrelenting distress, both at home and work. My thoughts are nonstop, and I'm always walking on eggshells. When my partner goes to sleep, I stay awake thinking about what I can do to find peace, especially for my kids, as I think they are really feeling the tension too.
I wonder whether maybe I should just leave. Um, so at least the kids can have some peace. Because if I'm not there, maybe Angelina won't have a target.
Those kids just mean everything to me. They're a total delight. But something has been going on between me and Angelina that's causing me distress. A couple of weeks ago, she'd been very busy so I went out of my way to make things easier for her.
I got home from work half an hour late and my partner didn't ask me why I was late. Instead, she went into a tirade of abuse and wouldn't listen to any comments or observations I had to make about it. The worst part for me was that both of our kids were there.
I witnessed a situation where a young woman, Jackie, was upset and angry, and it affected the young people around her. It really broke my heart because there was nothing I could say or do to ease the situation. It kept going until she burned out of anger.
I've been dealing with a challenging situation at home. The kids were very restless and clingy to me that night. They were shocked and surprised. It's been going on for a while, but this was the first time the kids had been fully exposed to the full spectrum of the abuse and ranting and raving.
I've thought about leaving the relationship as a possible solution, but it's a bit threatening for the stability of the kids. I think it's important to do whatever I can to keep the relationship going because the kids will be better off as part of a family instead of me taking off and having to explain everything to them.
I am having a tough time with my situation and I feel like it's going to be so difficult for the kids. However, I'd be really happy to try and improve the situation and move forward.
I think a lot of things have been clarified for me during our conversation. I've gained a better perspective of what my options are and what the downsides of my previous thinking patterns would be. I really appreciate talking with you.
I've been struggling with feelings of sorrow and regret over not telling my father-in-law how much I loved him before he passed away in a hunting accident. We were close and he was always supportive of me, even helping me try to start my own restaurant. I feel sad that I never got the chance to tell him how much I cared and loved him.
I've been struggling with the fact that as a man, I'm not supposed to cry. But there are times when I feel like crying and I just don't know if it would be constructive. I remember when I was younger, I would cry alone and never let anyone see me cry. My ex-wife used to cry all the time and I don't know if it was healthy or not.
I've been trying to cope with my pain by working hard and not thinking about it. However, the sorrow is still there and I really don't know how to deal with it. I gave so much of myself and it feels overwhelming.
I feel like my mind has experienced a deterioration, similar to the way Leukemia affects the body. I believe the culture I grew up in is responsible for this mental cancer. There's part of me that wants to express anger, but my upbringing tells me it's not good to be angry.
I'm struggling with unresolved anger because I can't identify the person who started the whole situation by harming me. These people are sick, and blaming them might not be right. Maybe I haven't given the opportunity for anyone to accept their mistakes. I sometimes smile, but there's still a lot of anger inside me.
I feel really angry lately, even though it's not in my nature to be angry.
I can talk about my leukemia and all the other stuff, but when it comes to the hurt and awfulness that I've suffered, it becomes too difficult for me to discuss. I feel like I have to stop.
I've been thinking a lot about the anger we discussed earlier. I'm not sure if I really want to be angry or if it's part of the process. I'd like to not be angry and skip that part, but I'm not sure I can do that. It seems like my environment or past experiences are pulling me into that kind of trap or system that I don't really like.
I've always felt like there are only two options when dealing with race - either being racist or anti-racist, and I don't want to be labeled. I think I could trust myself better than what's happening in society. The things we've talked about, the culture and people, have caused me more suffering than my Leukemia.
I feel like I have made myself vulnerable by giving too much and by loving unconditionally. I constantly blame others for my problems, even though I know I play a part in them. I feel beat down, and I've never felt this way before.
I've never felt so beaten as I do right now. I think if I show you how much I've been beaten, I'll probably become nothing in this chair. I could tell you sometimes, it would just blow you away. It's really too much for me.
I am having trouble expressing myself. When I finally do start to open up, I just start smiling and drinking water to avoid dealing with my feelings. I know I'm being truthful, but I just can't get past my emotions.
I haven't really thought about the risk of admitting that I've been hurt openly, but now it feels scary, like the fears of being unable to walk and see or having to depend on someone. How can I trust someone enough to show them that I'm hurt?
I don't drink much since alcohol is a depressant for me, but I wish I could express myself better, like admitting that I loved someone and did my best, but it still wasn't enough. I also want to be able to say that I was hurt and defeated, but I don't want anyone to think that they got the best of me, even though the truth is that they really did.
I've been feeling really angry lately, and I'm struggling to find productive ways to express my anger. When I encounter people, they seem to send out certain messages that trigger me, and I feel like they're trying to tell me I'm okay when I'm not really okay. Before, I tried to communicate without alienating people, but now I think it's a bunch of crap.
I'm not sure how to respond to that at all. You know, because a part of that anger is all about the hurt and, you know, maybe if I -- maybe what's happening is if I'm -- if I become angry and I really let it hang out then I really will see how hurt I am. For sure. Um, this -- you know, I keep getting these blocks. You know, when I come to something like that, you know, because, you know, to me that's a revelation and I'm not really sure where that, uh, worse than being angry, I guess, you know. Losing control, maybe.
I've been struggling with anger issues, and I've come to realize that what I'm most afraid of is the hurt I might experience. I don't know if I should or could let go of my anger, as it feels risky.
I remember seeing a movie where the girl threw up green slime. I'm afraid I would look horrible expressing that kind of anger or hurt. I want to keep control for fear of getting sick again. I think letting out all the pain might bring back my illness, but that doesn't sound logical.
I feel so beaten right now, and I'm not sure why. I feel like I need to say something, but I can't. I think that something from my past turned me into something unhuman, and I don't want that to happen again.
I feel like I'm holding out on myself, and I can't let out my hurt because of society's pressure on a man, especially a black man, not to express emotions. I don't know if I have any control over it, but I find myself getting angry at other people's behavior and wanting to protect or fight for others. I'm not sure how to handle these emotions constructively.
I'm just really feeling hurt and mistrustful after my previous relationship ended. It's like when I love someone, it's like loving a pet rock: my love goes out, but nothing comes back, and it took me months to understand the pain and desperation. I'm not sure if anyone will truly understand me, especially after that bad experience with in-laws.
In the past, I tried to share my feelings with my family but it felt like they were far away from my reality. It was really difficult for them to understand me, similar to Dick Nixon not understanding my feelings. I'm okay with loving them but I don't feel comfortable sharing my hurt with them anymore. I think sharing with other people might be okay, but I'm also moving away from the other two, and I don't know if I'm rushing it.
Lately, I have realized that the support I was getting from people around me wasn't genuine. I was hurt by my father-in-law and his family, and I wish I could let them know how they have affected me. But I don't think they would understand or accept my feelings because they don't see me as a human being. I'm hesitant to express my true emotions because I've been hurt before when I opened up.
I've been hurt badly by a lot of people in the past, and it's difficult for me to open up. I'm sharing this with you because I think you might understand. I fear being denied as a person, and I could get angry about it. I don't want to love anyone like I did my father-in-law again, as it was painful.
I am realizing that I have a lot of hope and expectations in my relationships, but I have struggled with the feeling of being defeated and hurt. I don't regret loving and caring, but I wish there was more reciprocity. I'm also afraid to show anyone that I'm hurt and feeling vulnerable.
I've been struggling with feelings related to being a man, race, and failed relationships. I often feel like a victim, and sometimes there's a big lump in my throat, preventing me from getting these emotions out. I've tried to identify what's causing this, but it's difficult. How can I let go of these feelings?
Today feels a bit unreal for me and it's strange since it's the last time we're going to meet up. However, compared to six weeks ago, I feel a lot freer now and there aren't so many past shadows bothering me.
Today's event is important to me, but I feel ambiguous about it. It's sad to say goodbye to someone who's been in my life for so long. There's also a bit of happiness as if I've achieved something and worked hard to know myself better, with your help. I feel like it's about freeing me up to be more me. However, I don't think it's entirely a finished creation.
I am feeling a sense of accomplishment, like I have done something significant and I am graduating.
I feel more relaxed now, and the situation doesn't seem as dreadful as it was before.
I have this big lump in my throat just thinking about endings. It seems like endings are the next thing to deal with. But I believe if we do the work, it will naturally come to an end. I would like to feel complete and excited about what's to come next, rather than feeling like it's incomplete and snatched away from me.
I feel a bit teary, but obviously, it was quite, I was kind of, you know, we had a laugh at the end, so that's good energy. I just wanted to say that I really appreciate that identification that I found now of the fact that for me an ending always means something incomplete. It always means something that I've not been allowed to finish. I don't know what it feels like to end something and have it completed.
I've done lots of work and have really moved on, and maybe it's time to just sort of finish now. But I don't know how to finish therapy, and I feel strange about it. What shall I do, just not come next week then?
I feel like after achieving my goals, I'm just dismissed and it doesn't feel like a proper ending to the therapy. I have been seeing you for almost 18 months now, and every time it feels like our sessions don't have a meaningful conclusion.
Well, I often think about what I will talk about during the sessions, but today I couldn't think of anything I wanted to discuss. Sometimes, if I feel a resistance to talking, it's because I'm sitting on something I haven't wanted to look at, really. Today, I feel like I don't want to be in this room, and I'd rather go out and have a cup of coffee.
I've been working with my therapist for 18 months now and we've dealt with a lot of issues that have made a huge difference in my life. I feel like it'd be nice to have a chat and talk about other things, other than just myself. However, I'm worried that my therapist might think it's time to end our sessions because of this.
I'm not sure what I want in life. I feel lost and confused.
I just feel really, like, if I'm not coming here anymore, then it just makes all of this, um, irrelevant, like it never happened. I can't see a way of finishing it and having it be kind of part of my life. I don't want to let go right now, but part of me feels really kind of stupid and babyish for not wanting to let go.
I've had times in my life where I was uprooted without any preparation or guidance. Nobody informed me what I might need to do, and I wasn't given any rights in those situations.
I feel more equal to you now, I don't feel like you're the person I come to with all my troubles. I want to find out things about you, your opinions, and your hopes and dreams for the future because you're not just the safe place I used to come to when I couldn't deal with things myself.
I feel like we've developed a friendship over the 18 months and our sessions have been really important to me. I've been able to share things that I've never told anyone else, and our sessions have been very creative and valuable. It's a strange relationship though, as it's still a working one and it involves payment. I've come to counseling with specific issues, and our therapeutic alliance has led me to feel more self-reliant and connected.
When I was 7, I had a close friend named Sarah, and our parents didn't support us staying in touch when she moved away. They treated our friendship as if it was insignificant because we were so young. I wish I could have told them how important our friendship was to me at that time.
I get the sense that there are these unspoken rules and structures in counseling that adults use to make things neat and tidy, and I kind of resent that. The 7-year-old in me just wants to ask why and how it came to be that way?
I am starting to trust in myself more and stand up for myself. I realized that the way I see things is just as important as anyone else's perspective. I feel that I have learned this from you.
I feel like I've made progress in our sessions, and I'm ready to stand on my own two feet and trust myself. However, saying goodbye is difficult and I've developed strong feelings of love and affection for you.
I'm feeling frustrated because I came here to talk about how I like to work, but my parents want me to go to school instead. I don't understand why we need to discuss my siblings when I've explained my problem clearly.
I feel like the counselor is really pushing me to get into some areas that are not relevant to my problem. I just want to get a job and not talk about my family. He's asking about my family problems, if my siblings are in school, and stuff like that. I don't see how that's related to my job search.
I'm having some hassles with my family because my parents value education and want me to go to college, but I don't want to go to school for now. We just argue and fight when we talk about it.
I'm living at home and I've been thinking about maybe trying another job or starting out on my own. My parents just want me to go to school, which I don't like. Both my mother and father are against the idea, but my father is a little more supportive.
I don't like going to school and I prefer working instead. My family lets me go to school, but I don't enjoy it. I feel like what matters is what I like to do, not what my family expects from me.
I feel like my brain doesn't work right. I get things turned around, I get opposites confused, and when I write, I get my letters and words confused. I'm also not sure if I'm being paranoid or if people are really after me.
I had a guru for a long time, who said, there isn't any sense in it, what you gotta do to be able to perceive reality is attain a level of consciousness which he offered which I never obtained which is he said, beyond the mind. It's completely above the mind. I never could imagine with my mind, because it's beyond the mind. I suppose it involves being conscious of the universe or consciousness, and I think I've seen you read my mind before.
As a patient, I am curious about the concept of the universal mind and if it is capable of doing anything. Can you tell me more about it?
I don't think so, uh, I think, I think God doesn't know what he's doing. So, who knows, maybe Jesus, maybe Jesus had a mental problem. You know.
I feel like it's unfair that humans have the level of consciousness we do. We're intelligent, but we're only halfway to some place. My friend also said something similar and I think it's really mean.
I think the conspiracy doesn't exist, so I don't think about it. But when people bring it up, it bothers me a bit. Once, Dr. Stumph walked in the room just as I was saying something negative about doctors. He denied hearing it, but I feel like he did.
I'm feeling a bit paranoid lately because I believe people, specifically doctors, are watching me. I don't know why, but whenever I say something negative about them, it feels like they'll suddenly appear around me.
I feel like there's some kind of conspiracy going on. I know it's benign, but it still bothers me that there's a deep plan involving around 7,000 people who have flown in. It feels like a minor conspiracy in the grand scheme of things, but I can't stop thinking about it.
I am unsure about a Bible passage that says to hate your parents. I don't think Jesus actually said 'hate.' I believe it might mean to deny or be happily indifferent to them. If we aren't indifferent to our parents, they'll be interfering in our lives. What do you think?
I haven't gained much wisdom as I got older. My father is a Christian preacher.
I guess I am quite religious, just like my parents who are running a shelter in Michigan.
I don't know how my family feels about me. I wrote them a letter asking if it's okay for me to send a Christmas present, but I haven't picked up their response from the post office yet. I made some crafts for Christmas and wanted to send them.
I haven't visited my parents in years and I don't communicate well with them either. I have my own life to live and I hope they understand that, but maybe they don't. I'm worried they might hate me for being an unfaithful daughter, so I'm not sure if it would be okay to send them a present for Christmas.
I've been struggling with time management and adjusting to a new way of life here. I find it hard to keep up with the strict time schedules, as I'm used to a more relaxed approach. I don't feel motivated and I don't even wear a watch. I've been trying to cope by watching TV to learn about people's behavior and to get some ideas, but I'm still finding it difficult. How can I adjust to this new way of life?
I've been trying to understand how things function and people's expectations around me. I think advertisements and watching TV have helped me realize what is considered good and expected behavior in society.
I'm having trouble adjusting to the lifestyle here since I moved from Fiji Islands.
I've been in America for about three to four weeks now and I'm finding it very different here. People are more individualistic and I think I've been taken advantage of by others trying to sell me stuff. It's an uncomfortable feeling and I don't know how to deal with it.
I'm feeling a bit unsure about this transitionary period in my life, and I sometimes feel like I might be an idiot for allowing myself to be taken for a ride. Also, I'm finding the fast pace and regulation of my new life in this new place quite unsettling.
I've been feeling very uncomfortable in my new environment, so I've been avoiding people and using the media to get a sense of what goes on around here. I haven't met any Fijians here in Hawaii, and I didn't know there was an International Students Office.
I'm feeling quite alone and I'm looking for other people in the same area who have gone through similar experiences as me. I want to get in touch with them so that I don't feel so isolated.
I've noticed my drinking has increased, and my husband has threatened to leave me because of it. I handle most of the childcare responsibilities and don't feel like he does much for me. I don't want to stop drinking, and I'm not sure if it's affecting my children.
As a patient, I admit that I drink alcohol in front of my children, sometimes even getting drunk. But they're pretty young, so I don't think they notice. I also feel like my drinking has gone from casual and under control to really out of control.
I don't really want to be here, but my husband sent me here because he thinks I have a problem with alcohol. I don't have a problem with alcohol; I have a problem with my husband. He gave me an ultimatum and made me come because I had an accident with my car at our house.
I had been drinking when I was driving and have been caught drink driving before. My husband said if I get caught again, he would leave me. He's angry at me because I drink in front of the children and come home drunk. I don't think I have a problem with alcohol, I think I have problems in my life and that's the way I cope.
I feel like I'm constantly banging my head against a wall with my partner, David. He doesn't listen to me, and we're at loggerheads. He told me to come here because I drove home after having a few drinks with friends, and I was probably too drunk to be driving.
I hit the letterbox and pranged our car against a brick letterbox. I've had one charge before and lost my license six years ago for drunk driving. My friend told me I have to clean up my act or I'll lose my license again and it'll be over.
I feel like my husband constantly tells me I'm a bad mother because I drink in front of the kids and come home drunk. But, at least I'm present in their lives, unlike him who is away a lot.
I feel like my husband doesn't take responsibility for our kids and it seems like they're only my responsibility. Everything is always my fault, and nothing is ever his fault. I've started drinking as a way to cope with the feeling that I've taken on more than I can handle.
I don't really want to be here, it's my husband that wanted me to come here. He gave me an ultimatum and said that if I don't come to see somebody that he will leave me. I'm starting to think, let him leave me, you know. I don't really want to be here. He thinks I've got a problem with drinking, but I don't think I've got a problem with drinking, I think I've got a problem with him.
I'm worried about my relationship with my partner, and despite my initial resistance, I've decided to come here for help. I don't want him to leave, as we have two children together and there's a lot at stake if we were to split up.
I see things differently than my partner and I feel like our views on life don't align. I want to keep my family together, but it seems like a constant misunderstanding between us. When I try to talk to him, it's like talking to a brick wall. I'm reaching a point where I can't be bothered talking to him anymore.
I have two kids and my husband doesn't help with them at all. He's always away, and I found that drinking helps me to take the rough edges off things and keep afloat.
I feel like if I didn't go out drinking with my friends, I'd have nothing enjoyable in my life. My relationship with my partner is at a critical stage, but I don't want it to end because I don't know how I'd cope with the kids without him.
As a patient, I have been feeling stressed and tend to rely on alcohol to cope with it. I have been so busy just trying to keep up with everything, I haven't been able to explore other strategies to manage my stress and reduce my alcohol consumption.
I feel torn between my desire to be independent and my obligations to my family. I want them to understand that I am not the same generation as them and that I have my own life. But, I don't know how to make them understand that, and I am in a quandary over which way to go.
As a patient, I often feel guilty and worried about not being independent. In my culture, dependency is a fact of life and is considered to be positive. However, I think I'm becoming overwhelmed by it. Can you help me understand if this feeling is normal?
I'm feeling bad today because I'm having problems with my family. I still live at home, and I want to move out like my friends, but my parents don't listen when I try to talk to them about it. I'm also having trouble sleeping and concentrating on my school work.
I feel hurt and angry when my parents don't answer my questions. I don't think they understand me. I want to move out, but they don't want me to. They avoid discussing it whenever I bring it up.
I feel like my parents don't want me to move out because they want me to take care of them. I don't want to do that for the rest of my life, and it makes me feel trapped. Do you think they see me as ungrateful if I move out?
I've been telling people I want to have a baby and a good marriage with my husband Mark, but I'm secretly taking birth control and forgot to tell him about an appointment change. I feel like I'm unsure if I actually want a baby or a relationship with Mark.
I've been feeling very unsure of myself lately, so I decided to come here to seek guidance on how to establish footing that feels a bit more honest to who I am.
I've been trying harder to be a good Christian wife. I spent a lot of time and effort making meals for my husband, Mark, but he didn't acknowledge or eat them. I talked to my Pastor about it, but it hasn't helped. Recently, I shared a meal with a coworker, and he appreciated my efforts, making me realize how much my husband doesn't notice.
I forgot to inform my husband about the change in his fertility appointment because I was busy cooking, and he got very angry at me. We want to have a baby, but I'm still on the pill due to terrible side effects I experienced six months ago when I stopped taking it. I'm worried about my husband's sperm count.
Without realizing it, you know, uhm, and, you know, uhm, it's, it's a test, a test I think of one's own strength and place where I'm at, right? Like, uhm, and sort of sounds of ripple through you - Uhm, but it's like, oh, okay, we, uhm, you know, this is who I am. Uhm, I need to stay strong in that - You know. So it's, it's a test for me, uhm, I think it's equally, probably a test for others. Uhm, I think I'll always have to-- I think I naturally always try to catch myself in whether or not I'm projecting to, right?
I don't want to be too defensive, but I also don't want to accept things that I shouldn't. I've been open with people who knew me for a long time, especially when I first started coming out and sharing my gender pronoun preference. Sometimes they would mistakenly use the wrong pronoun, and I would let it pass.
I've been facing challenges in my relationship as it feels like my partner is not willing to make a mental switch in adjusting to my needs. This has been difficult for me and it's becoming a part of my process of self-discovery.
As a patient, I feel like this journey with others is reflecting my own inner transphobia. As queer and trans individuals, we all have some level of internal transphobia and internal homophobia because of how society has shaped our beliefs.
Recently, I have noticed that I'm experiencing internalized transphobia, and it happens not only with myself but also with others.
In therapy sessions, I find it effective when my therapist guides me through a stream of consciousness and picks up on issues that we can then explore together. Rather than overtly stating things, I appreciate when the therapist leads me down the path to my own realizations.
In therapy, I've mostly had conversations where things come up with a therapist who is aware of my issues. A good therapist would identify my issues and guide me towards addressing them on my own.
I have had great experiences with my current therapist, but with the one before, who was male, it became sort of parental. There was a moment when he acted very fatherly and said 'no, that's not you'.
I have been feeling like I need to distance myself from certain situations, and I prefer to subtly steer the conversation if it's not going anywhere. Talking about my experiences as a trans person with a non-trans person is something I'm not sure about.
I'm not sure how it would feel to be with someone who's straight. I think it might feel good, but I don't really know.
I've been dealing with a lot of difficult stuff, and it's really exhausting handling all these different things. I try to stay aware of my feelings and manage them, but sometimes it's just too much. I've come here hoping to express these feelings and maybe vent.
I've been struggling with internalized homophobia and transphobia due to societal messages I've been subjected to throughout my life. I realize this is a huge part of my life and it's not something that can be resolved overnight. I'm ready to go on this journey with you to try to unpack and process these feelings.
I feel a mixture of excitement and fear about my current situation. I know it's important, so I'm looking forward to facing it.
I'm out to the other Cis male who I'm close to, who's also a T member. He doesn't really show a lot of emotion, but I was talking about work and my gender identity, and thinking about moving on. However, I'm in a really supportive environment right now and I wonder if it's the ideal place for me to stay for a little longer.
So I took that as the end to sort of let him know and he was like, okay, yeah. He was like so you want me to call me-- call you he wherever. And I was like yeah and, you know, this and that. He was like cool, so he seems really cool and open with it. The other guy who, uhm, is a supervisor. One day, I was just-- it was me and him, it was late in the office. He was like, oh, Jude, you're the last man standing. I was like yup, so I've received support - in that way, uhm, from these Cis males.
I feel lucky to be in a supportive environment, but at the same time, I receive a lot of weird messages, some more overt like in the bathroom situation, and some more covert, like my boss's silence regarding my gender. It's challenging to experience these subtle behaviors that might reflect other people's projections or biases.
As a patient, I would like to share that I am finding it difficult to operate on different levels, which is taking a lot of my energy.
I have been feeling good lately, especially after starting testosterone therapy at the beginning of the year. However, I have been focusing on coming out at work, where I have been for almost five years. I am out to some people there but not everyone, and that has been my journey lately. The environment is open and progressive, and there are more queer folks and a queer ED who's supportive.
I've been passing as a male even though some people might have initially seen me as a masculine female. I made good friendships at work and started to come out to some close friends, asking them to refer to me with 'he' pronouns. One of my close friends, a Cis female Latina, once referred to me with a Latino term of endearment that seemed feminine.
I was talking to my coworker, who's the head of another team, and they were asking about what pronouns to use for me. Some people were picking up on the fact that others were using 'he' for me. My coworker said they didn't know and asked me what I preferred.
I felt relief when she said she would always like to be receptive to me, but you know, I started dreaming stuff up in my head and it became scary. It's a scary thing regardless.
I recently shared something with my supervisor, and it was a relief for me. It has helped to shift our relationship a bit, and now I think she's going to be an ally. But I'm still uncertain if I can fully rely on her.
I have had some supportive experiences in my life, but I still feel hesitant in coming out. I feel like I am at the beginning of a new journey, even though it's been a while. I had an experience that was not bad but different.
I work on a floor with two small nonprofits, and the bathrooms are gendered there.
I had a conversation with someone about the bathroom issue, and they asked if I didn't think about that before making a decision. It was one of the first in-your-face things I had to deal with, and it took me aback.
I had an interaction with someone that made me feel uncomfortable. I know that he has issues with using the bathroom and doesn't like to share the key with other guys in the office. I think it could be his personal issue as well as his gut reaction, but I'm not sure.
I have a friend who is generally a cool and open-minded straight Cis guy. However, I've noticed that he sometimes projects his discomfort with certain things. Like once, one of my co-workers shared a video of a black queer, feminine guy singing a Nicki Minaj song, and my friend became really uncomfortable.
I felt uncomfortable with the video on gender because it made me think about my relationships with my male and female coworkers. I have a good relationship with the males, but the females I'm out to have shown a different kind of support.
I haven't come out to a lot of cisgender males in my office, and it's making me feel a bit uncomfortable.
Lately, I've been thinking about how people perceive me and whether they consider me open, competent, and familiar with various topics. I wonder if their evaluation of me would change if I could show more of these qualities.
I think if I was starting off with a therapist, it could be easy to get defensive if I sense something that I feel is off about the therapy. I don't know, I find it interesting, what do you think?
I sometimes worry that you might misinterpret my need to postpone our calls as me not caring about you or trying to send a subtle message for you not to call. I just want you to know that when I can't talk, it's not because I don't care, but because something pressing is going on at that moment.
Lately, I've been struggling with anxiety when it comes to opening up and being direct with people. I just rated my anxiety as a 4 or 5, which feels somewhat manageable to me. However, I'm still concerned about how to handle the situation if my anxiety increases.
I am feeling anxious about a future event and I've noticed some distortions happening in my thoughts. I want to distance myself and evaluate how realistic they are, and then try to formulate more realistic thoughts to reduce my anxiety.
I recently turned away a friend in need, and it's really bothering me. I've been feeling guilty about it, and I would say that on a scale from one to ten, with ten being the most guilty I've ever felt, this would be a ten.
I was feeling pretty guilty, a nine out of ten. The main emotion that was troubling me was guilt. One of the thoughts I had was that I should be there to help him, and that he really needed me.
I recently received a call from a friend who sounded upset. I feel like I am his only friend and he was reaching out to me for support, but I wasn't there for him.
I'm worried about my friend. He might not hurt himself, but without me, I think it would take him longer to get back to normal.
This week, my good friend who is going through a divorce called me to talk about his feelings, but I was super busy that day. I told him I was busy and couldn't talk at the moment, but after I hung up, I felt really bad about it.
I felt really guilty that he was in need and I wasn't there for him. I was too busy.
I'm feeling overwhelmed by my thoughts and I don't know how to manage them. I could use some help in finding a strategy to deal with this issue.
Whenever I talk to my partner on the phone, I feel like he needs me, and without me, he would be miserable forever, so I should be there for him right now. It's hard to remember that he managed without me in the past and hasn't stayed miserable.
I felt heaviness in my chest and, uhm, I feel really, ah, responsible.
I have been feeling guilty lately because of certain situations where I wasn't available for someone.
I feel guilty because my friend is in misery and I think I am his only friend and resource. Without me, he'll be stuck in his misery.
I have this belief that without me, my friend will be stuck and I should be there to help him.
Recently, my friend was in a really bad spot mentally, and he left a message on my recorder when I wasn't there. I couldn't get back to him for eight to 10 hours, but by the time I got in touch with him, he seemed to be okay. He had managed to bring himself out of his bad mood without my help.
I have a good friend and I don't want to hurt his feelings, but sometimes I feel like I don't want to talk to him. I am having trouble communicating my boundaries without hurting his feelings.
I'm just a little anxious about discussing something, especially when the person is not here. I'm worried about being misunderstood.
I finally managed to say something and let him know that I will be here for him. I want to be there for him whenever he calls, but I'm worried about potential misunderstandings.
I think the idea that I can control some of my thoughts and I don't have to keep thinking the same way is really encouraging to me.
I have realized that I can be direct with my friend without hurting him and letting him know how I feel is a great idea.
As the patient, I don't have any specific issue or concern to discuss right now. I just wanted to have a general conversation, but I'm not sure what to talk about.
Yeah, I feel, uhm, freer. Probably like, I could be a better friend just not responsible and none of the guilt feelings. Hmm. Probably as low as two. There's still a little bit in there.
I used to feel really worried about my friend's well-being, thinking that he's needy and miserable when I'm not around him. However, recently I've started to notice that he has found resources to support himself even when I'm not there. But still, there's a tiny part of me that still feels concerned.
I have been feeling distressed about a situation, and I find my thinking to be crooked. I would like to talk to someone about it, but I keep stopping myself.
I feel like this session has been really helpful for me. I've realized that some of the feelings I have can help me better understand my issues that I never thought were problems before.
I never thought about it that way. I never thought about the fact that him not taking care was probably due to his own fears and concerns.
I have been feeling overwhelmed lately, and I didn't think I had anyone to turn to. After talking things through, I realized that I'm not alone and I have resources to help me.
I find myself not wanting to bother my younger brother, who's in college, with caregiving issues for my father. Although I feel alone, I have a huge support system from my father's side of the family. They want to help, but I haven't tapped into them due to my father's secretive nature and not wanting others to know about his diagnosis.
I have had three sessions with my counselor so far. In our last session, we identified that I'm struggling with feelings of loneliness and being overwhelmed by the recent news of my father's cancer diagnosis. My counselor suggested creating a genogram to identify potential resources within my family, and I have completed it and brought it to this session.
I created a genogram to understand my family better, with triangles representing females and squares for males. My mother's side of the family is from Trinidad and my father's from Georgia. I have been feeling lonely, and I hope this genogram can help me find some of the reasons behind it. My great grandparents on my father's side recently passed away, which is why there's an X through their symbols.
My grandmother and grandfather on my father's side had two sons, and my father only has one brother. Everyone is kind of spaced far apart on my father's side of the family, because they are not very close to us, nor to each other. On my mother's side, however, my grandfather is deceased, and I did not ever know any of my great grandparents. My grandmother and my deceased grandfather had seven children, and my mom is one of them.
I realize that I can't do this by myself, and it's unhealthy for me to continue handling this situation on my own. I know I need help in starting and building relationships.
I feel lonely and overwhelmed due to the distant relationship with my father's side of the family. I wish I could share my concerns with my grandparents, but they rely on religion to solve problems. My mother's side is close, but they see taking care of elders as a responsibility, and complaining makes me ungrateful.
I recently received a diagnosis that I've kept secret from my family, even though we're usually very close and handle issues together. However, I'm realizing now that I need to reinsert myself back into my family unit and draw from that strength.
I'm taking care of my dad who has cancer, and it has caused a lot of changes in our family's life. My mom's retirement plans with traveling have come to a halt, and I'm nervous about the possibility of it being hereditary. I also feel resentment because I think my brother, being a man, doesn't have as much responsibility to take care of our parents as I do, being the oldest and a woman.
I find strength in my Trinidadian cultural background that values taking care of elders as a responsibility. So, I know that no matter how sick my father gets, I won't try to put him in a nursing home or get rid of him. I feel it's natural to take care of my own family. However, my other siblings don't share the same view as me.
I'm actually pleasantly surprised that I can just stop, breathe, and even close my eyes while thinking of the beach and things that make me happy. But am I being an overachiever and always feeling like I need to be working?
I feel like this mindfulness practice is really helpful. I was just looking at the ground and I honestly couldn't remember what I had to do later, but now I feel less anxious.
As a patient, I am having trouble identifying any specific problem in my life, but I've been feeling a general sense of unease and discontent. I'm not sure what to do about it.
I am experiencing anxiety about job interviews. They're constantly on my mind, and I'm even giving myself a deadline. I can't stop thinking about how badly they could go, and I end up feeling really awkward during the interview.
I have been experiencing anxiety around job interviews. I know it's normal, but I just can't help but focus on the negative aspects. There was a time in the past when I felt confident and competent in my job and received positive feedback in Singapore, but now it seems tough to feel that way again.
I remember a time when I felt really confident and sure about myself. I want to be able to feel that level of confidence and reassurance in my body again.
Lately, I've been working eight hours a day, and after work, I spend a lot of time on the TV. I'm not sure if I even like it, but it's become a habit.
Recently, I have started to feel more anxious due to the constant bombardment of news and happenings on the TV. I feel like I am not getting any downtime since both watching TV and working on the computer are activating my brain all day long.
As a patient, I am struggling with anxiety and depression due to being constantly on my phone, the internet, or watching TV. I feel a loss of connection with myself and life because I am never really present in the moment. I recently learned about mindfulness and I'm interested in doing a mindfulness exercise during our session.
I feel like the sensation hasn't shifted much. It's still in my arm and my heart, and sometimes it moves up to my shoulder. I still feel it a little bit.
I feel a bit nice when I just look at the ground and breathe because it's something I don't really do and I never do it.
I've been trying to avoid my anxiety by using distractions like Snapchat or Instagram, but it seems to just make it worse. Should I just try to attack it or acknowledge it?
I feel like my anxiety is a part of me and it's staying stuck in my chest and shoulders because I've been ignoring and resisting it.
I feel really anxious throughout the day, and my alarm clock triggers this anxiety because it reminds me that I have so many things to do. To cope with this anxiety, I tend to pick up my phone and distract myself with social media like Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook.
Whenever I experience anxiety, my heart races and I feel tingly and restless. Even though I try to avoid feeling anxious, I still end up feeling it.
I'm feeling a bit anxious, especially when talking about it. It seems like the anxiety will keep increasing.
I feel anxiety in my heart, stomach, and strangely, my right arm. Maybe it's because I'm right-handed and always doing things with it.
I have issues with someone invading my personal space and I tend to raise my voice and even curse at him to make him stay out of my room. But I feel uncomfortable expressing my anger and frustration like that in front of others.
I'm finding it difficult to deal with my brother Jeff, as he tends to leave his laundry in my room and does other things that upset me. I've been advised to try acting like another person, someone named Carrie, to see if that would help the situation. I'm not sure how he would react because he's so used to my usual behavior, and I don't think he takes me seriously at all.
I am wondering if my family members would think something is wrong if I suddenly started acting calm and collected instead of emotional as usual.
I get angry when I feel like I'm not getting the respect I deserve, especially since I would do the same for others in the house.
I got angry when I saw an awful driver while driving to work.
I get really angry when I see people doing stupid things and endangering the lives of others. It could be on the road, in a store, or anywhere else. I think it's the way I process what I see that gets me so angry, because someone else might not get as angry about the same situation.
I really think that if I could change and become a healthier person with healthier relationships, it would help me in the long run.
Hi, I am a patient and I feel like people around me, especially the ones I live with, are used to seeing me in a certain way. I worry about how they might react if I start behaving differently.
I usually get very angry when I find my brother's laundry in my room, and I start yelling or snapping at him.
I was really frustrated with someone in my room, so I grabbed the laundry and threw it at him, telling him to get out. He was just shocked and asked me why I did that.
I get anxious and lose my temper when someone pulls out in front of me while driving, or when my privacy is invaded at home, such as my brother leaving his laundry in my room. I feel my heart racing and I constantly swear at them, even if they can't hear me. I know I shouldn't do that while it's happening, but it's so hard to control.
I have been struggling with anxiety and anger issues since my teenage years. My parents had separated during that time, and when my father returned, I harbored resentment towards him. Even a harmless comment from him would set me off and make me angry.
I had a conversation with my counsellor, and as we were ending the session, they asked me if they said anything that upset or hurt me during our talk. I told them that I was not bothered at all and felt very comfortable.
As the patient, I have been working with my counsellor and today, they praised me, saying I did a good job. I thanked them for their support and expressed my gratitude for their help.
I have come in to seek advice or techniques to manage my anxiety and stress. I also came in because I heard this meeting experience with you was a good one, and I wanted to take advantage of it.
I've been experiencing increased anxiety, and it's affecting my behavior. When I'm feeling a lot of anxiety, I tend to lose my temper and yell at people instead of calmly communicating my needs. I'd like to learn some techniques to control this.
I often lose my temper when I get anxious, which causes me to say or do things that don't help or may even hurt. I'd like to learn how to control my temper during these moments.
As a patient, I tried out new ways of behaving at home as a little experiment to see what the result would be. I'm unsure if my family would notice or not, and I'm not sure what it would mean if they didn't notice my change.
I am having trouble dealing with my anger and its consequences. I think I need help in understanding what triggers my anger and what leads to it. Can you help me with that? Also, I am not sure about the ongoing counseling work. Are there any three pieces of advice or tasks I can work on?
I'm feeling good, and I feel like I have a goal, the experiment you gave me. It gives me something to look forward to when I go home, and I'm excited about it. The biggest thing I'm taking home today is focusing on this goal as a part of my progress.
I've been working on changing my attitude at home, as we discussed.
I have been dealing with anger issues for a long time now, and I don't like the person I become when the anger takes over. I tend to yell, swear, and have a bad temper. I know it's okay to have anger and express it, but the way I'm doing it is the problem.
I don't know how to handle situations when my brother leaves his laundry in my room, and my family has the same behavior. I want to be different, but I am not quite sure what it would look like.
My father would intrude into my world by, for example, asking why I was watching a certain television show or wanting to watch a game and just turning the TV off without asking. This invasion of privacy would often make me angry, though I know my behavior towards him wasn't exactly good either.
I get really angry when people intrude on my space. At work, when I have to be more in control, I can deal with people who are yelling for some reason, like if the ATM machine outside isn't working. It's not my fault, but I have to bite my tongue and not let the anger out. I usually let the anger out when I'm around my father, brothers, or strangers on the road. There are times when I don't let the anger get the best of me, but I don't think I'm dealing with it in the right way.
I feel like I'm more likely to put my brother in his place if he does something wrong, but I wouldn't be rude with others.
I've been struggling with my temper and aggressiveness, both with my family and friends. It's not as big of an issue with my friends since I'm not around them as much, but I think it might affect my relationships at work too, especially since I recently got a new job.
In my other relationships, making a change would be very helpful. I think this is a good time to try to make the change because it feels like the right moment.
I'm going through a lot of changes myself and just looking into the future, I want to be able to have healthy relationships with all different kinds of people. So, I just feel the way to do that is to learn to communicate better and control my temper which I think is the worst part about myself.
I've noticed that I just impulsively say things without thinking about the consequences, and then I regret it afterwards. I don't like how that makes me feel, and I want to change the way I act.
I've been dealing with this issue for as long as I can remember, which is why I came here for help. I know it's going to be a difficult process to change this part of me, but I'm willing to try.
I think if I could be more assertive and less volatile, I would feel better about myself. I would be more pleased with myself, and I would still want to get all the emotions that I'm having out, just in a different way.
I'd like to be able to do something, and my motivation to do that is good.
I understand the difference and my goal is to be calmer and get my point across without blowing up. I want to try this experiment to talk to the people around me differently and observe their reactions to a calmer version of me.
I've noticed that it doesn't take a lot for me to get angry. For example, if I were to get a phone call and someone asked me to come to a party, it wouldn't make me angry, but in other situations, I get easily angered. Can you help me understand why this happens?
Lately, whenever I'm invited to a party or a social event, I feel like people only invite me out of obligation. For example, I was recently asked to come to a party because they needed more women to attend. This makes me feel appalled and angry, and I don't know how to deal with these emotions.
I live in a household with five other people and their opinions matter to me since they are a part of my life.
I have been feeling unhappy with certain things my brother Jeff does, like leaving his stuff in my room and taking my things. I am willing to try an experiment to address this issue with him.
I have a younger brother who always goes against my words. I realized I always yell at him, and that might be the reason for his defiance. So I'm considering changing my approach and not yelling at him anymore. I think he might actually do what I ask if I stopped yelling.
I've been trying to be calmer and not yell or curse, but it seems like it's making things worse. People around me are still trying to provoke me, maybe even more than before, because they're used to seeing me act out in anger.
I don't want to be like everyone else, but I'm not sure what I do want to be. I don't see myself as Mother Theresa, and I don't want to be that good.
I've had a couple of friends in the past who were able to handle stressful situations pretty well, rarely exploding or getting angry. They communicated better than I do, and I think that helps them in dealing with situations by talking about things instead of just arguing and yelling. I would like to be more like someone who can handle stress and communicate effectively.
I have been struggling with conflicts at home, especially with my brother who leaves his laundry around. I want to be like Carrie, who would calmly and assertively address these issues without using vulgarities. However, the problem is that the people I live with don't seem to respond even when I speak calmly and rationally.
I often find myself getting angry more than I'd like, and I think it might have something to do with my family's communication style. We tend to be confrontational and express our feelings openly.
I live in a household where there is a lack of communication and impulsive behavior. People easily get angry and lash out instead of discussing things. I don't think it's a healthy environment, and I don't like the effect it has on me. I want to change, but it's difficult to get others in the house to acknowledge the issue.
I've been reflecting on what 'nice' means in my life. It takes me back in time when I think of my dad and my memories with him, and it also takes me forward in time with my own children, considering the memories I can create with them. It feels like talking about these things creates a sense of movement through time, from past to present to future.
As a patient, I recently talked to my counsellor about the connections between breakfast and important values in my life. I mentioned how those values fit with who I am and who I'm trying to be in the world, and also the people in my life who are a part of that, like my family members. I also shared the traditions, experiences, and stories that go along with this for me.
I didn't agree with some things and there are differences that I can tell stories about. I am unsure about where my values will lead me, but there are so many possibilities and I have some ideas that I hope will ultimately lead to goodness.
I express my values in little ways with my own family and in other things as well, and I'm here today to share and explore that further.
As a patient, I've been talking about my studies and work, and I think it's been nice to share these things with you.
I think it's amazing how like one conversational theme can go in so many different directions. I'm surprised at the different pieces of me that came out from just one question.
As a patient, I would like to mention that my Dad used to be the main cook in our family. He would prepare large meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I have fond memories of those times when our family, including my brother, would enjoy these meals together.
Now, breakfast is kind of on the run. Sometimes I'll have a bowl of cereal in the morning or, like this morning, I had to stop at Del Taco and have a breakfast burrito with eggs and cheese. Life has changed, and the patterns of life have changed a little bit. For my kids, I do make sure that I provide them, at least, with something to eat. I don't make the large meals just because of time. It's just because of the crazy scheduling right now in my life with managing school work and everything like that.
Recently, I've been feeling stressed about the uncertainties in my life. I don't know where things are headed, and that makes me anxious.
I really enjoy having breakfast in the morning because it gives me energy and helps me sustain through the day. I grew up having large breakfasts with my dad, so it's been a positive experience for me.
When I was younger, my dad would make breakfast for me, which included an egg, beans, and a tortilla to scoop up all the deliciousness. It's a really nostalgic and comforting memory for me.
I feel like family is really important to me. I feel like giving quality time to my children is really important. I consider myself and my husband especially too . . . We're very hands-on parents. Hands-on parent is just that we're involved in their activities, we're involved in their lives, you know, um, we're both very attentive to them, both very nurturing to them.
I like that I can give values and characteristics to my children, such as nurturing, being attentive, and showing consideration for others. I believe that they will carry these traits into society, and it's important for me that my children contribute to a larger spectrum. This comes from my dad's influence and the values he instilled in me, like work ethics and making sacrifices for the future.
I want to get back to the kind of environment my dad created for me because I loved it. I like the idea of family and eating meals at a table. My husband says that food brings people together, and I really believe it does. It creates conversations and good feelings.
I have been talking to my partner about our current living situation. We live in a really small space and it's affecting our daily lives. We don't even have a dining room table because it wouldn't fit in our place. We want to provide a better lifestyle for our children and create lasting memories for them, like having a proper space for dinner.
I just feel like my purpose is to give myself in a positive way whenever I can, and I think being a part of this helps others learn valuable skills and add to their own bag of tools.
I think it's just like my past and what I've experienced. There's been both good and bad, so I know that I don't like the bad. I didn't like to experience that, and I know if I can impact someone else's life, I would like that. I like humble people and gravitate to those who can see the good in others. I guess my experiences have molded this.
I've been thinking about how my daily routines, like having breakfast, connect to a larger picture of me as a parent, and wanting to live in a way that contributes to society. This also relates to the values I appreciate in my dad's life and how he's stood for certain things.
I just talked about some deeply personal experiences with my counsellor and I feel really grateful to have had a significant figure in my life during difficult times. It makes me emotional in a good way, like I feel a sense of relief.
I feel a sense of pride when I think about my dad and the values that he instilled in me. I try to pass on those values to my children, especially during breakfast time. I believe that these values have influenced other aspects of my life and even being here is a result of that.
I want to live my life in a way that contributes to society and is not just selfish. I appreciate my Dad's values and how he has stood for them in his life.
I've been keeping track of my weight because it just happens, and I don't know what to do about it.
I see what you are saying, but I'm sure most women do some of this stuff. You know, if I think of my friends, I'm very sure that most of them check their shape in some way. But maybe not with tape measures around their thighs.
I think the conversation was good because you acknowledged that it's normal to do certain things like measuring thighs, but you also pointed out that I might be doing it a bit too much which made me feel more at ease. You also mentioned that I might have too many mirrors and might be using them in the wrong way.
I really want to talk about Sunday. I'm quite worried about this since I'm coming towards the end of treatment, and this is still happening. What does that mean? Am I really getting better or is this going to carry on? Sunday was a rubbish day, and I was in a bad mood with no plans.
I felt awkward talking about how I scrutinize my body in the mirror, but the counselor seemed understanding. I asked if this was normal and if others do this too. I admitted that I thought it was the only way to find out if my shape was changing, but I also didn't know how to change this behavior.
I mentioned to my counselor that I thought everyone does the things I do, but they pointed out that some of my actions might be a bit unusual.
I always try to not touch the seat with my thighs and sort of look at my thighs to see whether my shape is changing and whether I have become fatter. How else am I going to find out whether my shape is changing or not?
Lately, I've been struggling with certain behaviors that seem so automatic, I don't even think about them. How can I change this?
I like feeling in control like everyone else, but when I visit my relatives and can't control my eating, I hate it. My work, life, and relationship with Jim feel out of control as well. I'm not sure if my restricting eating is an attempt to gain control. What if some of the issues that I have are just a part of my personality and won't change?
I recently started practicing something to gain control over my emotions, and it felt relieving to hear that it's normal and good. However, I still feel worried that these overwhelming emotions could happen at any moment. By the end of our last session, I felt less hopeless as I could understand the triggers.
I didn't realize that my behaviors on Saturday affected my problems on Sunday. I started to behave differently on Saturday, by not eating and going to the gym without having a snack. It was only after we discussed it that I began to see that my thinking and behaviors might be connected.
I found the analogy you used a bit abstract at first, but as you explained it in more detail, it made more sense. I understood that something can trigger off this way of thinking and feeling. However, by the end of the session, I wasn't completely convinced that I could learn to influence this mindset.
I feel like a nervous wreck at the moment. I feel anxious all the time, and my relationship with my partner is being affected by my eating issues. I want to eat by myself. I've been like this for a long time, keeping my weight stable, but it's affecting my work and relationship.
I'm trying to identify triggers that make me want to turn to unhealthy habits, like skipping meals or body checking. I want to feel more in control, and I think being more aware of what's triggering it is probably going to help.
I recently experienced a dreadful Sunday and when I shared it with my counsellor, they reacted differently than I expected. I thought they would be panicking or worrying like me, but instead, they found it interesting.
I've been struggling with controlling and restricting my eating. I know I need to deal with the issues in my life that are causing this, and I'm concerned about my shape and feeling out of control. But, I'm not sure how open I am to discussing these things.
I started to feel very uncomfortable when the conversation connected to my weight, eating habits, and health problems. I didn't want to talk about it and I felt like they pushed me off when I mentioned my undereating, low weight, infertility, and other health issues.
As a patient, I feel like the counsellor stepped over a barrier when suggesting I might be controlling my eating because my life feels out of control. It made me feel awkward and uncomfortable, but at the same time, I knew there might be some truth to it.
I don't know if I can cope with gaining weight. If I put on all this weight and feel the same as I do now, I might just lose it all again.
I spent two hours at the gym instead of my usual half-hour. I just felt like I needed to be more careful with my eating and exercise routine, even though I wasn't worried about it before. On Saturday, I talked to a friend from school on the phone.
I recently caught up with an old friend who told me about her new diet, and it got me thinking about my own eating habits on weekends. I just want to make sure I'm not overdoing it and want to be more careful.
I found the exercise of writing down every time I checked my shape over two 24 hour periods to be quite revealing and a bit horrible. I noticed that I spent a lot of time touching, pinching, and checking my stomach, as well as looking in the mirror frequently. I was unaware of some of these habits, and it was shocking to see how much time I actually spend on this. At work, I am very conscious of my appearance and even go to the restroom multiple times to check how I look.
I look at myself in the mirror and focus only on my thighs, bottom, stomach, and hips. I don't like my shape, and I keep checking myself and looking for problems. I'm constantly dissatisfied with my shape, so does that mean this dissatisfaction is caused by the way I look at myself?
I was asked to record every time I checked my shape over two 24-hour periods. I was astounded by how much I do it, and it was embarrassing. Telling you about this felt awkward.
As a patient, I think I have too many mirrors at home. I have six in total, including one in the bathroom, two in my bedroom, one in the guest room, and another one at the bottom of the stairs. Some of them make me feel fat and I feel like I probably don't need all of them.
I have this habit of looking in the mirror and only focusing on the parts of my body that I'm dissatisfied with. I tend to scrutinize those areas and ignore the rest. This seems to have a strange effect on how I perceive my body.
I have been experiencing some tension, especially when it comes to the areas of eating and weight. I am aware that I need help, but I also hope for some positive changes.
I think the more you brought the things together like the eating, the weight, and how I'm feeling in my life, the less possible it was for me to steer the topic back to my life and my problems. It got more difficult for me. Hearing about others who have gone through the same and how their life and personality changed gives me a bit of hope.
I went to my friend's house to watch a film and cook dinner. After the film, we had some ice cream. Since then, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, I've been fine, just worrying a bit about what happened on Sunday.
I have had three or four weeks of things going really well, but then last Sunday was awful. Things have been fine since, but I am really worried about what happened on Sunday. On Saturday, my morning eating was normal, but I had diet food for lunch and skipped my mid afternoon snack.
I am not sure if my Saturday evening was food-free, but looking back, it does feel like my old days when I used to have good days with my eating habits. I am not sure if I was too busy to have a mid-afternoon snack.
I'm worried about my relationship with Oz and his behavior. He's set in his ways and it feels like I can only look forward to the status quo, where I take care of the house and everything without any help from him. I'm tired of it and I want things to change.
I love my husband, but if there's no working together in our marriage, I don't see the point in staying together. I'm considering divorce if things don't change, as I feel that my needs and expectations for the relationship aren't being fulfilled.
I hope my husband and I can work things out, but I need some cooperation from him. I'm really questioning his ability to make changes.
Lately, my partner seems to have changed. He used to be honest, laid back, sensitive, and caring but now he's just having fun by himself, being insensitive, and downplaying things. I'm not sure what's going on.
I've been given a dysfunctional thought record sheet by my counsellor to keep track of my automatic thoughts, emotions, and situations that lead to these thoughts. I'm not sure how to get started or if this is in the book I've been referred to.
I hope my partner can change, but I don't know. I feel like his attempts to change are just lip service. I keep asking him to do things, but it feels like nagging.
I feel unappreciated and taken for granted. I think my partner doesn't love me because he doesn't show effort or demonstrate that he cares.
I feel frustrated because my husband, Oz, undermines my parenting efforts with our son, Timmy. I am the one who spends more time with him and I have to be the disciplinarian, even though Timmy is generally a good kid.
I'm the one who takes care of everything, but I feel like my partner undermines my efforts by being uninvolved and even undoing the work I do.
I've been asked by my counselor to work on the first three columns of a thought record, which includes listing the situations, my automatic thoughts and emotions that come up. I don't really have anything else to say, but I'm willing to work on it.
I feel a bit confused with this conversation between the three of us.
I find it hard to disconnect worry from certain situations, and when my therapist suggested moving my worries to a designated time, I felt uncertain about it. I want to learn how to respond differently to my worries and redirect my focus.
I have a daily worry that I won't be able to get the kids' lunches made, and they'll go to school without a lunch. I understand that worries are anticipations about what could happen.
Lately, I've been feeling really uncertain about my decisions. I think I'm only about 20% confident in the choices I've made.
I constantly worry about everything that's coming up in my day, from getting my kids off to school, making their lunch, going to work, and dealing with traffic. It feels like it never really stops, and my worries are focused on the very next thing I need to do.
I find myself worrying about various things when I try to make lunch, like what to make, if I have enough time, if it's nutritious, and if it'll spoil. These worries just come up without planning, and I feel like I have to deal with them. My usual response to these worries is trying to prevent whatever I'm worrying about from happening.
I am struggling with constant worry and I usually can't let it go. I just get caught up in it and can't help it.
I'm afraid I may be fired at work because I don't clear my desk of all the clutter at the end of the day. In our last session, we pinpointed the problem and discussed possible solutions. I remember the options were to do nothing and let it go, ask my coworker Mary if I could get fired for leaving my desk messy, or talk to my boss. I decided that talking to my boss had the most benefit and the least downside. How do we go about implementing that solution?
I have been feeling anxious about talking to my supervisor, Chuck Bailey, about a question that's been bothering me. I'm worried about how to approach him and initiate the conversation.
I feel stressed about not being able to make lunches for my kids. There's about a 20% chance of it happening and if it does, it would be really bad, like an 80 on a scale of 0 to 100. The most likely outcome is that I manage to make the lunches, but if I don't, my kids would be hungry and might struggle to concentrate at school. This makes me feel guilty.
I'm struggling with worries about not making lunches for my children. I've never stopped to think like this before, but I realized that there is a 20% chance of not getting the lunch made. However, I've always somehow managed to make the lunches for my kids.
I've had this particular worry hundreds, probably thousands of times, and it has never been true.
I had an experience recently that I'd like to discuss in our next session. I'll make a journal entry about it, so we can go over it together.
I had a pattern in my life that helped me focus and stay motivated. Recently, I lost that pattern, and now I'm struggling to get out of bed and be as productive as I used to be. I really want to get back to that state where I rushed to the library and made sure I was in line.
Sometimes when I'm writing, I'll spend days on a paragraph and I feel such despair. I'm never able to make it come together.
As the patient, I've had a conversation with my counsellor about our relationship in therapy, whether I felt heard and understood, and whether the approach we're using is a good fit. They asked whether we were accomplishing what we're here for and if everything made sense.
Recently, I have been feeling overwhelmed with work and my stress levels have been high. I rated my overall stress level as a four and an average of three in other areas.
I have written the number twelve on a piece of paper and measured each line as 10 cm. long. I am not sure if I should keep the paper or if you should keep it.
I remember last time when you showed me the graph, I had scored a 10. This time, however, I have improved my score and it's now 12. I think I'm doing better.
I feel like I'm closer to the line, and over the past three days, I have experienced a smidgen of improvement in my situation.
I've been trying to identify patterns in my life, but I am having difficulty finding any. I'm not sure if I'm just not looking in the right way or if there really isn't a pattern there.
I've been feeling really lost and overwhelmed lately, and I'm struggling in my personal relationships and social life. Sometimes, I just don't know what to do. Can you help me understand what's going on?
I have my paper with me and I'm not sure about the scoring system. Can you help me understand what a score of four would mean?
I have been facing some issues in my relationships, especially with my family and close friends. I feel like there is a gap and I am not able to connect with them properly.
I just haven't been getting up in time for work lately, and I've been staying in and missing it because my boss won't wait very long for me.
I have been spending a lot of time working on my research, but I feel like it's not leading to any concrete outcomes or creations. I had hoped to create something meaningful from my effort and I am frustrated because it feels like it's all for nothing.
I wanted to share that two weeks ago, I went in with this idea that I had a lot of stuff written down, because I write stuff down. And I thought I saw a pattern and felt like it was all going to come together. I was so invested that I spent the whole day working on it and even stayed in the library till they announced it was closing time.
I was almost there and then I had to leave. The next day I couldn't get back to where I'd been and I couldn't see the pattern anymore. So, I just went home that day. I took a day off, but the pattern still wasn't there. I just know if I had just 30 more minutes, I would have had it, but I can't get it back.
I stay at home waiting to see the pattern again. But when I do see the pattern, it's going to be too many hours to make up on the work, and it's important.
I feel uncomfortable sharing my progress with others, and I am hesitant to fill out a form assessing my emotions and situations in various aspects of my life over the past week. I don't think I want to fill it out.
I have some concerns about filling out a form because I don't know where it came from or who had it before. I have been told about where it will go, but I'm still unsure about its origins.
I'm feeling very concerned about where this paper might have been and who's touched it. It's making me feel uneasy.
I am relieved and grateful that you were able to help me with the issue I was dealing with, but I'm not sure how I would rate my progress on a scale from zero to ten where ten is the best.
I'm glad I found this clinic, a friend of mine told me about it. They said you've been in this neighborhood for about 17 years and offer free help to people. I don't know much about the clinic other than that.
I attended a counselling session today. The therapist, Scott, talked about how therapy doesn't need to take years or even months. He introduced a brief form meant to help me stay on track in four different areas of my life and asked if I wanted my name on it. I preferred to keep my name off the form and asked where it would go after we were finished with it.
You know, I didn't explain that very well.
As a patient, I would rate my progress as a three out of ten. I was at a 10 when we first started working together, but my scores haven't improved as much as I had hoped.
I'm trying to understand the process here, and I am curious about the lines that you mentioned. Can you please explain the significance of them?
I recently did a self-assessment, and my score was below the cutoff point, meaning that I need to talk to someone and make some changes in my life. I'd like to feel better and hopefully have my scores go up over time.
I'm feeling like a 3 out of 10 individually, but my relationships, particularly with my family and close loved ones, are more like a 1 out of 10. I do my own research and work alone, so I don't really interact with a lot of people.
I have been working alone and doing some research on my own.
I have been avoiding social interactions lately and spending most of my time in my office doing research and writing. I often go to the library and use books or the computer for my research.
Lately, I've been feeling down about my social life, work, and other aspects. When it comes to work or school, friends, and my research, I would give myself a three out of ten.
I've missed six days of work in total, four days last week and two days this week. This is quite unusual for me. I remember mentioning to you two or three weeks ago that things were going differently, especially when I have work.
I often sleep in, especially when I don't have regular work. I do temporary work at Home Depot, heading down there early on workdays to get hired for the day.
I found a job where I go to this place at six in the morning and do various tasks like loading drywall. I learned about it from my friend Jacob, and we go down there together.
Some mornings there are guys coming in and they're picking up supplies, and they just need extra hands, so they hire me for the day. If they don't hire me, then I still have to go work and I go to the library. Some days, some weeks I work every day.
I am worried about finding transportation to work if Jacob and I don't get hired at Home Depot. If Jacob gets hired and I don't, I can take the bus and train to the library for work, but if neither of us gets hired, I'm unsure how I will get to the library.
I don't know what Jacob does during his work every day.
I thought when I talked to Jacob, there would be something I could do to get back in touch, but I didn't get enough direction. I also don't have a lot of friends and don't feel good talking to new people right away.
I still need to feel better with you. When that happens, it will be higher. It's just that I don't know you, but I do feel comfortable here.
I feel like I need more time to get to know you before opening up completely. I think it's important to be cautious and take time to understand people because first impressions may not always be right.
Lately, I feel like I lost my focus on my research. A few weeks ago, I felt a strong grasp on the patterns and connections, but now everything seems out of reach. The harder I push myself, the more I feel frustrated and stuck.
I felt only partially heard, understood, and respected in my relationship, around a five on a scale of zero to ten. However, I feel that we worked on and talked about what I wanted to talk about, which would be a ten on the same scale. My research is very important to me.
I rated the therapist's approach as a 5 out of 10, and today's session as a 7 out of 10. I feel that there's something missing in the session, but I can't exactly pinpoint what it is. Overall, I'm still unsure if this approach is perfect for me.
I feel like there were a lot of questions during our session, but I still don't know how to get back to my research. Also, it seems like I need help with the approach or method in order to feel that the session is right for me.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with my job and family responsibilities. I'm constantly tired, stressed, and unable to focus on anything. It feels like everything is falling apart, and I'm not sure what I can do to regain control over my life.
I decided to come in today because I've been doing my research every day and felt like now is the time to talk to someone about it.
Last week, I didn't go to the library at all, even though I had time on certain days. Now, I am getting behind on my research, and I can't catch up because I missed four days.
I've missed two days this week and I'm even further behind, I don't know why. I talked to my friend Jacob, who's been here before. He said you were able to help him go back and do what he was doing when he couldn't do it anymore. He also mentioned that it didn't cost anything.
I'm really stressed about falling six days behind on my research, and I'm not even sure how to get back on track. The research is very important to me.
I have noticed that my father-in-law is a lot like my husband. When I tried to talk to him about some issues, he simply told me that's just the way she is. He never says anything and would do anything for us, but he never disagrees or confronts her.
As a patient, I am struggling with setting boundaries with my child's other parent. I have made it clear that if she wants to have anything to do with our son, I need to be included. I went through pregnancy and labor, and I want to enjoy my son with her. However, I'm not sure how to navigate this situation and maintain some form of control.
I recently had to put my foot down with my parent about my son, their grandson. I told them 'He's your grandson. He's my son; he's your grandson.' But I didn't feel comfortable and I felt like I was being rude.
I'm upset because even though my mother-in-law is a horrible person to me and my husband, he still loves her because she is his mother. This situation bothers me, but it bothers me more to see my husband not being able to see his parents.
I'm struggling with trying to be respectful of my partner's feelings about his mother, but I don't want to limit when he can see her. I would hate if he ever did that to me with my mother.
I don't want to be the bad guy in whatever decision I decide to make, but I also don't want to be abused. My partner never goes to see his mother, she comes to see him, and this bothers me.
It's so hard for me to feel like an adult because my parents taught me to give others respect, and I still feel like a child. It's hard for me to stand up on my own two feet.
I have a large family and they are very involved with me and my son. My partner feels intimidated by this and it causes issues. For example, at my son's first birthday party, she left early after he opened his gifts because she didn't want to stay with the rest of the family.
I think my sister-in-law might be intimidated by my family. After a recent event, she only interacted with my family when no one else was around. I've been considering catering to her needs by planning separate events for each side of the family, but that's more work for me.
I have an issue with my mother-in-law, and it's challenging to handle her visits. I think she doesn't like the idea of family gatherings where both families come together. I need some advice on how to manage her visits and make them more agreeable for both of us.
My husband says that his mother and I are alike, and that's why we can't see eye to eye on a lot of things. He believes that she wants the best for him and tells me to let her words go in one ear and out the other, as he does. However, she often puts him down, and he doesn't even realize it.
I have a friend who constantly puts someone down, saying that he's overweight, lazy, and too picky about his house. She never praises him or me. There was only one time she praised me.
I feel sad because the only compliment I've ever received from my mother was on my wedding day, when she said that I looked beautiful. She usually follows the rule of not saying anything if she doesn't have something nice to say, but she'll speak her mind.
Whenever I have a disagreement or fight with my husband, my mother-in-law never supports me, even when I am right. She always speaks out when there's something bad about me, but when there's something good, she doesn't say a word. My husband doesn't quite understand my situation, and I feel all alone in this.
I really thought that the grandparents would be more involved with our lives after the birth of our child but they rarely visited in the first year, even though they live nearby. This past weekend, they came for an unexpected visit and I was not prepared for it; I don't like surprises.
I feel frustrated because my husband's family changed our holiday plans last minute and wanted him to go to Tennessee with them for Thanksgiving. They didn't invite me or our son, and it feels like they don't want to be involved with us normally.
I've been experiencing some conflict with my husband and my mother-in-law. She often ridicules me and my husband, but he was raised in that environment, so it doesn't bother him as much as it bothers me.
I've been feeling hurt because my spouse's mother told me that I'm not good enough for her son and that I don't take care of him enough. This happened when we were planning our wedding.
I was discussing an issue with you and was trying to pass the responsibility by saying it was Ed's idea. I'm not confident in handling it myself, and Ed doesn't want to do it either.
I feel like I need to take a stand and make a decision for myself, but I'm worried that my mom will never approve of me. Although I know how to do it, I'm still anxious about what might happen.
I have been struggling with my relationship with a person who has been using bully tactics. I think all I really want is their respect, and I'm not sure how to achieve that.
I had a conversation with Ed, where another person was present but only able to hear my side of the conversation. Ed and I had talked in advance, so he was aware of the situation. However, I'm worried that the other person might come back and twist my words against me.
I'm having issues with someone distorting conversations that I have with them. I often find myself trying to figure out what really took place and how to clarify the situation.
As a patient, I think it's a good idea to call someone and set some ground rules before getting into a situation. I would probably discuss it with my husband first.
I've been discussing a situation with someone, and we're trying to decide if he should be the one to call and tell another person about our decision. I want to make sure he's in agreement with that, but I'm not insisting that he should make the call if he doesn't want to.
Lately, I have been having issues with my mother-in-law, and she thinks that I am not good enough for her son. When I tried to discuss it with her, she got really offended and called me cruel and rude. Even though my husband agreed with me, he didn't feel comfortable calling her himself.
I feel like I probably ruined it. I think they wouldn't have anything to do with it, and it's probably going to come back in my face. Ed is going to say that I hurt his mother's feelings, and I shouldn't have done that, even though we had talked about it. Sometimes she'll twist things to say I said something different than what I actually did.
I tend to confront her over the phone, and I'd like to have Ed listening on the other end so he can hear the conversation.
I feel really upset about the way my daughter-in-law is being treated by her family. It feels so inhumane. The whole situation has caused me a lot of distress.
I have had problems with my husband in the past, and even though we try to be friendly now, the underlying tension is still there. I once confronted a family member that I didn't feel a part of the family, but it didn't seem to register with them.
Whenever I try to talk about something with my mother-in-law, she immediately changes the subject. I can't do or say anything to make her understand, and I'm struggling to accept this situation while maintaining my sanity.
As a patient, I can't quite understand what Dr. John Krumboltz wants from me, we just had a conversation and it seemed like he wanted something but I couldn't figure it out.
I have been struggling with dealing with my mother-in-law lately. I find it difficult to communicate with her and it's causing me stress.
Well, family time is really important to us, and with my husband, Ed, putting in all the extra hours, we seldom get to see one another and weekends are our only time. It just seems like my father-in-law is coming over quite often and sometimes forgets to give us a call to let us know he's coming.
I feel frustrated when you come over unannounced because it messes up our schedule, and it's hard for us to make plans. I was wondering if you could possibly start giving notice before coming?
I'm struggling with my relationship with my mother-in-law, and I need some guidance on how to communicate with her more effectively. My counsellor suggested that we try role-playing, with me being my mother-in-law and the counsellor being me.
I feel more confident when I have conversations over the phone.
I'm feeling down today because my back is bothering me again.
I unexpectedly drop by at my friend's house often and now my friend, Dr. John, is suggesting that I should call in advance to check if it's a convenient time to visit. He wants to make sure it's mutually convenient for both of us. I am surprised that he feels this way.
I have a family member who doesn't seem to have a healthy perspective on our family's growth. No matter how much I try to cater to her and please her, things don't seem to improve.
I feel so frustrated because I think I can't accomplish anything. There's this person who doesn't seem to be affected by anything and I don't think she even realizes or understands what's going on.
As the patient, I feel that emotionally, this person knows they can get to me and manipulate my emotions.
I've been having problems with my partner, and it's been hard for me to distance myself from him. We were building a new home and had to find temporary housing for six weeks, but my parents could not accommodate both of us.
My partner's mother refused to let me live with them for six weeks. So, we went our separate ways - I stayed with my parents and he stayed with his parents for six weeks. It took us about three months after that period to come to terms with what had happened.
I recently got married and my mother-in-law used to drop by our house without any prior notice. I didn't appreciate it as I like the house to be presentable when someone visits. So, I told her that we're a young couple and might be doing something, so I'd appreciate it if she could call before coming over. We also gave her a key, as my husband thought she should have one.
I've been having issues with my mother-in-law, who used to have a key to our house and would just let herself in without any respect for our privacy. We ended up moving 30 miles away to try and create some distance.
I recently moved further away from my parents and it has helped me a lot.
I am trying to think of solutions for a particular issue in my life. One thing I would love to happen is for my husband to take charge of the situation and lay the law down. However, I know that's unlikely to happen.
I was in a conversation with someone, and I knew full well what she was saying, but I confronted her because I didn't like it.
I've been struggling with my relationship with my family, and I'd really love to have no relationship with them at all. However, I know that it's not possible. I just don't know what other alternatives I could consider to deal with this situation.
I think it's important to have boundaries when dealing with my difficult mother. For example, she should only call me when it's convenient for me, and not drop by unannounced. Visits should be planned in advance, just like a phone call.
I am struggling with handling my family members who used to live in the same town as me and would frequently visit unannounced. I am not sure whether I should do something about it or just let things go the way they are.
I'm feeling overwhelmed with the possible alternatives for managing my relationship. I've considered various options, like having no relationship, setting ground rules for planned visits, or leaving things as is.
I've been considering different ways to deal with a difficult family member. Persuading my husband to confront the issue seems impossible, but I think using my own family as a buffer and having them over at the same time as the difficult family member could work.
I've been considering setting ground rules for planned visits, which may include my family. However, I'm unsure if I should do it every time or not.
I find it hard to set up ground rules, especially when it comes to asking people to call me beforehand.
I've been feeling jumbled and conflicted, everything seemed unclear. But now, after our conversation, I can clearly see that I want to advocate for people who don't have access and help them develop their potential or connect them with the ones who can.
I wake up and there's an ocean outside my bedroom balcony. I have coffee, time to read a little bit, and don't feel rushed. I have the freedom to manage my schedule the way I want to, setting up my life and making it work versus adhering to a company timeline. My love is there with me and my kids are grown or close to it.
I have a hard time making changes in my life, whether it's leaving a job, moving to a new apartment, or ending relationships. I tend to stay in situations much longer than I should because I'm afraid of getting out of my comfort zone. When I do finally make a change, it's often a significant improvement, and I wonder why I didn't do it sooner.
I've noticed that my sense of loyalty extends not only to my job but also to relationships and even property. I think it's because I value commitment highly.
I'm afraid that if I take a leap of faith and change my life, I might fail or not enjoy it. I have a 7 out of 10 confidence level in making a good decision, and I feel that having all the facts and doing my due diligence would make it an 8.
I have been loyal with my past company for 15 years, and although I am still new in my current role, I feel the need to find the right place where I can commit as a therapist. I want to make sure it's a good fit because I value stability in my life.
I was laid off from my job, but I had the option to stay or take a package since I reached the 15-year mark. I decided it was a good time to do something else.
I feel like there are a lot of people out there that have a lot to offer, but because they don't have the exposure to certain people, and that may be just their look alone may not ever allow them to have the exposure, their dialect may not allow them to have the exposure, their documented status, you know, different things. So and then I… if you don't know what's out there and you don't know how to do it, you don't know the path to take and you don't have somebody to guide you. You know, you may never have these opportunities. And so I want to help people find that.
I feel really fortunate to have had such a great mentorship experience which helped me transition in my career. Now, I want to help others find similar resources and support.
I'm not sure how to move into the counseling role or therapy role, and I don't know what population I want to work with or what type of theory I want to do. During my practicum, I thought I only wanted to work with adults, but we saw families, children, and many different people, and I didn't find any population that I wasn't interested in working with.
So I came in with a narrow mind about how it might be play out, but then I left feeling like, oh, I can work with all of these people and I enjoy… enjoy it.
I think my need for loyalty and security comes from my childhood when we were homeless for a year. Now, I have built some stability for myself through my career, but there's always this fear in the back of my mind that things can be taken away.
I'm going through a transition in my life right now and my thoughts feel really jumbled. I just graduated and received my Masters last week. I want to get some direction about where I might take the next part of my life.
I have been in the banking industry for 20 years and now I am considering switching to counseling. Although my banking career is stable, I find myself scared to make the jump because I would be starting from scratch and I'm concerned about the financial implications of making such a change. Additionally, I just turned 40 and have mixed feelings about this new phase of my life.
I feel very excited about starting this new decade in my life, but I also feel like I'm at the beginning of it, unsure of how to move forward. I'm 40, and I want to feel accomplished instead of feeling like I'm starting over.
Lately, I have been feeling overwhelmed with the variety of resources and networking opportunities that are available to me. I've become closer with my program peers, and that support has been helpful. If I had a group of friends with me, I think I would have more courage and take more initiative in utilizing these resources.
I wanted to get a hiking group, like a therapist hiking group together and just do hikes once a quarter. I talked with people from my program and at my site, and everybody was like, yeah, I'd love to do that. Just to connect everybody and get some exercise. It's on my heart to do that, but I don't know what the holdup is.
I'm struggling to decide between three options related to my job situation: 1) Keep working full-time at my banking job and maintain my non-paid extra hours at the other site to accelerate my licensure process. 2) Quit banking, get a paid position, and accelerate my licensure process to become self-supporting quicker. 3) Continue banking part-time and stretch out my licensure process. I'm leaning towards either doing part-time employment while keeping my banking job or finding another option.
I am considering going back to my practicum site as it is close to my home and I can set my own hours. It would be a free and comfortable environment. However, I wonder if all the education I have received will be wasted if I work for free.
I've been helping people with resumes and interviews, and I feel my purpose is to help them unlock their potential. I want to find a way to blend this passion with my current banking job without hurting myself financially. But I'm also a parent, and I don't want to take too much time away from my daughter, so I'm struggling to figure out how to do all this. How can I manage these commitments and pursue my goal without sacrificing too much?
So I've thought about, you know, do I just let, you know… Originally, this was really before I got so far into it, but my initial thought was, oh, well, you know, get my Masters and then I'll leave banking and then I'll go into, you know, a therapy type role and get my hours. At this point after doing, you know, just some preliminary job searching, it doesn't look realistic for right now. So I'm thinking, well, okay, maybe I can keep the job, maybe get a part time job that's night and weekends, or I… I can go back to my practicum site, I wouldn't be paid, but I would have the flexibility to
I feel a bit hesitant to put my voice out there and ask questions online. I don't think I feel that strong about it at this point, but I'm willing to engage and try. On a scale of 1 to 5, I think I might be able to do it in two months' time, by the end of summer.
I would rate my reaching out as a 2.5, and attending events like luncheons as a 4.5. I thought of sending my final project to the therapist I interviewed and connect with her, rating that as a 5. Some of the work she's involved in aligns with my interests. There might be other events I could attend to make connections.
As a patient, I'd say I'm about a 5 on the scale of being willing to look and see what's out there.
I feel like I need to connect with someone who is doing what I want to do, but I don't know anyone like that yet. I think a Facebook group I'm in could be a good start to find such people.
I have recently graduated and need a month to settle. In the next two months, I plan on attending a networking luncheon if one is happening. If there's no luncheon scheduled, I'll apply for my associate number and try to connect with someone on Facebook.
I have seen some posts where people ask ideas about decorating their office. I feel like there are so many topics on there, and I can find my way into a conversation.
As a patient, I've been considering some potential opportunities in my field, like paid positions that allow for associate level involvement. I'm not sure, but I think this might be a good direction for me to explore.
I have just graduated and I want to become a therapist to help people. I believe this will give me a sense of purpose and allow me to use my experiences over the years to positively impact others' lives. I also see it as a way to make a living.
I think my main focus is helping people who have skills, abilities, or talents but don't recognize their own abilities or don't have the resources to harness them. I feel like I missed out on opportunities in my younger years because I didn't have the confidence to pursue them.
I really want to be an advocate and empower people and help them find resources for support. I've been fortunate to come across some great mentors through my job, who have guided me along this path.
I have all of these things that I want to do and, you know, in reality, what is the harm in just going out there and looking at jobs and talking to people and really considering it, but I stopped myself. The harm is I think that it's just this feeling that maybe I might be attracted to some job or opportunity, and maybe I make a bad decision. Does that make sense?
I feel like I think everything through and have been comfortable with my life, but now I am in a bit of a rut. I'm not sure what my options are and I need to take some initiative. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being little faith in myself and 10 being a great decision maker, I'd say I'm about a 7.
I'm considering making a significant change in my life, but I'm worried about giving up something that I already enjoy. I've been doing research and weighing my options, but there's still a part of me that feels like it's out of my control.
I enjoy having a welcoming home that offers an amazing view for my guests. I am my own boss and have control over my schedule, which makes me feel time affluent. I'm very confident that I can maintain this lifestyle.
I've been working towards switching careers from banking to therapy, but I'm afraid of making a mistake and losing everything. I've talked to a few therapists and looked at job postings, but I haven't yet talked to anyone who's made a similar career shift. I'm worried about letting go of the familiar and comfortable.
I feel a lot of fear when I start to look into other jobs, and I think it holds me back a little bit.
I am considering a role in Human Resources and eventually want to have my own practice. But three years for my license doesn't seem realistic. If everything was exactly the way I wanted it to be, I would wake up in the morning and open my blinds to the ocean.
I want to have my own part-time practice near the ocean, possibly sharing a beautiful space with some friends from my cohort. I also envision participating in other therapy-related work, such as traveling and conducting group sessions. Additionally, I want my children to be happy and at peace in their lives, and I care about their wellbeing.
As a patient, I have managed to find a balance between my clients, collaborating with my partners, and doing additional things like consulting or groups. Currently, I see the in-house HR position as a stepping stone and not the dream. It's a way for me to combine the skills I've learned in school with the career I already have.
I recently moved into a new apartment and realized I had been settling for less than I deserved in my previous living situation. This experience made me think about my current job and how it might also be holding me back. I have been researching and planning my next career move, but I still have a lot of fear and anxiety about actually making the change and taking risks. I've joined a Facebook group with therapists, but haven't made much progress in my job search.
I failed in a situation and would like to have done that better. I am interested in discussing resources that can help me for future instances.
I recently had my first negative experience at school with a confrontation, and I'm hoping that by replaying the situation in my mind, I can gain confidence and learn to defend myself intelligently in the future. I want to make sure I'm not caught off-guard again.
I feel like I need things to be interesting and exciting in my life, but also well-planned so that nothing catches me off-guard. I think a completely predictable life would be boring, but I'm worried about finding the right balance between excitement and stability.
I am still struggling with the traumatic experience I had with a teacher that shook me to my core. Although it's affecting my performance at school, I can't help but feel anxious about the situation.
I recently had a situation where my palms got sweaty, and I had to walk up and get out of the car. I tried to detach from the situation after it was over, as I feel I addressed it better the second time. I believe if it happens with the same teacher again, it wouldn't happen in the same way. This is where the scene happened.
I don't think I've learned anything really new about myself, but it sort of reinforced the fact that I don't quit. I initiated a second meeting with a teacher who had previously shaken me to the core.
I was the first one to formally confront this teacher, and it added to my anxiety about the second meeting. However, I realized later that I wasn't the only person on her list.
I recently had a difficult experience with someone that left me feeling really shaky. I spent four days going over the situation in my mind, almost studying it, before I went back to talk to them again. Surprisingly, the second conversation went well.
I do not sit with a straight back and when I was in that meeting, I was still hesitant and shy expressing my feelings to her, emotionally and professionally about how the situation affected me. Talking to this person brought back the same sensations, but I had a sense of pride when I left.
I recently faced a situation that didn't go perfectly, but I managed to handle it the way I wanted to. It was a bit sloppy but it got done and I feel a sense of pride.
I'm still processing a situation that took place at the school where I work. I go to the school every day, and I can honestly say I don't drive into the school grounds without thinking, this is where it happened.
I experienced something that felt almost like a trauma, and I still think about it. But at the same time, I praise myself for overcoming it.
As I grew up, I learned that there's an override to always being polite. I realized that in some situations the old saying doesn't apply and I have to trust my instincts instead.
I often find myself thinking about my conversations with everyone, whether they went the way I intended or not. When I'm driving or in my spare time, I reflect on these conversations and try to reconstruct them to see how they could've gone better. I hope to use this reflection to improve future interactions.
I find the process of reconstructions and replays helpful, but sometimes I don't like the length of time it takes, especially when it doesn't go the way I want. Sometimes it bothers me and I spend time dwelling on it, but at other times, I find it a constructive tool.
I have been using self-reflection to better myself, but I can't remember when I started doing it. I replay conversations in my head, and while it may not always help me in future conversations, it makes me feel better about the one that just passed.
Sometimes, when I'm in certain situations, I get so stressed out that I lose my words and am not quite myself.
I think I would be more myself in that situation, becoming more aggressive, forthright, and confident behind my words.
As I'm sitting here, I'm imagining myself in a state of being more assertive. In that situation, my back would be straight, and my posture would be way up.
Lately, I feel like I'm struggling with being forthright in expressing my thoughts and opinions. I want to be able to speak with confidence and power, but it's difficult for me to do so.
Lately, I've been struggling with my confidence in what I'm saying. I want to truly believe in what I am saying and have an inner knowledge that I'm right.
I found the interview really interesting. I was surprised that we didn't go right into the conflict. I really enjoyed starting on a positive note and hearing an example of where I didn't have the problem that had happened the week before. It's nice to go into a sense of pride and then take that sense of pride into the problem area.
I was ready to go right into the meat and bones of the problem, but we started talking about something pleasant, which I actually enjoyed.
I recently had a session where we talked about my strengths first and then used those strengths to discuss a problem I was facing. I found it helpful to keep my resources in mind while tackling the issue. Moreover, I appreciated not going into the step-by-step details of the situation, as doing so might have caused me anxiety.
Lately, I've been struggling with some personal issues. I know that you don't need to know all of the details to help me, but I'm reaching out for guidance on possible solutions.
I was yelling and unable to control my emotions. However, an inner mechanism helped me calm down and get control of my senses before starting fresh. I think we have covered a lot.
I think I'll use them again in my professional work ethic, the not quitting and believing in yourself and staying with it. I definitely take from this and I apply it everyday. And as we have talked about earlier that there are moments when I do not have this problem in a confrontation situation, and there are exceptions that I'm acknowledging as healthy.
I recently experienced a situation that shook me to my core. However, what surprises me is how fast I recovered from it. I feel like this experience has made me realize who I am, and at a very basic level, that part of me can't be violated. Now, I'm able to speak up and stand up for myself in different situations.
I found it helpful to stand up for myself and others in a difficult situation at school. It made me feel like I was a part of a problem that was greater than myself and added a different degree of responsibility.
I feel very comfortable talking with you right now. If we were successful in helping me even within about 40 minutes we have today, and I were to wake up tomorrow morning and this miracle has happened, - and at the same time, because it's a miracle and I'm asleep, I really didn't know that it happened.
I feel like I lack the courage to stand up and confront situations. If I were on the right track, I think I would be able to artfully phrase what I want to say in confrontation situations and stand up for myself.
Lately, I've been feeling highly stressed and under a lot of pressure. I'm finding it difficult to deal with, but somehow, I want to rise up and be able to return to my normal self in these situations and find a way to get the stress out.
As a patient, my understanding of brief counseling is very goal-oriented, and I can't bring goals into a discussion without bringing feelings in there as well. I feel like feelings go hand in hand with the goals. We didn't specifically say what our goals for the future are, but they were implied and drawn out without having to use the actual words.
As the patient, I feel like the essence of creating goals in our previous conversation was there, even though we didn't use the actual word 'goal'.
I had a learning experience, and I sought out not just myself in terms of replaying that but also talked with other people. I definitely like the support of others, and if I was wrong, people I asked would have said so, and then I would have gone to you and said, 'I apologize.' It's just important for me to get feedback from different perspectives.
I've been trying to change my perspective on certain situations and seeking input from others to help me make better decisions in the future.
I think what we haven't talked about might be my physical reaction during that first incident and how that might be controlled in the future. The physical came from the anxiety, the instant anxiety, and the stress that came from being taken off-guard but being taken off-guard in a very confrontational authoritative way.
I don't know if relaxation techniques would have helped in that situation. I certainly wasn't going to close my eyes and take a deep breath and count to ten when she was there.
Recently, I had a situation in a professional context where I struggled, and there have also been some social situations with friends where some incidents happened. They would catch me when I come home or on the phone, and I feel like I need help with handling these situations.
Recently, someone confronted me with an accusation or challenge that I wasn't prepared for, and it caught me off-guard. I'm wondering if there's a way to improve my skills so that I'm better equipped to handle such situations.
I work as a guidance counselor in a high school, and I interact with teachers, other faculty members, and parents on a daily basis. There are many situations where I don't know everything, and I feel that certain techniques could be very useful for me.
I had an incident with a former landlord of mine, where he approached me where I live and made some accusations about the condition of the house that we had lived in.
I struggle when I'm suddenly confronted with situations where I don't have time to assess what's going on. An example is the incident last week when I was taken off-guard. If I had time to prepare, I might have been able to handle it better.
During a recent uncomfortable situation, I found myself retreating within myself. I started out standing straight with my hands in front of me, but as the situation progressed, I ended up leaning against a wall with my hands behind my back. It felt like I was seeking support and would have continued to walk backwards if the wall wasn't there.
Lately, I've been feeling scared in certain situations, and I think it's a control issue. However, this doesn't happen very often. Sometimes there can be weeks or even months when I feel on top of my game and nothing bothers me.
I'm feeling conflicted because, on one hand, I wish I had handled the situation better, so there wouldn't have been a need for a second meeting. On the other hand, if I had done that, she would have gotten away with it and it wouldn't have been brought up. I think she might have done this to someone else who may have let it go. Now, I'm anxious about the possibility of a third meeting.
I think, the third meeting would be very similar to the second one. Maybe with a little less nervousness and anxiety having repeated this several times. In the second meeting, I talked about a message from childhood of respect for people who are older or adults. I was able to show respect and also stand up for myself in that meeting. It was different because she had calmed down a little bit and we were treating each other with more mutual respect.
I had a challenging situation with my teacher which made me feel degraded. However, I managed to convey my respect for her, both as a teacher and an elder, during our second meeting. I had to overcome some obstacles related to the age difference and my qualifications, but now I feel more confident about handling similar situations in the future.
I recently had a challenging experience, but I think it was a good learning experience overall.
Lately, I've been thinking about a specific event and the subsequent ones that followed our second meeting. I tried to analyze it from a systemic perspective, viewing it as another chapter in my life. Over the weekend, I focused on the role-playing aspect, thinking about how I could've handled the situation differently and how I'll approach the second meeting.
I feel like I didn't bring out the positive in others and focused only on encouraging myself. I didn't even think about my landlord when going through it. However, I did stand up for myself, which felt good.
Recently, about half a dozen other teachers came up to me and mentioned a incident I was involved in. They praised me for handling it well and said it was something nobody had done before. Even my supervisor praised me many times for my actions.
I was finally able to express my thoughts to someone I had a conflict with. I told her how I wished the situation resolved itself and how I want it to be resolved in the future. After that, I left. Do you think I handled the situation well?
I wanted to make sure that the situation I experienced didn't happen again, even though it might. I knew I had to start somewhere, so I made inquiries about the school's policies and tried to address her behavior, hoping that my actions could help prevent it from happening again.
I got knocked off in a traumatic way initially, but four days later, I came back and handled it. Although it was a bit sloppy, I came out having some pride in myself and I feel that there are positives and negatives to every situation.
Lately, I've been feeling that there are no negative learning situations and that anything I learn from is ultimately a positive thing.
Today, I stood up and suddenly felt my hands sweating and my legs shaking. It had a significant impact during the afternoon, and I'm not sure where that feeling came from.
I'd like to share that there's an image of anger that comes up when I think of a certain person. I feel angry when I see them, and I don't know if that was the source of the energy that drove me to stand up the way I did. There's definitely a feeling of being wronged and wanting to do right this time. I could have called on that, thinking about it, as it might have been the last time I was going to see them.
I struggle with standing up for myself and confronting someone older than me, especially when I feel like it's my last chance to do so. Growing up, I was taught not to talk back to adults, which makes it difficult for me to seize the moment and assert myself.
As an adult in a professional setting, I sometimes feel like I'm not qualified enough to talk to some people, and I think it's because I was always told to be polite growing up.
I really didn't like it, you know, I really didn't like it. It bothered me that I didn't like it and the reasons behind my not liking of what I was doing and did not like.
I definitely feel I have made that resolved. I worked hard to separate myself and say, 'Okay, this has passed.' I've had meetings with different people in the school and I've confronted that teacher again. I just don't know if I can leave it until the next meeting. I wish it had been at the time.
I had an incident at school that went wrong, and it happened with only five minutes left in the school day. There was no feedback from my colleagues, and I left the school feeling shaken.
I got in my car at school the other day, and I felt very disgraced and embarrassed. I was shaking, but at the same time, I felt proud of how I handled the situation.
I recently had a confrontation with a teacher, and the first time, I felt really shaken. But during the second confrontation, which was in a formal setting with the principal as a mediator, I still felt shaken, but I was more confident and felt more together with myself.
I sometimes feel caught off-guard in certain situations, and instead of handling it well, I retreat within myself and hide, almost like a coward. I enjoy being taken off-guard, but I would really like to improve my ability to compose myself and rise to the occasion when it happens.
For the past few days, I've been feeling really bothered by a certain situation that happened at work. It was the first time I faced such an issue in a professional setting. I keep thinking about how I wish I had said or done things differently, and it's been occupying my mind even during the weekend.
I'm trying to set a professional standard, but I had a disagreement with a teacher that I truly believe I was right about. However, I didn't say anything and just accepted what the teacher was saying to me loudly. I found the teacher very irrational and it left me feeling confused. I've tried to visualize the situation.
I was trying to recall and describe what the hallway looked like and what I might have observed if I were a fly on the wall during that ten-minute period. To be honest, I really didn't like it.
Recently, my roommate accused me of some things and we ended up having a confrontation about breaking our lease. I was confident in my argument and stood my ground, and I felt proud of myself afterward. However, during the confrontation, I was shaking and my hands and voice were trembling.
I had a little altercation with someone, and those who witnessed it told me that they hadn't seen that side of me in a long time. I'm not sure how I managed to stand up to him like that.
So this time, I knew it might happen but I wasn't quite ready for it to happen. When I had seen him pull up, I said, 'Here, here it goes,' and he just popped in the door. I don't know exactly what it was, but something, I sort of think of it as a reserve energy.
I've been feeling completely depleted lately, but somehow, I've been able to pull from this backup energy source. I experienced a whole range of emotions, and even though I came out shaky, I felt proud that I stood up and did what needed to be done.
I didn't let her get away with it, even though I was new to the social situation. I think it took some courage for me to stand up.
Sometimes I don't praise myself, but I've not given much thought to it. Over the weekend, I thought about a recent event and I didn't think about having to see the person involved again on Tuesday. On Monday, when I saw the appointment in my book, I got a rush and realized I'm going to have to face this situation again.
I've been constantly telling myself that I can do this and that I'm on the right track. I've learned from my mistakes and I've taken appropriate measures to improve. I went in and said my piece.
I had a conversation with someone recently, and she argued with me, but it wasn't like the previous week. The tone was more civilized this time, and she disagreed with how I handled the situation. I also expressed my thoughts on the matter.
I'm angry about my sister making a farce out of returning and my brother-in-law treating her badly. Last week, I felt so much love for her, but now I feel disappointed she's not in the household anymore. I still care for her, but I'm just so angry. What kind of a moron does something like that?
I don't love interacting with people who I consider to be foolish or less intelligent. Because of this, I prefer to stay inside and avoid socializing with others. I feel disappointed about this aspect of myself and this has been an ongoing issue for me.
I don't even know what I am now. I'm just me, and this is the way I was born, you know. I don't like people very much, and they never fail to fulfill my expectations of their jerkiness. I want to go. I'm done. I want to go right now.
Recently, I have realized that there's a darker side to me that is always present. I am not interested in anyone, including myself, and I am unable to see any potential improvement right now.
I'm really not sure just who I am, I mean when it comes right down to it you ask me who that is that's above the dork, or hipster, or whatever you wanna call it, but I don't know who that is, I don't know who I am, what's the over-riding I?
Lately, I've been struggling to figure out who my real self is and it's causing me to feel constantly conflicted in different situations. For example, I've been experiencing interpersonal conflicts and arguments even over simple things like at the supermarket, and it seems like it's become my way of life.
As a patient, I'm struggling with an internal conflict between two aspects of myself, the dork and the hip person. I feel like there's a voice inside me saying 'You're not good enough'. I'm not sure how to relate to the world outside and resolve conflicts with other people.
I don't know what they'd say but I know they wouldn't like each other.
I've always thought of myself as a dork, and I tend to ignore this side of myself because I find it unattractive and useless. However, I am starting to realize that maybe ignoring this part of me could be limiting my vitality and versatility.
I feel like I have this gap between my dork side and my hip side, and I'm not sure how to bring them together. I don't want to be a dork because I'm scared of people and feel insecure about myself.
I'm having trouble with the dork and hipster sides of myself, and I don't want that dork in me. I'm wondering how the dork could take what the hipster offers and what the hipster could contribute to the dork.
I'm not comfortable with this hip thing. I don't think I'm a hip guy and I have trouble tolerating the excitement of the idea. Positive thoughts about myself and the idea of my inner complexity do not sit easily within my mind.
I'm disappointed that I couldn't help my sister. It doesn't hurt me, though, because it's not my problem. We lived together for eight days, but it was just like staying with her when we were 17.
I don't like the romantic side of myself, and I don't expect great things for my sister as it seems like an idealized fantasy. I feel like I'm in a bad way.
I have a sense that most things are vaguely boring, at least vaguely boring and mundane. There are real problems and I see that there are problems, but it seems like I have forgotten how to want something.
I don't do anything exceptional. I write lame ad copy for local stuff, and the expectations are not high. It's all in the Southern California area, so it's not a big deal. This session is actually boring me.
I attended a session with my counsellor, and while they found our first session illuminating and exciting, I didn't share the same feeling. They tried to resonate with me using provocative language, thinking it would help engage me since I have an irreverent and rebellious attitude, but it didn't make the session exciting for me.
I have a habit of keeping people, including my counsellor, at a distance. I don't think I want to keep them out, but it's just something I do.
I had told her what I was gonna be wearing and described myself. However, I didn't mention that I would be dishevelled. I was extremely self-conscious.
I have been noticing and worrying about where my hands should be, like if they should be here, there, or in another specific position.
I was concentrating on myself during the conversation, and I had this internal dialogue where I kept telling myself to say something intelligent. But then I would just respond back to myself, saying that I had nothing to say. It was incredibly distracting.
I was trying to have a conversation with someone, but I didn't want to make banal chatter. I tried to say something witty, but we ended up talking about computers – which is a topic that I am familiar with. It was a dull conversation, and I'm feeling disappointed with myself for not making it more interesting.
I recently had a conversation with someone, and it seemed a little tense at first. We both seemed to loosen up a bit by the end of the conversation. I tried asking her out on Friday, but she said she was busy. I took that as a 'no', and I'm not sure how to interpret her response.
I think Gerald knows himself pretty well, but he misunderstands his possibilities or has given up on his needs and desires. I haven't left my house for 90 days, and I'm not pleased with it, but I'm uncomfortable around people. I have everything I need and have a social life.
I have an electronic social life and a girlfriend in Toronto, but the thing is, I don't really know what she is, and she doesn't know what I am. I don't even know if it's a woman, and that's the weird thing about having a social life that's electronic.
I am six foot two, and I'm confused about the satisfaction we get from our social life. I'm out of the house right now but I wonder, what's the big deal with it?
I feel like when I say something, it doesn't matter much to the other person. They easily ride over my words, and it seems like they have their mind made up. I tried to express my thoughts, but they didn't let me finish.
I've never really tried to be kind, but in a big emergency, I'm able to put aside my misanthropy and help out.
When I was in high school, I had to work during the summer to help my mother's struggling business, while my friends enjoyed their vacation at Martha's Vineyard. It was an emergency situation and I did it out of kindness for someone close to me.
I've been struggling with focusing on the present moment. I tend to skip ahead in conversations, but this time I caught myself and shared it instead of keeping it to myself.
I've been skipping ahead in life and recently realized that it would be nice to deal with people on another level. It's a new thought, and I wonder who could put up with me for three hours.
I've been in therapy before and I'm not really convinced about the idea of insight leading to change. My sister, a therapist, convinced me to come here, but I'm not fully on board with this process. I'm not an idiot and I don't have a lot of faith in therapy.
I think a lot of people are really stupid and boring, and I know I'm not an idiot, but I don't do well with my social interactions. My office went virtual, and I do everything by computer. My wife doesn't see that there's no difference since there are no physical office get-togethers anymore.
Recently, I had a fun date which went as expected but still left me feeling angry and overall bad.
I was recently told by someone that I appeared disheveled and even though they mentioned other things as well, I can't seem to get past that term. I'm unsure if I really looked disheveled, but the fact that they thought so bothers me.
I recently had an interaction with someone who was very bright, and it went really badly. I wasn't smooth at all, and it was exactly what I had predicted.
I went on a date with someone I liked, but I didn't have funny things to say or intelligent banter to engage her with. At the end of the date, I asked her if she wanted to go out again, but she declined. Surprisingly, I'm not as miserable about it as I thought I'd be.
I don't want to hurt other people for no reason. Is that a positive thing or just a personality default?
I feel like there are two sides of me. One side has moments when I could hurt someone for no reason, but I choose not to. I often think about whether it's kind not to run over a puppy in the road.
I want to bring my good side into the light of day, but I can't see the kind side of me, and I feel dominated and defeated.
I feel like there's something wrong but I can't quite put my finger on it. You make it seem like it's something that we can talk about, but I don't see it. I can't say I've never been kind but I'm just not sure what the issue is.
I got in trouble when I was eleven years old. The principal called me in and threatened me and said that he would suspend me next time. It's not real trouble, I mean they don't do anything to eleven year olds. Also, I was treated very badly by two therapists, but it doesn't really matter.
I'm feeling upset because my friend told my principal that I was smoking when I was eleven. I think it was terrible of him to do that. Also, I want to mention that I consider myself a very analytical person and I believe that I have insight into myself.
I felt mildly offended when the counsellor made a confrontation because they didn't want me to set the boundaries of what I can and can't learn from our sessions together. I felt amused by their comment that they got through to me.
I feel like I always have to do everything by myself, and I'm struggling with the isolation that it brings. I end up interrupting others because I'm always in my own world.
I feel like this is therapy, and I should be telling you about myself, but I'm unsure what to talk about.
I had bad therapists before and they broke confidentiality when I talked to Suzanne about my issues. I feel like my reflexes were established a long time ago and have nothing to do with what's going on now.
I recently had a bad experience when someone told my principal about something I said in therapy.
I took her attitude as a no. I took her no as a no. It was a clear no. Her attitude was no, not ever.
As the patient, I recently had a conversation with my counsellor where I expressed my perspective on a situation. I admitted that I understand why my counsellor can't trust my judgments because of the way I make them. I suggested that my counsellor should call someone else to get a clearer understanding.
I've been told that my humor is sharp and quick, and my language is metaphorical and colorful. I've accepted this recognition of my positive qualities for the first time. However, I don't know what to do about it and I worry that insight doesn't lead to change.
I don't take compliments well. I don't like compliments. I don't like to be complimented. Why do you think that is?
I've been trying to get out of the house every day because I think it's good for me. When I go outside, the air feels nice and it feels good to be out of the house.
I feel like I've gotten something out of this therapy and I like that you don't take any nonsense from me. However, I've been thinking about stopping this therapy since I have a social life now. What do you think about it?
I'm not sure if we should continue our therapy sessions or not, and if we do, what would be the best way to do it? Should we decrease the frequency of our meetings?
I think it would be a good idea to see each other once a month for a few months to gradually stop our sessions. We can then evaluate how things go and decide what's best for me.
I never used to be visibly uncomfortable, but this time I couldn't muster the 'Yes Bob, that's a good idea' and I was having troubles with it. I feel like I'm unable to go out and interact with humans.
I feel like I'm becoming unable to do something that I used to do, and it's really disturbing and immobilizing.
I shared my thoughts with Bob about the campaign being wrong on a couple of accounts, and I didn't like the slogan. I suggested that if we came up with a better idea, the giveaway would be moot, and people would be interested in the product already. However, Bob's reaction was simply 'This is my idea'.
I recently overheard my coworker talking to my boss and saying, 'I think it's a damn good idea.' I don't know the exact details of their conversation, but I feel anxious and unsure about what they were discussing. It makes me feel like I'm always several steps behind, and maybe I should be moving faster.
I'm not happy with this session. I feel like I've been caught in a lie and I've never thought I was unable to be caught. I can see some sense in what you're saying, but I don't like this situation.
I went to a party this week, and it was kind of an interesting experience. I'm thinking of becoming a party boy.
I attended a party and started talking to a girl in my usual corner, but I felt like I wasn't doing that well. I realized I was giving her contradictory cues and I generally feel like an outsider. I understand what it's like to be thought of as a dork.
I don't want to confront my boss because I'm afraid of losing my job. I think it's an act of self-defense, and I see it as a practical decision. What should I do?
I feel defeated and feel like the whole world is my boss. I feel like I have to stay away from everybody, and I don't have a sense of differentiation as to who I could be, what I need to be with, and who I can't. I hold so many people in such a high degree of disdain.
Several weeks ago, my sister came to stay with me during a marital crisis. She recently went back to her husband, and I just think she's an idiot.
Well, I'm not trying to be delineated per se. It's just that she's in a bad situation and she's going back to this guy. I think she just needs the routine.
I imagine if I were to confront him about the issue, he would tell me to clear out my desk and go to the other side of the living room. But since it's my apartment, he can't really make me leave the office.
As a patient, I have trouble with expressing humor and making jokes. I sometimes hold up my hand to let others know when it's a joke.
I feel like if I say what's really on my mind, especially to my boss, I'd be in big trouble and possibly lose my job. I don't think I need to tell people what I think about them, even if it's not my boss.
I have a tendency to withdraw from certain situations or not say certain things to people because I don't want to hurt their feelings. It could be seen as an act of kindness, but at the same time, I feel like there's no conflict or energy within me.
As the patient, I find these exercises to be silly. What exactly are we trying to accomplish with them?
I don't want to win or compete, I just want to understand what's going on in this situation. However, I'm feeling extremely uncomfortable right now, and I think this session is not going well.
I know something but I usually say I don't know to avoid confrontation. I feel like I'm lying when I say that. I don't know why I do it, but I think we all lie at some point in our lives. So, yes, I have lied before.
I've been having trouble with my partner, Suzanne. She always wants to go out and get me out of the house, but I tell her that I'm unable to. However, deep down, I know that it's a lie.
I've been struggling with feeling like I'm not being honest with myself or others, and I finally admitted that I've been lying.
I know I'm not big in, like, "affect(ph) boy", I know I'm- not really outgoing but I just, you know I.
I've lived with myself for so long and I don't find myself interesting anymore.
I must say I prefer a therapist who calls me a know-it-all and gives me some feedback. The other therapeutic experience that I had was, he just didn't say anything. I know I'm a know-it-all, I mean I know it. That I know too.
I haven't quite committed to this whole therapy thing, but I have some questions. Maybe it's too early in this meeting to ask.
I've been the way that I am for a very long time, and I don't think I can change just because of an insightful statement. What are you going to do with me?
I'm having trouble imagining how a dork would defend himself against being made fun of by a hipster. The hipster is witty and confidently says 'What a geek!' to the dork, but I don't know what the dork would say in response, as he is too dorky and afraid of the hipster.
I'm playing the role of a dork in a conversation with a hipster. The hipster tells me to get away, and I respond with 'Please don't hurt me.' What's it like for me as the dork to say that?
I don't want to be the dork, and I don't even want to play the dork. I feel conflicted within, not just with you or the world at large.
I feel some conflict within myself, and it's not making me happy. I want to have happiness, but I don't have it right now.
I am feeling much better these days, as I haven't been this active in a long time. I have been taking walks every day since last week, and it's really helping me.
I'm 32 years old and I want to settle down. But every time a relationship ends, it gets harder for me as I wonder if I'll ever have a family, a dog, and a perfect life. I feel overwhelmed knowing that I have to start over again.
I have this pattern in all my relationships where I jump in too quickly, feel excited, and then end up being hurt when they end. It's scary talking about this because things move too fast and end even faster. For example, four years ago, I was in a relationship for only two to three weeks, and we decided to go to Hawaii together.
I recently ended my relationship with my girlfriend, who was also my best friend for a year and a half. I felt alone and confused as she didn't want to spend as much time together and didn't share her problems with me like she used to when we were just friends. This has left me feeling hurt and upset.
I miss my best friend a lot and I'm in a hard spot right now. Part of me wants to call her and see if we can work things out, while another part of me wants to just let it go and move on. We haven't talked for the last two weeks, and it feels weird not hearing from her since we used to talk about everything.
As a patient, I struggle with getting too excited and immersed in a relationship, which causes me to overlook certain aspects or red flags that I should have been aware of.
I ignored some red flags in my past relationship due to my eagerness to be in one. I was with someone who smoked weed frequently and had issues with her baby daddy. I didn't have a close relationship with my father growing up, and I think that's why I'm so eager to build my own family and fill that emptiness inside.
I'm constantly jumping from one relationship to another, almost as if I'm afraid to be alone. I tend to ignore red flags and get too eager to enter new relationships. It feels like I'm trying to fill a void inside me, and being in a relationship temporarily takes away the pain of feeling alone. It's been a long time since I've been single.
Recently, I've been working on my mental health, and I'm glad to say that I feel like I'm improving. I'm not perfect, but I just wanted to share that I feel better.
I feel like I need to be better at punctuality, but I also question why I have to be at work before my boss. I don't want my performance to be affected or have someone point it out to me, as it would really upset me. I keep telling myself to improve, but I still struggle with this issue.
I always struggle with the debate between getting an extra 10 minutes of sleep and motivating myself to get up. It's exhausting and hard to overcome. When I talk about it, I realize how much it bothers me because I tend to not focus on it as an issue when I'm having this internal debate.
I wanted to change something about myself and become more serious about it.
I've been struggling to wake up early for work. I'm hoping that eventually, I'll get so annoyed with myself that I'll have no choice but to get out of bed at the right time. Right now, when my alarm goes off at 5:45 am, I tend to snooze it for an extra few minutes because I feel tired. But that doesn't really help, and I just feel more frustrated with myself.
I often find myself feeling irresponsible for being late, while at the same time thinking it's not a big deal since others are late too. However, I don't want to be perceived as an irresponsible person, and this debate constantly goes on in my head.
As a patient, I often struggle with tardiness due to sleeping too long and traffic. This causes me to be late to events, like family functions, where I feel like all eyes are on me. My family is usually very punctual and I think I make more of an issue out of it than it actually is.
I get really bothered when people depend on me to be at a certain place at a specific time, like at work or family events, and I'm even slightly late. I think it's probably more of an issue for me than it is for other people.
I don't like to be known as the person that is always late. In the past, I overslept for a work function when I was a lead server at a restaurant. It was a reward for all the lead servers to go to Catalina Island, and I had to be in Long Beach where the boat docked in the morning. My goal was to be up and out of the house by 6:30, but I woke up at 7:00.
I have been struggling with tardiness for a few years now. Despite trying to stay away from it, it always comes back. Tardiness to me means being late to any type of activity, event, work, school, or anything where I am required to be somewhere at a certain time. Even being two or three minutes late causes me stress.
I feel like I am always running up against the clock and showing up five minutes late, ten minutes late even though I am not significantly late. I don't like being even five minutes late after I am supposed to be. Most of the time, I end up being late and it's important for work.
I'm always worried about being late to work, but I often end up being five minutes late because others are late too. As long as I get there before my boss, it goes unnoticed. What stresses me out the most is that I'm late due to oversleeping, not getting up in time, and dealing with traffic. There are many factors contributing to my lateness.
I've noticed that my family is unhappy with me for my habit of being late, but it hasn't really affected my life much. I'm usually only late by five or ten minutes, and it hasn't caused any major problems or disruptions in my life. I even managed to barely make it on time for a boat trip recently.
I have stopped my tardiness from getting worse. Although I haven't fully corrected it, I make efforts to not be extremely late, like an hour or two. I try to wake up earlier or tell myself to be at my destination thirty minutes earlier than required.
I have a habit of setting all my clocks ahead by different amounts of time to trick myself into being on time. I know how far ahead each clock is, but I haven't found any other methods to prevent myself from being late.
I've always struggled with punctuality, and I remember one incident where I barely made it to a boat event. I've also faced issues at work where my supervisor told me to be at my desk and ready to work at the starting time instead of just entering the office at that time.
I have a habit of being late and it hasn't been a big issue in my current job, but I can see it being a problem in the future if I have a punctual boss. Right now, my boss isn't strictly punctual, and as long as I can get in before my colleagues, things seem fine.
I'm having trouble being punctual, especially at jobs where it's expected for me to be ready to work at 8 a.m. every day. I worry that if I can't do this or if I struggle, it will cause issues at work, particularly in situations where punctuality has more serious consequences.
I haven't been getting to work on time lately, and it's been over a month since I've been there right at 7 a.m. The last time I managed to get there on time, I set my alarm for 5:30 a.m., but usually, I keep snoozing it until 6:00 a.m. When I am on time, I won't snooze as many times and will be up at 5:40 or 5:45 a.m.
I've been struggling with tardiness and have been trying to counter it by using the snooze button less. Instead of snoozing it three times like I usually do, I know I have to get up after the second snooze. However, there was an instance where I still ended up being late for work because I had to wash my hair and took longer to get ready.
I am very annoyed with myself for constantly being tardy despite putting in efforts to wake up on time. I have tried setting my clocks ahead and telling myself I have to be somewhere earlier than I actually do. These strategies work sometimes, but not always.
I've noticed that my habit of being late goes in spurts, and it has become more difficult for me since I started attending evening classes. I usually finish school around 10 or 10:30 at night and try to go to bed as soon as possible, but I still have a hard time waking up on time for work at 7 a.m. in the morning.
Lately, I have been struggling to get to work on time, particularly when I have evening classes. I noticed that in the past couple of months, I have been five minutes late to work more often than when I was in school and got enough sleep. I tend to have spurts of punctuality and then being constantly late.
Lately, I've been having spurts where life happens, and it leaves me with less opportunities for sleep, causing me to be late more often. Currently, I'm in one of those late spurts.
I have been about five to ten minutes late everyday for the past month or so.
I liked the way you led me through the whole day from the time I get up until the time I go to sleep because it allowed me to visualize how it would be for me if my work was a part of my life but just one part of my life. And that felt very natural to me. And then, rewarding because, over the course of the day, I was able to make people feel very comfortable. And they trusted me. And that felt good. Uhm, and I said fun just because it was something that I liked.
I had a very positive experience while doing an exercise recently, and if I could find a way to replicate what I saw, it would be so positive for me.
I woke up in my house, and when I opened my eyes, I was looking right out onto the ocean. My wall was a window, just one big window, and it was right on the beach. I woke up without an alarm clock, only by the light of the sun, and it felt natural to me. I woke up around 7:30.
Today, I woke up next to my loving husband, and we had a nutritious breakfast together. I left the house about an hour and a half later.
I grew up under the eye of my very practical and pragmatic father, who doesn't like to spend a lot of money and is always making sure that everything has a time and a place. As a result, I feel like I can't pursue some of my hobbies and instead tend to be drawn towards conservative, professional, and safe jobs.
I feel like I have to choose a career for financial stability and taking care of my family, which affects my professional choices. My father's priorities have influenced me. I have always enjoyed theater, extracurricular activities, and hobbies like drama, but I don't think they are practical career options.
I used to play a musical instrument when I was a kid, but I stopped. I love how it makes me feel creative and expressive, and I feel so free when I'm singing or dancing. However, I don't know how to incorporate this kind of fun into my professional life.
I appreciate being able to spend time with my loved ones and focus on my day. I also recently went to a ballroom dance class with my husband, as we're learning how to dance together so we can go out and do it right.
Today, I enjoyed my day, not just at work, but also having some time to enjoy other things I'm working on with my partner. However, I am curious about discussing my professional goals.
When I was young, I wanted to be a diplomat, like an ambassador, because of my international experience. I also considered being a lawyer, doctor, and social worker. Most recently, I have been thinking about becoming a midwife.
I've noticed that at my current job, there seems to be a difference between people of color and white people in terms of their roles and traditional jobs. We had discussed this earlier, and I can't help but feel that there is some sort of a divide in our workplace.
I had an experience in the past that created a thirst in me to want to experience other cultures, traditions, and environments. I believe that's where my current interests stem from.
I've been reflecting on my past and present experiences, and I'm trying to understand how my interests, values, talents, and goals overlap with my life so far. My counsellor suggested a guided discovery or visualization exercise to help me in this process. I'm open to it and think it might be beneficial.
I was visualizing certain things, and I'm trying to find a balance between my life and work. The natural part of it is about creating a balanced life.
When I was growing up, even through college, I think that the things that made me happiest were always the more artistic courses. I did a lot of theater when I was in school, in elementary school all the way up through college. I was always very interested in the arts, and I thrived in that even though I did well academically as well. I always really felt comfortable and it was light being in the arts, whether it was a class or whether it was an extracurricular activity or even something outside of school, I always enjoyed that.
In the past, I didn't like science-related subjects and even managed to avoid taking them in college. But after college, I decided to pursue a career in the healthcare field, which required me to take science classes. So, I enrolled in a post-baccalaureate program.
I was initially not good at science and math, but after attending post-baccalaureate pre-med programs focusing on science, I started to enjoy it. In college, I attended Spelman College in Atlanta and double-majored in French Literature and Philosophy. I chose a double major because I felt that majoring in just French, which I learned in a bilingual school setting, wouldn't be enough to feel like I was earning my education.
Last session, my counsellor asked me to think about my scores on the C combination and explore other interests. She also wanted me to research five occupations, including the ones I'm passionate about like dance and theatre.
I've been feeling conflicted lately, as I tend to be more responsible, consider finances and make pragmatic choices, but there's that artistic and adventurous side of me that's constantly pulling. We discussed this last time and you asked me to think about how to integrate my artistic side with my need to give back and help others. I've been reflecting on that since then.
I've been thinking about ways to bring my creative and artistic side together with my professional life. I've considered creating an artistic environment in my workspace as a private practice, but I also want to pursue specific artistic activities outside of work to become a more rounded person and take my mind away from work. I was thinking about taking a painting or sculpting class and then incorporating the outcomes into my home or work.
I've been thinking about creating something like a piece of art or something similar, and I believe it would be really fulfilling for me.
I grew up in Northern California and both my parents were involved in the healthcare field. I was always proud of them and was consistently exposed to their work. I am currently working for a non-profit, but I am looking to change careers now and need some recommendations and feedback on possible paths.
My parents always stressed the importance of school and doing well. They were the first in their families to finish college and wanted something better for my brother and me. I enjoyed school, especially studying sciences like biology and chemistry, and also liked English class and working on papers.
I tried different combinations of letters, like SAI, ISA, and others, as the book suggested. I found a few options like speech therapist and teacher, but I didn't feel very connected to them.
I noticed something that really stood out for me during our conversation, and it made me feel a bit different. I've been thinking about that hexagon with all of the different letters on it that we discussed earlier. Can you remind me what those letters represent and how it's relevant to my situation?
Recently, I learned that my personality test results include an A, S, and I, with the A and S being next to each other and the I right next to them as well. I am not sure what this means for my career and environment.
I recently had an interaction with a nurse practitioner who really stood out to me. I noticed that when I was describing the situation, the quote I mentioned began with an 'I'.
I think attending an all-women's college like Spelman has played a significant role in my career, as it piqued my interest in feminist thinking and women-centered ideas. Since then, I have always been inclined towards helping women and wanting to improve their lives, given our history and background. Currently, I'm working for an organization that helps improve the lives of women in Africa, and I believe that my experiences and exposure have led me to where I am now.
I feel that the work I'm doing now is not typical for African-Americans, as I work in developing the health sector of developing countries. When I attend conferences or meetings related to my work, I don't see a lot of people like me. I think this is because when people decide to go into healthcare, they don't usually choose the nonprofit route.
When I chose to study philosophy, I wanted to feel like I was earning my education because I initially thought I wouldn't be able to attend my preferred school due to tuition costs. My parents struggled with the idea of helping me financially, which made me consider attending a Californian public school instead. However, I got scholarships, and my parents took out loans, so everything worked out. Being at school, my father's emphasis on financial responsibility also played a significant role in my decisions.
When I went to college, I was really conscious of the cost, so I felt like I needed to work extra hard to earn it. I studied at Spelman and had a great interest in feminist work and African-American history.
I scored a 27 in artistic and a 26 in social from a career assessment test. The scores for artistic and social are not that differentiated. I have looked at the booklet explaining a bit about me and my career.
I recently took a career assessment test, and the results showed that my A and S scores are very close, but quite different from my I score. The counselor mentioned that careers high in art and social aspects might be suitable for me. Can you give any advice on this and how to proceed?
I looked at my summary code and the occupations in the occupational finder, and in general, they were in the arts. One of them was a painter, and another one was a dance therapist.
I recently met with several therapists, but I didn't really feel connected with most of them. However, there are two that I felt most connected with, especially the dance therapist.
I have been asked to find the occupational quotes for the jobs I've selected using the three character code I was provided. I would like to know how this exercise will help me, and if there's any specific aspect I should focus on while researching these quotes.
As a patient, I found this assessment really interesting because even though I don't feel like the artistic stuff, like dancing and theater, is very practical for me professionally, it turned out to be part of my highest interest.
I recently took an assessment and found that my highest score was in the A, which is the artistic category. It was interesting because it was neck and neck with the S, which I believe represents social or helping professions. The whole experience was quite revealing and self-discovery.
I took a personality assessment, and my top three results were artistic, social, and investigative, with artistic as the highest, followed by social and then investigative.
I grew up in a typical environment where my mother played a more traditional role, taking care of us and cooking dinner. I'm not sure how to answer that and might need to think about it more.
When I was seven years old, my family lived in Africa for two years. My dad worked at a university in Kenya, and it was the first time I was exposed to a developing country with extreme poverty. I saw people who didn't have access to basic necessities like education. Some children had to quit school at a young age to help support their families.
When I was seven years old, I lived in Kenya where I was exposed to basic health services that didn't exist and women who had no voice in their decisions about their families. At that time, I didn't internalize all of this, but as I grew up and got more exposure to those types of cultures, I realized it was an issue.
As a patient, I described my ideal work day as a midwife, starting at 9:30 and ending at 4, but I know that's not realistic. I mentioned that I might have to work longer hours or get up at 2 in the morning if someone goes into labor. I also talked about going home, having dinner with my husband, and discussing our days before sitting by the fire with a glass of wine.
Lately, I've been feeling a bit anxious, so I decided to walk to work to get some exercise and clear my mind. I live close to my workplace, which made it convenient for me. I wore something very comfortable for the walk.
I remember wearing something comfortable and flowy, nothing restrictive like a suit. I walked to work at a clinic for women to deliver babies, like a birthing center, and was with a woman who was ready to give birth, maybe that day or the next day.
I recently had a consultation with a woman who was interested in giving birth in a tub of warm water. We talked about the birthing process, specifically water births, and how it could be a less painful experience for the mother and a smoother transition for the baby from one watery environment to another.
As a midwife, I had a conversation with a pregnant woman about her eating habits, self-care, and exercise routine. Everything seemed natural and human, which I appreciate. I also thought briefly about the experience of giving birth, but we didn't discuss that on that day.
As an African-American, I feel that we often pursue high level professions like medicine, law, or engineering to make money and support our families. This leads us to avoid careers in the nonprofit sector, which may not pay as well, but help populations we don't have any direct relation to, like people in Africa.
As a patient, I feel that within the African-American community, those with higher levels of education and opportunity do not seem to go into the nonprofit sector or help those who may not have had the same higher-level education or opportunities. I wonder how being a woman has influenced my professional roles and decisions.
I find my family history interesting. My father's family were sharecroppers from North Carolina, while my mother's family came from the West Indies. They come from such different backgrounds.
I love art and get excited when I talk about it, but I don't feel like I could be good enough at any of the art forms to really make money. On the other hand, I feel more neutral towards jobs that I perceive to be more pragmatic and responsible. I don't know how to bring my artistic passions and practical jobs together.
I am worried about whether I can have financial stability if I choose to pursue art forms as my career. I'm concerned that I might not be successful enough or find a stable job in this field.
I recently discussed the occupations I outlined in my assessment booklet during a session. I mentioned the same roles as last time: lawyer, teacher, nutritionist, social worker, doctor, and midwife.
I've had people say mean things about me, like calling me Dumbo because of my big ears, and it hurts my feelings. I usually respond by saying that I like my ears, but I'm still struggling with dealing with such comments.
I've been having a hard time handling people who poke fun at me. Recently, while playing a game, I tried confusing them when they made fun of me for missing a catch on purpose. It seemed to work. Another time, I was pushed from behind while at my locker, and I tried the same confusion tactic by saying I liked when they did that. It left them speechless. But I'm still struggling.
I have a friend, David, who sometimes helps me deal with people I don't like. He would walk up to them, ask for a kiss, and they would get disgusted and leave. Is this a healthy way to handle these situations?
I have this strategy where I get all the girls off the playground, and then me and my friends take over for games like kickball or football. I also meet with Kim sometimes, who works with my mom.
I am a patient who has been struggling with getting homework done and dealing with teasing from other kids. Recently, I talked to a counsellor about it and shared some of my strategies that I use such as the confusion strategy. The counsellor wrote me a letter and asked me if I would be willing to be in her helper club, so she could call me for ideas when she meets with other students facing similar challenges.
I work with a lot of people who deal with teasing and they really really have trouble with it. I also work with a lot of people who have problems getting their homework done. I have no email, but could you help me if I called you and asked you for ideas?
I have a friend who was in the football team but didn't make it due to being overweight. He's in sixth grade now, and last year he weighed around 210 pounds. Nobody likes him, and he struggles with getting encouraged to do things.
I feel like my mom doesn't really understand my homework struggles, and I also face teasing from people who don't like me for some reason. They make up stuff about me and I end up losing friends because they believe those lies. I don't know what to do.
I think I could control it very easy because I know most of the kids in my class. Most of them are my friends, but if one person said this and one person said that, then it goes all around the classroom, and then I'm stuck in the middle.
I filled in as a quarterback, but didn't throw many passes. In our last game, I scored a touchdown as a wide receiver. Besides football, I like playing basketball and baseball.
I am the guard on my basketball team, and I understand my big responsibility on running the offense. I have experience in playing basketball, and I also love baseball. I used to play centerfield, but now I am a shortstop after I showed my coach I could beat out the previous shortstop.
I just showed him I could play, he let me play it once and I had a bigger throw than him. I usually kind of hot dogged it, like flipped it out of my mitt, caught it. I think a couple of times our games got taped, but they- I don't think they were ever on tv.
I am facing issues at school where girls make fun of my ears out of nowhere, calling me 'Dumbo'. It's really hurtful. Also, I have a hard time getting my homework done because as soon as I come back home and take a shower, I feel exhausted and can't do anything else.
I recently played football as a quarterback and wide receiver. I played more as a wide receiver since my friend, who was the quarterback, got bad grades and was removed from the team for a week.
I tell my mom that I will do my homework after playing with my friends for a short time, but she doesn't believe me. I always complete my homework quickly and get good grades, but my mom still doubts me and doesn't let me go out.
I am worried that my mom would find out about my missing assignments, as two missing assignments lead to a detention and there's a form that has to be signed by my mom and my teacher. I've had a detention once due to misunderstanding with my teacher, and now I use an assignment notebook to keep track of completed assignments which my teacher and mom signs.
The tennis and golf activities my mom put me in don't interest me that much, and to be honest, I struggle with golf. Regarding homework, my mom thinks it's very important, like a ten on the importance scale, but for me, it's more like a one.
I can usually finish my homework in just 10-20 minutes, but my mom thinks it should take me an hour and a half. I even managed to get an A on a test without studying. The teacher allowed me to skip a study session, and I still aced it. My mom and I sometimes discuss my homework habits.
Recently, I was able to tame the teasing of other students by coming up with creative ideas like the confusion strategy. I'm feeling proud but also a bit curious about how things will turn out.
I'm going to the science center next week, where I am looking forward to an experiment. In this experiment, we will be mixing hot and cold colors, such as red, violet red, orange, and violet orange.
Sometimes I don't understand my homework and even my mom can't help me when she tries to.
I'm struggling with my homework, especially in spelling. I have a B in the subject, but there are some things I don't understand. For instance, our homework requires us to find all the words that have an S like in 'sell' or C like in 'cell'.
Sometimes, during tests, I tend to blank out and forget answers. Recently in a science test, I had difficulties in remembering the hinge joint in the five joints. But eventually, after some thinking, the answer popped up in my mind. I think my ability to handle pressure while playing sports might help me in such situations.
I've noticed that when I'm in a tough spot or someone is teasing me, I tend to panic. It happened in school and even in sports. It's like how my friend Scott handled the quarterback position - he would fumble and throw the ball away because of panic.
I sometimes do unpredictable things to confuse people, especially during activities like playing football. I'll drop the ball on purpose, and it causes them to have confused reactions. I'm not sure if this should worry me.
Lately, I've been dealing with instances of teasing at school by using confusion techniques. For example, when playing two-hand tag, if someone tags me and asks why I dropped the ball, I just say I missed it. They get confused and don't know what to do. I have a friend who got glasses and was teased, and I tried helping him by suggesting they don't look stupid on him. Are there other ways to help kids deal with teasing?
As a patient, I've been dealing with teasing by trying to make others laugh with me before they laugh at me. Like, when I got glasses, I wore a funny big pair first to make them laugh, and then they accepted my real glasses without making fun of me. I don't read books on dealing with teasing, I just come up with these ideas on my own.
When I have a test and I forget something, I just sit there, wait a minute, think, then it just pops up.
I recently had a conversation with my mom and teacher about getting my homework done in an acceptable way. We had a system in place that everyone understood. However, I am unsure if I want to continue with this experiment. In school, we had a science project involving worms, which helped me understand the concept of experiments.
I'm curious about how this homework experiment is going to work and what will happen if it doesn't work. I wonder what ideas Kim Snow will have and if the experiment works, will we continue it? What will life be like when my mom and I are not arguing as much about homework? How will that make things different at home and at school? I also received a letter asking if I want to be in Dr. Murphy's helper club, but I'm not sure if I should sign it.
I have been feeling unstable lately and struggle with discussing financial issues with my partner. I am not sure about the right time to approach him about the spending, but I might try talking to him tonight when he gets home. I am not confident if my attempts will be effective, as he usually does what he wants.
I feel stuck because I don't want to get into other things with my partner right now, as I am not ready to make those steps. However, I am willing to talk with him about the spending.
I can tell when my partner is open to talking about finances if he doesn't seem stressed out and is in a positive mood. I notice this when he comes in smiling and describes having a decent day.
I recently attended a skills group and it was okay. I have been in the group for four or five times and I'm still learning. It's helpful to see the skills around the room so I can understand what people are talking about. There are a couple of new clients in the group, and it's interesting to see how they have their own set of issues to work on. I feel like I've been there longer than I actually have since I see the difference.
This week, I practiced the opposite to emotion skill that we talked about. For example, on Tuesday, I didn't feel like going to the group, but I acted opposite to that because I knew I had made a commitment to you, the group, and myself.
I recently started practicing the opposite to emotion technique we discussed, and it has helped me honor my commitments better. I wonder if there are other areas in my life where I could use this skill?
I'm Laura, and during my session with my counsellor, we practiced mindfulness and deep breathing. I found it relaxing, but I admitted that I don't often take breaks like that in my day-to-day life.
I felt that the breathing exercise took forever, like five minutes, but actually it was only a minute. Sometimes when I do breathing exercises, it makes me feel anxious, but this time, breathing in, stopping, and exhaling actually helped me feel more relaxed. I'm not sure why sometimes thinking about my breath makes me feel anxious.
As a patient, I have been asked to observe and describe my distress levels before engaging in positive activities and then notice where my distress levels are at after engaging in those activities for some time. I'm also supposed to cross-reference information from the chain analysis with the BOR safety plan.
I thought the session was okay and I had an alright experience with group therapy. However, I'm still unsure whether this therapy will really fix anything for me, but I'm willing to give it a try.
I've had a session with my counsellor, and as I was leaving, they suggested that before getting in my car, I should take a few moments to sit on the bench outside and practice mindfulness and breathing exercises.
I just wrapped up my session with my counsellor, and they said it was great to see me today and they'll be coming to see me next week. I feel positively about the session.
I feel uncomfortable talking about a certain issue and would prefer not to engage with it. I have been working on a safety plan, but I haven't added the new skills I learned this week to it.
I acted on my SAB the other day, and I think it's probably the most important thing we need to address today. I also feel like some of my concerns will be covered in the chain analysis.
I have recently started attending counselling sessions, but I am not very familiar with the process yet. My counsellor mentioned that when I have a self-entry during the week, they want me to start filling out some forms at home and bring them in partially completed.
As a patient, I'm wondering if we can focus on positive behaviors in our counseling sessions, because talking about negative things can make me feel uncomfortable.
I went to the beach recently, which I don't do often. It was a really positive experience for me.
I don't know if I have time to make it back to the beach, but I can take my dog for a walk. I could probably do it before group on Monday. I try to do more often than that, so I can for sure tell you that that's the time that I know I can do it.
I have plenty of time, but I can't tell you exactly when right now. Also, I am not sure if I can make it to the beach. If I had a good book, I might be able to read.
I could put it in a box in the laundry room. But I'm not sure how to minimize the impact of some of the negative outcomes that I've been experiencing, like avoiding talking about it and not needing to cover it up.
I was startled awake in the middle of the night by some commotion. I was initially surprised, then felt angry and frustrated because this has been happening every Thursday and Saturday. My partner is the cause of the disturbance, and he does this a lot.
I was startled awake and felt angry, frustrated, and thought 'here we go again.' Is there anything else I should notice underneath the surface?
I have been feeling disrespected and uncared for by my partner because of his behavior. This makes me feel like he doesn't respect our relationship or care about me. When I confronted him, he was drunk and angry, putting the blame on me and refusing to address the issue.
I'm worried about whether my relationship will stay together or not down the road, but I don't want to get too in depth with that today.
I struggle with getting enough sleep, and sometimes I go to bed later than I should. I can't help it if I am woken up during the night, but I guess going to bed earlier could be one thing for me to work on.
I would like to not take medication, like Ambien, and I am hoping I can find other ways to deal with my issue.
I think I could probably talk with my partner about finances, we have discussed it before, and when he is not drunk, he's more understanding. Though I'm afraid there's no way for me to separate our finances currently as it could lead to a bigger issue, I can still talk to him about his spending and see what happens.
I'm feeling really stressed about my financial situation and my job security. My husband spends too much money at the bar and recently he came home drunk again. On top of that, we got an unexpected bill that he didn't tell me about. I'm constantly worried about whether I'm going to have a job next year or not, as my role as a school assistant is uncertain.
Lately, I've been feeling stressed about my finances and my relationship with my partner, Kevin. Whenever something happens with Kevin that involves spending money, it feels like it's poking at my set of stressors. I'm starting to wonder if Kevin and I will even stay together. I know I need to address this issue with him, but I'm not ready to do that yet.
I feel like I need a soothing distraction when I'm stressed out. People talk about journaling a lot, would that be helpful for me?
I am trying to lower my vulnerability to self-injury. I'm avoiding what I use to self-harm, but I don't know how to ensure I don't go where it is.
I have been keeping a razor for self-harm in the bathroom, and I am not ready to get rid of it. I am hesitant to move it out of the bathroom even though it would create a barrier to acting impulsively. I feel like the drawer is already a barrier.
I am struggling with overcoming a barrier in my life, and I realize I need to give it some thought.
I feel like I cannot go home now because every day I just feel so bad that I'm lying to her and it's really hard for me.
I have a Chinese gay friend, and he came out to his parents. I am worried about acceptance and fear of potential consequences, like homelessness, due to this fear.
I'm afraid of my parents not talking to me anymore after I come out, like it happened with a friend. I want my mother to be happy, but at the same time, I want to be happy too.
I recently connected with a gay male, who is also Chinese, and found out about his experience of being rejected. This has made me fear rejection even more.
I've been having a difficult time coming out to my parents as a gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender person. I feel that within my culture, this is particularly challenging. How can I bridge this gap while still valuing my culture?
I'm trying to affirm my identity, but it's difficult with my mother's grieving process. I find it hard to step away as her child and deal with my own emotions. Are there any resources, particularly books, that can help me during this time?
I am struggling with the coming out process to my family. I've read some books, but not all of them have been helpful. Is there any other resource I can look into that might help me?
Lately, I've been feeling very overwhelmed with work and personal life, leading to constant stress and anxiety. It's affecting my sleep, concentration, and I'm constantly irritable. I really need some guidance on how to cope with it.
I think that's symbolic of me being off centered, I think that's is a symptomatic evidence where I'm sitting in. It seems that when I'm just decisive, I set my sights on something and I just go for it. But right now, I really don't know. I don't have anything in my sights. Everything is on autopilot.
I feel most satisfied when I complete a task on my list, but I often get overwhelmed when I have my iPhone because there are so many applications that are supposed to help me organize my time.
I'm trying to find the right project management app, and I've downloaded so many. I think that making a list of all my projects, putting them on a calendar, and knocking them out will help me find peace.
I always felt like I couldn't live up to my family's expectations, and I struggled to do things that they did for me. My father has been a sort of guardian angel to me, and I'm trying to be more open to the possibilities of relationships.
I have a little doubt in myself that I follow through. I'm worried about developing short term memory loss. If I can remember how hard I felt and recall the effective relationships, it helps a lot.
I've been working on making a change in my life, hoping that it becomes automatic soon, but until then, I know I need to put in the effort. I'm open to discussing my situation and answering any questions about it.
I've been trying to meet expectations and get things right, but it's been difficult. My father showed me that people are still lovable with their mistakes, and I'm trying to relax and enjoy life more. After his death, I started thinking about how our love for him never changed, even though his appearance did.
I needed my instrument for practice, but it was locked up in our high school band room. I knew how to get in, so we took our instruments. During practice, the police showed up and accused us of stealing them. My friends were horrified, but I didn't feel bad. When they called my house, my brother answered and said they had the wrong guy.
I feel like I've made it impossible for myself to have successful relationships. When I listen to what I'm doing, it seems like I'm shutting off the possibility somehow, but I can't put my finger on it. Some of my most successful relationships happened when I wasn't looking for one and when I was centered with what I was doing at the time.
I was just there for a week, visiting a friend, and I wasn't supposed to be at that party. It was so long ago, but there was this undeniable attraction between us two. It felt easy and natural, and we didn't have to work for it. But it's sad that it fell apart. As for my ex-wife, I met her at a pizza hut where I was a waiter. We just joked around and her friends left her number for me. I called her that night and we went out to a movie.
I never thought I was short until I went online dating. I knew my height, but it didn't matter much to me. Before, I was a hardworking, productive guy, with high integrity, and someone everyone could trust. I had a lot of friends, and even girls were allowed to go out with me because I was safe.
When I was younger, I was a very productive child and focused on my studies, not dating much in high school. I was fairly shy, and during the time I was most interested in dating, my father was diagnosed with cancer and struggling for years. I found myself diving into productivity, possibly as a way to distract myself from the pain and denial.
I have been under a lot of load between work and school, trying to do as much as possible. I did manage to date a little bit, and even got engaged to a girl I fell in love with during spring break. However, when I went to graduate school in Michigan and she started her professional career in Florida, our relationship fell apart. I feel like I have been avoiding dealing with my father's death as well.
I was a waiter when I met my former wife in Indiana, after moving from Michigan. We were both short back then and our relationship developed quickly. I felt like we connected easily.
I went to a competition and saw that the other competitors were much better than me. I prepared for 24 hours and managed to do something harder than I had ever done before, but I still didn't feel good enough compared to the others. I was offered a smaller role, but had to decline it because it was too physically demanding. I was discouraged at first, but challenged myself and now feel more confident in my skills.
After going through a divorce, my ex-wife had an affair and left me with the responsibility of raising our three kids aged one and a half, three, and six. For the last 11 years, I've been raising them on my own. In the beginning, I felt really crashed and even had to stop my practice as I couldn't focus. A good friend of mine thought that I'll be very busy with everything.
I've been working really hard lately, changing ducts in my friend's attic and taking care of my kids. I have this vivid imagination of mowing the lawn with my one and a half year old in a snugly, my 3-year-old in a back carrier, and my other child by the window where I can see her.
I used to be very trustworthy and kept my word, but over the last six months, I've felt discriminated against, and it's affecting my online interactions and confidence in myself. I've never felt this kind of self-doubt before.
At Florida State University, I was in the snare line for four years in high school. Our school had a top football team and our marching band was pretty good too. I thought I became better by being in the marching band.
I don't want my kids to suffer at all, and I don't want them to have any troubles, but life just seems to hand us troubles. I tried to protect them, but it didn't work.
I've been feeling down lately and struggling with self-criticism. It's affecting my relationships and I often feel like nobody wants me. I came to you for help, and you suggested an assignment for me to go to the shopping mall or airport, observe people in relationships, and try to realize that there are people with flaws who are still loved.
When I was younger, my father, who was a psychologist, and I used to make monthly trips to the store together. He was financially well-off, and we lived at a nice beach house. During these trips, we would always get three things - a paperback book for my father, a sirloin steak from the butcher, and Breyers ice cream.
I adored my father more than anyone in the world, but he would sometimes do things that would rub me the wrong way. I think he was trying to teach me to love someone immensely in spite of their mistakes, but I still haven't mastered it. What advice would my father give me now if he were here, given what we've discussed about my life and current frustrations?
When I think about what someone might advise me at this point, I think they would say, 'do what you've always done.' In this situation, that means I should trust myself.
I notice that I haven't planned to be centered while doing my thing, but I think it should just happen naturally. I'm also realizing that getting out of the office and doing many things is essential for my projects.
I'm in a situation where the things at home seem to affect my mood, and I'm not sure how to handle it. I guess I need to explore the world more and let someone see the real me. This strategy has worked before, but I'm kind of nervous about it.
I've been working hard and distracting myself after recovering from a difficult time. I feel like I'm in a good place relationship-wise now, but I still struggle with the effects of what my kids have been through.
I find it difficult to handle the troubles my kids go through in life, like being bullied, heartbreak, or the way my marital troubles might be influencing them. It saddens me, but I understand that these experiences shape them as individuals.
I want you to help me become more relaxed, yes. I don't want to be so defensive with you. I don't like to feel so defensive.
As a patient, I am feeling quite upset because I was called a phony by someone for smiling when I'm embarrassed or put in a corner. I admit that I find it hard to show my embarrassment, but I don't think it's fair to call me a phony.
I feel like you're picking on me and I want to pick on you too. However, I have to wait until you say something that I can pick on. I'm struggling to find words for my feelings, and I wish I could start our interaction all over again.
I'm scared and suspicious of you. I think you understand that when I get scared, I laugh or kid to cover up. I'm afraid of your direct attack and want you to be more on my side. I feel like going back to a corner where I'm completely protected.
I know I wouldn't really feel safe, but being in a corner feels safer for me. This reminds me of when I was a little girl, and every time I was afraid, I'd feel better sitting in a corner, but panicky.
I am a 30 year old woman and I feel afraid of you. I become really defensive in this situation. I don't know why it reminds me of something.
I feel so dumb and stupid because I don't have the right answers. This makes me feel inferior to others, like I have to look up to them because they're smarter.
I had a feeling I could be afraid of you, as you seem like someone who demands a lot of respect. I think my fear has to do with my father, but I don't feel like I demand respect personally.
I feel that if I put myself in a vulnerable position, you won't help me at all. I can't seem to live up to your expectations, and I tend to wait in my safe corner until someone comes to rescue me.
I feel like you're calling me phony for admitting my vulnerabilities and waiting for someone to help me. I'm being honest about my situation and resent being judged for it. I think I'm just as real sitting in that corner as I am standing on my own.
I feel like you don't like me right off the bat, and I want to know if you do. I think you'd say that I'm a phony, flip little girl, and a show off.
I feel like you're showing off and acting like you know all the answers. It makes you seem less human to me, like you're trying to find a reason for every little action I take.
I want you to acknowledge and accept my physical behaviors like kicking my feet and giggling when I'm nervous, without putting me on the defensive. I don't want to have to explain why I'm doing these things.
I don't think I'm playing stupid, but the counsellor seems to suggest otherwise. I just did something with my hair during our conversation, and he asked if there was something in his hair that I object to, but there's nothing.
As the patient, I feel like we found some closure and understanding during our conversation. It seems like a good point to end the session.
As a patient, I feel like you're judgmental, and I don't feel close to you at all. I think you've never felt the way I feel, and you just pass judgment on people like me. It seems like you're playing a game and lack genuine feelings.
I can't help but feel irritated with people who act cocksure and smart, like they have all the answers. I'd like to embarrass them and show them that they can be just as phony as anyone else. There's this person who looks distinguished, and I feel like it's just another advantage they have.
I feel like you're not recognizing me at all, Dr. Perls, and it makes me mad. You seem so detached and you don't even seem to care that I'm upset with you. I feel like I'm not being heard.
I feel nervous about driving on my own, and I worry that I might panic and have to pull over. But talking about it and practicing breathing exercises make me feel more confident.
I get really anxious while driving, especially by the bank. I'm afraid that I might panic, lose control, and possibly cause an accident. I've been working on some coping strategies but I'm still quite worried.
I have been experiencing nightmares and sweating, and I avoid thinking of the traumatic event I had. My husband suggested I seek help. Can my condition be treated?
I'm feeling a bit nervous, my anxiety is about a three or four. I might need to take a break if I get too overwhelmed, but I'll try to remind myself of the positive self-statements I've learned.
I guess so, sure. Is this about that material you asked me to read about the ways uhm, that thinking can trigger anxiety? I read about biased thought patterns and remembered something about catastrophizing or filtering, and black or white thinking, and discounting, and several others.
I am struggling with thoughts of a traumatic event and I believe that if I think about it or talk about it, I will get upset and fall apart, just like I did during the incident. I end up shaking and crying, and it's just awful. This makes me scared, and I tend to avoid thinking about it.
I'm feeling nervous about trying the Guided Self Dialogue approach to cope with situations that I'm avoiding. I recognize that although I might panic, it's not likely that I'll lose control. But I'm still nervous that I won't handle it well.
I feel anxious about driving, and I'm afraid that I might panic while on the road. To cope, I think I would just pull over if it got bad until I could calm down.
I have a fear that if I talk or think about a traumatic event I experienced, I will lose control and break down. However, I have talked about it with you, and although it's not easy and initially made me nervous, I've been able to do so without breaking down.
I experienced a traumatic event and now I find it hard to talk about it without fear of losing control. I keep catastrophizing and it's making me avoid talking about the trauma. What can I do to overcome this?
As a patient, when I returned from deployment, I found it difficult to adjust to my surroundings, feeling like the world was spinning around me. I wish for a welcoming environment, like someone walking up, shaking my hand, and saying 'welcome home, brother'. I also find comfort in connecting with fellow veterans, like discussing our experiences while seeing the eagle globe.
I've found that being around other Marine veterans helps me cope with my issues. We don't even need to talk about our feelings or struggles, just being around each other is comforting. I don't see them very often, though. Do you think being around other Marine veterans regularly would be helpful?
As a patient, I tried joining the Marine Corps League for support, but it mostly consists of older gentlemen. I have looked into the Vet Center, but honestly, we marines are quite selective and prefer the company of other marines. There are a few programs available on base, but they seem too distant. What else can I do?
Lately, I've been participating in the Wounded Warrior program in my community. I know that every program has its positives and negatives, but I wanted to explore this program further.
The three things that really get on my nerves are being asked if I took my meds, if I killed anyone, and being told 'thank you'. Instead of saying 'thank you', you suggested saying 'welcome home' in one of our sessions, which really resonated with me because it acknowledges the difficulties I went through without being intrusive.
I find myself feeling hopeless and negative about the world, and it leads to depression. I recall shutting myself in a dark room for the first six months of my son's life and feeling like a failure as a father. I have been near gunfire and grenades, and I suffer from constant migraines. On top of that, the medicines I take cause weight gain, and I've gained 80 pounds which makes me feel even worse about myself.
I have been experiencing side effects from the medication I'm taking, and it's really frustrating. I went to the military to protect the country and help my fellow comrades, and I did a good job while I was there. Now, I'm back and facing these issues.
I have taught myself not to feel emotions, but I can easily tap into feelings of sadness, depression, and remorse. It's hard for me to find joy or see any ray of light, except when I'm with my kids. But then, I start looking at them and my mind starts taking me to thoughts of possibly taking opportunities away from someone else.
I feel joy when I'm with my children, but it fades when I think about other people who cannot be with theirs, especially when I think about teenagers fighting in the marines. I try to give my kids a typical American life, but I feel remorse for what I did during my service, taking away such opportunities from others. It's been 14 years since I returned, but this feeling didn't hit me until my son was born.
I've found that playing guitar has become my self-soothing technique and it helps me cope with challenges.
I have been feeling like a monster looked upon by society because of my experiences as a veteran with PTSD. I struggle with people asking me if I killed anybody and it makes me really uncomfortable. Even when someone thanks me for my service, it feels awkward as if I did it for the title of hero or for the glorification.
Lately, I've been struggling with the lives I've taken during my service. It's become very personal and difficult, especially during family gatherings and holidays. I feel out of place at my in-laws and undeserving of being there since I have taken that right from someone else.
I've been attending therapy and working on medication management, but I'm still struggling with my PTSD. I've heard about eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and I'm wondering if it could help me. Are there any other coping techniques you could recommend?
One thing I learned for self soothing is my marine buddy told me, he's like, I want you to play guitar, that would help me. So I started playing about five years ago. Now I have 12 guitars, and I play every day for my kids. And I started to research on guitarist rivets and it's actually a movement out there of getting vets just to start on guitar.
I don't really think about suicide, but I want to be left alone on an island. I don't like being around people, crowds, and certain cultural aspects, but I endure it for my kids. At night, I can't relax and my mind constantly races with thoughts and scenarios. I've recently started medication to help slow my mind down.
I feel like people see me as a scary and untrustworthy person, causing pain and suffering. I don't see myself that way though. I am trying to be a good father to my son by playing with him and his toys because I don't want to appear as a monster.
I have been struggling with feelings of remorse since my son's birth 5 years ago. When I held him for the first time, it triggered my PTSD that I've been trying to repress for years because my ex-wife told me to keep it quiet. Recently, I was fired from my job when they found out I had PTSD since it's considered a high risk factor for insurance, and since then, I've been nervous to talk about my PTSD and related issues.
I'm worried about telling my new job about my weekly therapy sessions, as I fear this personal information might be used against me.
I've been struggling with the meaning behind certain phrases like 'thank you for your service' when it comes to my military background. I'm realizing that I didn't serve just for patriotism but for the brotherhood and bond of the people I served with. I'm also grappling with the idea of being a monster and trying to protect others through my hyper vigilance or hyper awareness.
As a patient, I struggle with hyper alertness, which is a result of my military service. It's challenging for me to feel secure and at ease, even when I'm in a safe environment.
I just finished a therapy session where I had to share my feelings and personal experiences. I feel awkward about it.
I feel like I can't trust people's opinions about me and I'm not sure if I want to hear what they think. It's hard for me to believe if someone says something nice about me.
I find the 'three don'ts' for talking to veterans helpful and meaningful. I think it's important to not ask them if they killed anybody and just say welcome home. I want to be open and not reclusive so that I can help my fellow brothers and sisters.
I've been recently reminded of some past issues, and it's caused these old feelings to resurface, making me feel like a monster again. I've been having sleepless nights, getting agitated easily, but at work, I am able to focus on the job. I like my new job, but I'm afraid to tell them about my past because I don't want to be judged. How do I deal with this situation?
I served as a veteran and when I came back from deployment, I couldn't relate to any of my friends or people my age. They don't appreciate life or the opportunities given to them. I feel like I have changed and there's a gap between me and them now.
I'm a high school senior and I've been feeling isolated lately. I know I should check out the Vets Center for a marines group to connect with others, but I'm having trouble finding the time with my busy schedule.
As a patient, I feel lonely and don't want to show weakness or emotions around other marines. I find it easier to express sadness and remorse, rather than positive emotions. But at the same time, I don't like being in crowded social situations.
I have been feeling lonely and isolated, and I find it hard to connect with people. I might have one or two people in my life, but I feel like they're not enough to counteract my loneliness.
I remember feeling intense anger for the first time when I was five years old. It was actually my mom who was angry, not me. I was in my room playing with my toys when she came in and started yelling at me, but I didn't know why. I was confused.
I remember when my mom was really angry at me while playing with toys, and she was yelling at me to clean up. I was scared and confused, so I started crying and felt paralyzed. A memory that came to mind was when my mom walked out on me, which felt similar.
I noticed similarities between my mother walking out on our family years ago and me walking out on my friends recently. I didn't make the connection before, but now I see the parallel.
Last week, I remember feeling extremely angry and out of control during a fight with my boyfriend. Although we had already resolved a previous argument, he became sad and uncommunicative during our trip to the beach. I became frustrated with him for not sharing his feelings, so I left to walk around the neighborhood for about ten minutes to calm down. I managed to calm down a little bit, but ended up saying some regrettable things and even punched a wall.
Lately, I had an argument with someone that made me angry, but we came back and smoothed things out by avoiding talking about the situation that led to the anger.
I struggle with anger issues, especially when it comes to my boyfriend. Sometimes, I end up punching a wall or walking away. I want to find a solution to this problem, but I feel helpless.
I think the most frustrating part last week was that my boyfriend's anger was unexpected. I thought we had solved our issue and were going to have a good day, but his unhappiness came out of nowhere and ruined everything. It reminded me of when I was five and didn't know what to do when faced with unexpected anger.
I feel helpless when my boyfriend shuts down and stops talking. I know he's feeling bad and I want to help but I don't know what to do. He isn't talking, which makes it even harder for me to figure out what to do. This frustrates me and eventually, I have to leave.
I remember sending two emails to my professor. In the first one, I politely asked for feedback on my paper for the speech pathology class, expressing my desire to do well. In the second email, however, I complained about their lack of professionalism due to not responding promptly.
I recently got frustrated when my professor didn't respond to my email. I feel guilty about the way I handled the situation, and I'm not sure if my feelings were valid or if it was just my behavior that was wrong.
This week, I had an incident with one of my professors. I e-mailed her about reviewing a paper for her class, but she didn't respond. So, I got angry and sent a message in all caps to get a prompt response. She replied, but said she was unhappy with my email and that it was unprofessional. I really respect this professor, so it hurts to hear these critiques, making me feel like I'm not making as much progress as I thought.
I thought I'd sent that e-mail and kind of guilt and you know just feeling overall bad that I kind of let myself up into that behavior again. I really feel like I let myself down. I am also feeling some shame.
I came to counseling to work on becoming a better communicator. I recently regret sending an email to my professor asking her to look at my paper, as she didn't get back to me in a timely manner. I feel comfortable with the first email I sent.
I'm feeling like maybe I haven't been making progress in communicating effectively, but at the same time, I feel good about having some skills to put into practice.
As the patient, I just said, 'Okay, sounds good.'
But I think, I think it's, it's, it's just hard for me because I don't want others to feel like they can just kind of like walk all over me and just get back to me whenever she wants. So it's like I'm aware that I can do it but I'm afraid that you know, my anxiety about needing to get things done when I feel like they need to be done…
Hello, I just want to touch base with you about a paper I sent to my professor earlier. I know she's very busy, but I would really appreciate it if she could let me know when she will be able to get that paper back to me. I felt better after realizing she's busy just like I am, which changed my perspective a little bit.
I had feelings about getting angry that she didn't get back to me right away, so I should probably be a little bit more sensitive to that.
I have been dealing with unresolved feelings towards my father. I want to move forward and let go of the past, but it's hard, especially when he continues to reach out. I don't know if I can ever develop a relationship with him.
I don't wish my stepfather well, and the thought of sending him a bland holiday card seems difficult for me to do.
I'm having a hard time dealing with my strained relationship with someone, and I recently received an invitation to their wedding. This really upset me, and I even told my wife that I'm not going to that unpleasant person's wedding, using some harsh language. I haven't talked to her about my desire to let go of this resentment.
For the past year and a half, I have been feeling angry and awkward about my relationship with my father since we had a falling out. It affected my wedding, making it a very awkward event even though my wife is very supportive and understanding. I try to forget about it and not talk about it, but the anger seems to linger and I worry about how it will affect our future if we have children.
I feel, I feel angry and, uh, but nervous at the same time.
Last summer, my father confessed to having an affair. I was staying at my parents' house for a while, and it caused a lot of tension between them. I still feel extremely angry about it and don't talk to him much. When he calls, I'm cold with him. If I had to rate my anger on a scale of zero to 10, I'd say it's about a six.
As I talk about him, I close my eyes, smile, hesitate, and lose eye contact with you. It's awkward to discuss this in front of an audience, but I still feel some pain about the situation.
I can't stop smiling because I feel very awkward, and my stomach is a little bit tense, and sweaty palms and things like that, just unpleasant physical reactions. I still ruminate about my father's affair and the child he had, which I only found out about last year. It affects my life and my relationships, and I have trouble moving on from it.
It's tough for me to think about forgiveness, even though I know its benefits. I think forgetting would mean not having any thoughts about it and pretending that everything's fine. But it's not easy for me to forget the affair my dad had, which led to my parents' divorce and affected my life.
I don't think his behavior was fine, and I don't think it'd be possible to just ignore it and pretend that nothing's going on. I'm still experiencing anger and hurt from the situation.
I've been feeling really angry lately, and I know it's not good for me in the long run. But I don't want to feel like a victim in this situation. My anger stems from a strained relationship, and I recently got invited to his wedding, which made me tense. I know that resolving the relationship is important, but I don't like the idea of giving him a gift.
Lately, I've been struggling with gift-giving. I understand its value since I've had an experience with it before, but that doesn't seem to make it any easier for me.
I'm hoping my father wasn't trying to hurt me. It was probably due to his biological drives and environment. But it doesn't make it any easier to accept and deal with it. It's hard to think about it that way because it makes it easier to deal with and kind of clinging onto the anger right now. He was a victim of his environment because maybe he's done this before and got away with it, and the marriage between he and my mother wasn't great.
I am not sure what it is about the year, but I've noticed that I enjoy events like meeting an old friend, but at the same time, I wouldn't want to embarrass them. It's strange that this pattern seems to emerge right around each year.
I'm trying to understand why I often trip-up in my progress. I want to ask about this issue during my next session so I can work on it.
I want to be motivated more positively to sustain the good things in my life rather than just avoiding problems. I feel like I was pushed into seeking help, but I want to be more proactive.
I was honest with the doctors about my drinking habits, but they never addressed my alcoholism directly. I knew I had a problem, even without a formal diagnosis. After a car accident related to my drinking, I don't want a third incident to happen.
I'm worried about opening up some can of worms that I may not be able to handle. I've had a long history of drinking, in and out of the program, and experienced various unrelated incidences that happened in my life. Some of those things are scary.
I was saying that participating in the meeting itself wasn't really scary, but the interaction with the sponsor and the kind of questions the sponsor would ask made me feel uncomfortable. Now, I feel slightly better since I may never see you again, which makes it different.
I can't see anybody else in here because of the lights, but I know that I am being questioned by someone I know, and I feel kinda stuck. I am worried about what he might say, like 'Well, oh my soul, you did that?'
I've never truly had a real sponsor in my recovery journey, and I'm unsure about the concept of a temporary sponsor. Is that someone I can call?
I've been struggling to find the motivation to finish tasks around the house, even though I know my wife keeps asking me to. I have enough energy since I work a physically demanding job on the dock, but I just can't seem to find any passion for other aspects of my life. It feels like my hopes and dreams are fading, and I often forget about them the next day because I drink.
I'm feeling stuck right now. I used to be involved with 12 Step programs and I really liked them, mainly because of the socializing aspect. I enjoy interacting with people, and it helps me stay out of trouble.
To me, it's a little smothering at times. After meetings, everyone wants to go out for coffee and stuff, and I'm not a fan of the hugging and touchy-feely stuff, but I enjoyed the socializing.
I have been noticing that many people around me seem to want a hug, but I feel more comfortable just giving a handshake. However, I don't feel like I can tell anyone that directly.
During my time in the Marines, I became a drinker. After I got out, family members and friends told me I should be getting tired of it. I had an incident in one of the bases and went into rehab in the Marine Corps as part of the process. It was my first experience with 12 Step, and I enjoyed it.
It seems like every time I try, I reach about a year in the process and then feel stuck. I'm not sure exactly where I am in the steps, and I don't know if it's psychological or if I'm just making excuses to drink again.
I have been sober for a year now, with no drinking at all. I experimented with marijuana in high school, but that was it. I haven't done any other drugs like cocaine.
I have been clean for a year from drugs and alcohol, but I don't necessarily follow a 12 Step program or any other specific model.
I've been making progress in my recovery, and I'm now in my ninth month where things are going well. The last time I went through this program, I got my current job that I've held for the past five years, and it's been really good for me.
As a patient, I feel that I need someone I'm completely comfortable with. However, I also understand that the person I'm most comfortable with in a support group like AA may not necessarily be the best sponsor for me.
I think I would need a friend who could be really honest with me, but I worry that I might end up being untruthful or not fully open with them. I need someone who can lay it on the line for me.
Tomorrow, I need to find out the time of the meeting in my local town and start the process of finding a temporary sponsor, and eventually a real sponsor. I don't want to rush into it, especially in the first week. I want to be comfortable with someone and not feel judged or rejected, because of something that I may have done or let happen.
I am working with the 12 Steps program and trying to understand how to approach others without being judgmental. I would never be harsh to someone, but sometimes I feel like I need others to tell me the truth directly without being too harsh on me. How can I communicate this effectively?
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with some thoughts that I can't help but think about. For example, if a friend told me he's been cheating on his wife for years, I'd tell him to stop. But sometimes I feel like I'm being judgmental on some things and not others.
I feel like something is constantly happening and I'm not sure about it. With our time almost running out, I need support from a sponsor but don't know exactly what I want from them or how they should act.
As a patient, I haven't had many counseling sessions and I don't exactly know what to expect in an interview like this. I'm not sure why I'm here and I don't know what issues I need to describe as I'm not a doctor.
I'm currently a practicing drinker and I know I have problems, but I don't know how to interpret them or effectively work through them. I've been considering getting back into 12 Step programs in my area.
I come from a big family of alcoholics, and I started drinking when I was in high school. I'd be the one at parties who they'd have to help up and take home. My drinking progressed, and it affected my performance in high school. Since I didn't do great in high school and wasn't going to college like others, I joined the Marine Corps, which seemed like a perfect place for an alcoholic.
I feel like I need to go straight from work to a meeting or find a hobby to occupy my time instead of drinking. It wouldn't be feasible for me to attend meetings every day, so maybe pursuing a hobby like landscaping, as my wife has suggested, would help me stay busy. Boredom is a big problem for me when I just sit around and think.
I often drink when I get bored, and I'm not sure why people recommend 90 meetings in 90 days. I have daughters and a pretty understanding family who can help me take care of them.
I have a wonderful family but sometimes I use them as an excuse not to attend meetings. I could do 90 meetings in 90 days, but finding babysitters can be challenging. I know I need to go, but I'm struggling to start.
I didn't drink today and it's going to be too late for me to go home and drink, so that was easy.
Recently, after coming back from a mission, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. The adrenaline has worn off and now I'm just sitting here, thinking about everything I saw and experienced during the mission. It's hard to process everything, especially when I was so focused on taking care of my tasks at the time.
I'm still affected by a past traumatic event, and I feel like my current motivations are mostly negative. For example, I only get motivated to do something during tax time at the last minute.
I have a tendency to wait until the last moment to do important things. Like my recent experience where I didn't have to rush for a task, but in the past I would always procrastinate. Even during my drinking days in the Marine Corps, I was forced to get things done due to an incident.
In the past nine months to a year, things have been happening. I got a new job after leaving the Marine Corps, but it's been a year-and-a-half already. Recently, I got into a car wreck causing some serious damage to my ear. Can you help?
I used to attend a 12 Step program, but I stopped. Recently, the issues in my house are becoming more prominent as my daughters are getting older and things like piles of beer cans on the table are not acceptable anymore. I want to take care of this and consider going back to the program.
I got stationed to Okinawa, Japan, and I picked up drinking there again. I got lucky as far as drinking goes when I got sent to Desert Storm because there was no alcohol at all. The experience made me look at the newspapers and TV and think that it was an easy one.
I was on a tank as one of the ground troops, and I made it through fine, but it's not something I would ever want to do again. Watching it on TV does not compare to actually being there in the middle of the chaos.
I had a really hard time during the war. It wasn't physically or emotionally hard until the very end when it was over. We were in a southern Kuwait city and had liberated an airport, and we were resting there. Everyone was feeling elation and you could hear the jubilation in the city.
I have been participating in both psychotherapy and 12-step programs because I believe they provide different benefits. Recently, I realized I needed to join a group of Desert Storm-era veterans because others in my circle couldn't relate to my experiences.
As a patient, I've been benefitting from attending 12 Step meetings and having a sponsor, but I feel I need more help in probing my feelings. I'm struggling with motivation and I'm not sure how to get moving.
I had a day off and went to the club to get information about my addiction. I found all the books and other resources and started reading them. My wife knows about my intention to overcome this addiction and she is fully supportive.
I was kind of joking about needing time off work to attend late-night meetings at the club. The truth is, after a long day at work, I just go home and relax. But I feel like I should be going to these meetings straight from work instead of taking time off.
As a patient, I felt that I wasn't taken seriously enough in the therapy group I attended. The atmosphere wasn't comfortable for me, and it was difficult for me to relate to the others in the group since most of them didn't share my experiences from Desert Storm. I believe that if the group was smaller, or if it was a one-on-one session with someone who could understand my situation better, I would have benefited more from therapy.
I don't know how my experience ties in, as I'm not a doctor. My friends had a different experience, while mine was painful. The ground war only lasted six days.
I would take any other six days of my life and replace those with my time in the military. I don't know if that gives you an idea of how I feel, but I wouldn't go back to the military, even if there was no combat. The camaraderie is great, but it's not the type of atmosphere I need to work on myself. It's like going out with buddies and shooting pool.
I used to enjoy playing pool, which could be considered a sport, but the places where it's played often get me into trouble. I liked being in the military, but I don't want to go back to that environment.
I've noticed that a lot of what motivates me about drinking and other things is bad consequences. When I was a child, I would do things like spending all summer trying to jump off a high dive.
I am 33 years old and I am feeling a lack of passion in my life. I read about 80-year-olds doing triathlons and it makes me wonder where my passion and drive are.
I've had a hard time feeling a sense of vitality lately because I'm always drinking. I remember a time when I could accomplish tasks like cleaning my bedroom, but now it's difficult.
I find it hard to stay motivated and I don't go out much, except for occasional dinners with my wife. My lack of motivation is especially evident since we moved into a new house, where there are many chores to do but I can't seem to get myself to clean my bedroom or do anything else.
I want to shift away from my current situation and take care of some things I need to. I have looked into meetings to attend, but it's been about a week and I need to get a pamphlet with local meetings. There's a club in the area where I plan to attend a meeting and get the pamphlet.
I've been experiencing coughing and some other symptoms at different times of the day. I know I need to go and take care of this issue as soon as possible before any severe incident or complication occurs. However, I face obstacles like feeling tired after work.
I often find myself struggling with my plan to follow through on certain tasks. For instance, I wake up in the morning regretting not taking action the day before, and then planning to do it after work. However, when I get home, I end up procrastinating and not doing it. I want to handle this issue by myself, but I realize that getting help might be important.
As a patient, I have realized that I don't need to do everything by myself. I've started asking for help, such as asking for a ride or finding out where people are in town. That's what I am going to focus on improving.
I decided to seek help and make changes because I realized that it's hard to be a role model for my children when I'm not doing the right things. I'm concerned about the impact of my negative behaviors, like drinking, on my ability to be a good role model for them.
I went for a session and the counselor asked if they talked to me about my drinking but they didn't really talk about it negatively. My children have confronted me about my drinking comparison to their soda intake.
I have a hard time with some situations, like when I can't find a paper I signed and left on the table. My life feels untidy in these moments. I want to make it cleaner for my daughters who are 11 and 12 years old. They haven't confronted me about any problems they might be noticing, but I am worried if they are seeing these issues and not expressing it.
I've been noticing that my friend's parents don't seem to be as supportive or understanding as they should be. I'm concerned about how this might be affecting my friend.
I have been struggling with addiction for a long time. I attended rehab multiple times and thought I was doing well for a while, finding a new job and apartment with my fiancé. But then I started drinking again, and I'm not even sure why.
I think at first that maybe I can get away with it, or nobody's watching. I don't know, when it gets to that point, I think to myself, 'Well, I can handle it.' But then the next day when I wake up, I say, 'What are you doing?' But there were no repercussions from yesterday, so why not today?
I've been trying to limit my alcohol intake but sometimes I just lack motivation. I know I should gather more information and be proactive, but I haven't been able to do it properly. I feel okay physically, so it's not like something terrible happened to motivate me.
Recently, I've had more time to drink and I don't want tomorrow to be an incident that makes me go back and do that or have a negative motivation, like something looming over my head.
I've never gotten a true sponsor before, but I feel good now and have a new job. I think maybe I don't need a sponsor, or any of that stuff.
I feel like being judged harshly by my sponsor is a big issue for me, but I guess it's just a risk I'm going to have to take.
I used to attend a rehab group at the Veteran's Memorial. I participated because I was a combat veteran. There were some questionnaires with unobtrusive questions, you know, nothing too invasive.
I recently joined a post-traumatic stress group after filling out a questionnaire. I was the only one from Desert Storm in the group, and everyone else was discussing their combat missions and experiences. I felt like I couldn't relate to them on that level.
No. I feel that I can probably tell you about what...is on my mind. Uhm, my problem is, uhm, that, that I can't have children. And I just went though the last series of tests. I was hoping that the doctors would tell me otherwise. But, so, I'm very, uhm, I'm just very scared to tell my husband and I just don't know how to tell him.
I have recently found out that I can no longer plan to have children, and my partner doesn't know about this yet. This has made me extremely depressed and devastated, and I'm unsure how it will affect our relationship and what it means within my cultural context.
I want to have children, and so does my husband. Within our Islamic culture, if a wife can't have children, the husband may leave her and marry someone who can bear children. I'm devastated that he might leave me, and I'll be alone for the rest of my life. It would also be shameful for him, and his manhood would be questioned.
I'm worried that my husband might leave me because of cultural differences, and I want to understand how our relationship will proceed from here.
Hi, I'm Zyra. I have concerns about the counseling process and want to ensure that I am comfortable with it.
I recently spoke with Dr. Ken about my issues, and he referred me to you. I'm hoping that you would be able to understand my culture and family beliefs. But I'm wondering, how would you be able to understand me if you don't know about my beliefs or values?
I've been really worried, nervous, and hesitant to tell my issue to somebody outside of my family.
My husband and I both grew up in different countries before coming to the US. We got married five years ago, and he was already in the US as a grad student. He eventually began working for a high-tech firm, and I joined him later on.
I am in an arranged marriage, and our family and friends thought it would be a good match because of our same culture and religion. However, I've come to realize that my spouse and I have very different perspectives on Islam, and my spouse and his family are very conservative.
I initially thought my family's values were in line with my husband's family, as they are not conservative in valuing education. I had stated my intention to pursue my education and career. But now, my husband is insisting that I have children first before pursuing further education.
I got married because it would get me closer to my goal of getting higher education in this country. But after the marriage, I committed to having children first because that was my spouse's wish. Now, I am suddenly faced with the possibility of not being able to have any children and it has been a very difficult time for both of us.
We've been married for five years and I think we have a pretty good relationship. Initially, when we were first married, we were very romantic with each other and focused just on each other. But lately, we've had pressure from both sides of our families to have children.
In the past five years, I haven't been able to have children and I haven't been pregnant. I feel that my partner, Hamid, is emotionally withdrawing and maybe sensing that I can't have children. Our relationship has been stressed lately, and along with that, I've been feeling depressed.
I'm not sure about the concept of adoption and how it would fit in with my culture, faith, and Hamid's family values.
Because within Islam, if a couple adopts a child, they can earn a place in heaven. That could be a possibility, but I'm not sure how Hamid would feel about that possibility because we haven't even talked about it. I am from Bangladesh and Hamid is from Pakistan.
I have noticed that I struggle with finding solutions that align with my cultural values. I feel lost and confused because I don't know which options are the best for me.
I'm struggling with how to tell my partner about an important decision that involves both of us, and I haven't discussed it with him yet.
I am considering coming to counseling, and I feel comfortable asking my husband to join me. I have mentioned the idea of counseling to him before, but he didn't let me know either way if he was against that idea.
I've been considering bringing my partner to the next session because I think it would be helpful for us to work through the emotional loss and grieving together, and figure out how to proceed from here. So, I'll try to talk to him about it this week, and hopefully, we'll both be here next week with you.
I was told to do an assignment where I need to talk to people, but I'm feeling a bit anxious about it.
I was in school and I saw my ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend kissing passionately near our lockers. It was really infuriating and distracting when I was trying to concentrate on getting my books out and thinking about my classes.
I had this experience about five or six weeks ago and it has been bothering me ever since. It smells really bad and I just want to get over this and move on with my life. I'm feeling so much anger about it.
I feel so much hate when I look at those people who betrayed me. Seeing them just brings back all those negative feelings, and I cannot help but feel angry.
I have been struggling a lot with getting one particular image out of my mind. It's the image of someone I care about kissing someone else, and that really bothers me. I cannot stop thinking about it.
I'm here because, I guess you can call it anger or depression. I'm furious at my ex-girlfriend and the guy she started dating after breaking up with me. We were together for about six or seven months, and about a month and a half ago, she just dumped me for this other guy who's really popular. I feel betrayed by her, and I've known the guy for several years, so it hurts even more.
I have been feeling infuriated at my friend and my ex-partner for about a month and a half now, because I found out they were involved while knowing I'm going out with my ex. I can't concentrate and I can't even be in the same room with them without feeling strong emotions. It's getting ridiculous and I just want to move on with my life and forget about it, but I can't.
I can't get over my feelings, even after a month and a half since they've been together. I just want to be able to free myself from these emotions, especially anger. Recently, I felt a lot of anger towards them, and I can easily recall that moment.
I often feel regret and anger, and it's hard to process these emotions.
I'm in the hall and see them kissing, thinking they shouldn't be doing this. He shouldn't have taken her, and she shouldn't have gone with him. I should be there. I feel so angry, probably about a nine on a scale of one to ten.
I was walking down the hall when I saw something that bothered me. I couldn't let it go and started thinking, 'She shouldn't have done that and all that.'
I tend to feel a lot of anger towards people who betray others, but when I remind myself that these situations are unfortunately common, my anger decreases. I think that, hypothetically, my anger would go from an 8 to around a 4 or 5 on a number scale. However, I assume it would take time to fully adjust my perspective and better control my emotions. Do you think practicing this mindset will help reduce my anger?
Recently, I feel regret and sadness when I think about the unfortunate situations happening in the world. I can't help but notice my face changes a bit as I get into those thoughts. It's really unfair.
I feel like you really understood my issue, and you hit it right on the head.
I'm really nervous about my son Steven coming home from the group home. He's been there for three months, but we had a tough time during Thanksgiving when he was home. We hoped he would stay there longer, but now the insurance is running out and he has to come home.
I'm worried because my son had difficulties with his youngest sister over the Thanksgiving break. They told us he had been following directions, but whenever he comes home, he seems to struggle with following directions.
It's been very frustrating for me lately. I get these moments where I just think, 'I don't wanna do this anymore.' My wife was very depressed at the beginning and had been doing well, but now I can see she's getting anxious again, and I'm worried about her.
I feel very frustrated when he is not doing what I want him to do. I just want him to listen to me.
I want my partner to pay attention to do his chores without me asking him to. He also doesn't take his medication as he's supposed to. I have to ask him multiple times, and sometimes I even have to drag him out of his room for it.
As a patient, I think I could tell my friend the story about watching cartoons like I told you. But sometimes, we forget about those good times and it's very easy to just forget them. Maybe that might be helpful to remind us of those times.
I've been going through a tough time lately, and it's really hard for me to remember the good times in my life when all of this is happening.
I don't really remember the good times anymore, my focus is always on what's going to happen next with my loved one. I'm constantly worried about when we'll get the next call for money, or when they're going to do something mischievous.
I am constantly worried about the future and what's coming next, and it's affecting my ability to enjoy the present.
I think holding on to the positive memories is helpful and probably the only thing to hold on to at times. It feels important to me.
Lately, I've been feeling anxious while waiting for my partner to come home. I can't help but worry about them, and I don't know what to do.
I really appreciate your help. I don't know what I would have done without your guidance and support.
I am a nurse and I've been focusing on caring for others all the time. Lately, I've been thinking about taking care of myself, but it makes me feel selfish and guilty, as if I'm supposed to only care for the other person.
I feel wicked, but I enjoy it. I'm enjoying thinking about being completely narcissistic, completely self-centered and into pleasure and comfort. In a way, I am being good to myself by keeping that vulnerable part of me away until it's safe because not everybody would be good to me. Not everybody would be kind. There are people who would use me up and not bad an eyelash and not even think about it.
I have been focusing on caring for myself after someone I knew died. I enjoy taking care of myself and not giving away every part of me just because someone wants it. However, I also feel like I'm missing something and want to have more in life. I don't want to just care for myself.
I can almost go back to the point where I really built up that safeguard in me when my marriage was going bad over five years ago. I could feel myself withdrawing and I have been withdrawn ever since. I don't want any more hurt. I've been aware of this for a long time but I never go beyond the awareness level. How can one stay safe and still be open?
I am comfortable in relationships as long as the focus isn't on me, especially in a romantic way. Friendship is crucial before progressing into a romantic relationship, but I struggle to move beyond friendship.
I've thought my way this far in my relationships, and I've laid the cards out, but I don't want to go any further. It's a risk for me, and I can feel that risk right now.
I'm not quite sure where to begin. Some of my concerns are that I have become very much aware of my own feelings of aloneness since my husband was killed last December. We had been separated for about four years before he was killed, and after his death, I became aware that he was really very important in my life.
I used to have my friend as a support system, and I didn't explore other relationships. But now he's gone, and I feel very frightened of new male relationships. I also feel a tremendous sense of loss since I cared for him.
I have been feeling very lonely since my partner passed away. Recently, I started going out but I still feel lonely. I haven't been dating much for the last four years, mostly focusing on work and taking care of my kids. I think I have put up a guard around myself that's keeping me in this no-win situation, and I want to break free from it.
I feel responsible for my loneliness, and part of me wants to break out of this shell or safeguard that I have been hiding behind, but another part of me is comfortable with it. It's an ambivalent situation.
I feel like saying to myself, well you got this far, that’s not so bad. But there are two parts of me, one that understands and it’s all right, and the other part that’s scared. I made a bargain with myself to be kind to myself and let the scared part come out when it's safe enough.
I feel like a part of me is in a cave, away from the rest of the world. I can't come out of that cave unless I know that it's alright and there won't be a lot of pain to greet me. So, it's up to the best of me to make sure that there are nurturing people around me.
I took a trip not too long ago and met a man who I had known years ago. He was a lovely, kind, and good person. During my drive back from his home, I felt as if my 'third eye' could come out and perceive everything. I felt so good. But when I came back home and busied myself with work, I felt that I'm back in the same predicament, consciously choosing between focusing and not.
I feel like my husband didn't genuinely care for me, and that I struggle to reveal myself to others who are too preoccupied with their own problems. After our split, I went to different functions and met people who said they would call, but I could never be sure if they actually did or if they really cared.
I don't think I really want that much from another person. I'm not even getting the morsels. I feel like I need to come out bit by bit, but it's hard to come out without a man. I don't know how to approach it without either coming on too strong or not at all.
I want to live a more fulfilling life before my time is up. I want to experience true joy and pleasure, not just surface-level happiness. I enjoy my children, but I feel like I'm missing out on deeper experiences and want to know how to access those deeper levels of joy.
I had a dream where I was on a sled with two other girls going down a snowy hill too fast. I warned them about a crash, but they didn't listen, so I got off and went down the hill by sidestepping and holding onto trees. When I reached the bottom, they had crashed. I think this dream means part of me would go too fast.
I have been feeling vulnerable, but now I am feeling angry and it feels like my therapist is getting too close to my sensitive side. This part of me keeps me lonely, and I want to push people away.
It’s like, I don’t really trust that. I can trust you to know that I can tell you this and that you, you may feel a little something about it, but what then, you know, I mean, you know, it’s a nice story, so big deal, something else to do. I'm a nurse and a psychiatric nurse, worked in psychiatric hospital last year. One of the big things there, the patients got a lot of points if they would talk in group. I mean, everybody wants you to talk, you know, that’s the good patient talks. And I thought, you know, anybody can talk. The reason why people don’t talk is not because they can’t talk is because they don’t know how people are going to respond. That’s where it’s sad.
I'm afraid of not being cared about after I reveal my true self. It's important for me to know if the other person cares or if it makes any difference to them.
Lately, I've been facing communication difficulties in my relationship, rather than any particular issue. In the past, I tried to be perfect to solve the problem, but now I think I need to be more assertive in expressing my thoughts and maybe my partner could listen to me better to avoid conflicts.
I've realized that I need to be more assertive in my relationship, and my partner needs to listen better as well. However, I do feel a lot better about the situation now, since I'm not the only one to blame.
I have been trying to improve my assertiveness, hoping that it would lead to Bryan listening more and being more responsive in our relationship. However, it doesn't seem like my efforts are making any difference. I'm not sure if I'm not doing the assertiveness thing right, or if Bryan just isn't going to make any changes.
I've been talking to people and trying to be more assertive, based on our conversations and what my friends say. However, despite my efforts, things don't seem to be changing for the better.
I'm thinking back to past fights I've had with my partner, and usually there was a period where things went smoothly. But this time, it seems different. We had one of our biggest fights, and I'm not sure if it will be okay this time.
Hi, I realized after facing some problems with my partner, we finally had some positive feelings and I want to use these feelings to make positive changes. But I'm not sure how to do it.
I have been feeling better lately, but I'm worried that my progress might be a temporary high and the cycle of feeling down will happen again because I've experienced those cycles before.
I tried to fix the problem by coming home early, but my partner didn't care about the reason why I was late. I attempted to explain, but gave up because he was too angry to listen. The reason I was late was that my boss told me I might lose my job, which made me anxious.
My partner and I had a fight because I was late. I came home early the next day, but we still argued. I tried to explain my side, but he wasn't listening and didn't care about my explanation or the fact I came home early. I eventually gave up trying to tell him.
I think the third situation was when I told him that I would go grocery shopping after work but he didn't hear me and got furious because there was no bacon and eggs in the morning. I'm pretty sure I told him that I was gonna do it.
I've been experiencing emotional breakdowns due to some factors at work, and I recently had another one.
Usually, I tend to think that it's pretty much all my fault when my boyfriend Bryan gets mad at me. I feel that I do things to make him mad, and I should know better.
As a patient, I often blame myself for things that happen, and it makes me feel bad about myself. Right now, just talking about it, I feel really crappy.
When I think it's my fault, I feel like I'm constantly trying to get it right with Bryan. I'm always second guessing myself and wondering if I'm doing what he wants me to do. This leads to me constantly correcting myself and feeling really anxious, like I'm going to mess up.
As the patient, I often second guess my actions as I believe it's my fault that makes my partner so unhappy and extremely mad.
I was worried about my friend's reaction when I decided to go ahead with something he told me I could do, but I noticed that he didn't seem angry when he said that, and there were no non-verbal clues indicating he was upset.
I believe that I am to blame for most of the problems in the relationship. He keeps telling me that it's my fault.
Every time I do something, it leads to problems in our relationship and we end up having fights. Someone told me that it is my fault, and I think it's usually because of something I did.
I feel like Bryan blames me for our conflicts and I often take the responsibility for our issues, but it's hard for me to think of any evidence that I'm not to blame or that it's not all my fault.
I feel like I should have known that my partner wanted to spend time with me, even though he told me to go out with my friends. He said 'If you wanna go, you go ahead. I don't wanna go, but you go ahead.' But now it has led to a fight.
I feel like I should've gotten a signal from him when he told me it was okay to go out with my friends, but I think I missed it.
I was feeling anxious because my partner usually gets mad when I go out with my friends, but this time, he didn't. He said yes, and I hoped it would be different this time. However, I found out later that he was still upset.
I was saying that we finally got on the right page and things are going great between us. But now, I'm wondering if I made a mistake in my logic and should've known something was wrong. What do you think?
Sometimes we have fights because of things we do, and sometimes it's not our fault. We just don't communicate well. When you say we have communication problems that lead to fights, it feels different and some burden has been lifted from me.
I feel like we both have something to work on in our relationship, not just me. We sometimes have communication problems that lead to conflict. Last week, we discussed two different possibilities – one was that I am mostly to blame for these issues.
This past week, my partner Bryan and I had about three fights. One time, I came home late without informing him and he got really mad. I feel bad about it because it was my mistake for not calling to let him know I was going to be late.
I had a fight with my partner recently. And then the next fight we had was actually about the same situation, but, like, the next day.
I had a big fight with my partner at the beginning of the week, but surprisingly, things have gone smoothly since then. I didn't think we could bounce back after that fight. Now that I think about it, there is usually a period of time when things are okay, and he's nice to me afterwards.
Recently, my partner and I have had abusive and conflictual relationships. After a big fight, we both feel bad, apologize, and then we're both on our best behavior. However, I'm not sure if this pattern is something to be concerned about.
I've noticed a pattern in my relationship where after a big argument, everything seems to be great for a while and some people call it the honeymoon phase. During this time, tensions seem to fade, and I feel like we don't need to change anything. However, if changes aren't made, tensions eventually build up again leading to another big blow up.
I guess I have made some progress in the last few weeks, but there are still some concerns.
I believe I have changed and become better, but I'm not sure about my friend Bryan. He doesn't seem willing to change, even when I asked him to come with me to see you, he refused.
I can't see myself staying in this relationship if he's gonna continue not listening to me and treating me as though everything that goes wrong is my fault.
I don't think it would be good for either of us if I stayed in this relationship. I need to make a decision and communicate it to my partner. It’s very difficult and scary, because I don't know how he's going to react. I know he's going to be mad, but I don't know what he's going to do to me.
I have been blaming myself for my friend's anger, but when I talk to my other friends about it, they can't believe I blame myself and tell me it's not my fault. Sometimes, even though I try really hard to do what he wants me to do, he still goes off on me, and I can't even see what it is that I did to make him so angry.
I've been in some conflicts recently and my friend Bryan thinks it's my fault. However, my other friends don't think it's my fault at all. Sometimes I can clearly identify a mistake I made that led to the conflict, but other times, even when I'm on my best behavior and everything is going smoothly, Bryan still gets angry at me.
I always thought that I was mostly to blame for the conflicts in my relationship, but now I'm starting to doubt that assumption.
As a patient, I'm worried about finding a relationship as a transgender woman. Can I find love and not lose hope?
As a patient, I want to share that I haven't been feeling good as a transgender woman. I often face mistreatment and it's a very common experience for me. However, I recently discovered some bars in New York that host transgender parties and meet and greet events.
I recently went to a transgender party and met some guys who were really into transgender individuals. I was approached by a guy who asked for my name and whether or not I was a working girl. I told him no, I'm just here for fun.
I sometimes feel triggered by the stigma about being transgender. I put it in my mind that I need to prove myself and be an advocate for transgender people, showing that we are not only good, but also talented. However, it's challenging to bring out these talents sometimes.
I used to be an entrepreneur, but I lost my business and it's been hard for me to adjust. I've been dealing with depression because some people have been pushing me down and stepping on me due to gender issues.
As a patient, I find it difficult to understand my employee's perspective on certain matters.
I've been hanging out with my friends and they still call me by my birth name, even though I've told them my new name. I try to ignore it and even joke with them about it, asking who they're calling, but they don't respond back.
I've been dealing with people calling me by my birth name, but it doesn't really affect me. When I transform like this, I've programmed my mind to prepare for certain circumstances that come along the way, and this is one of them. However, it's mostly related to my job.
I used to work in big companies and the human resources department knew my true gender. However, many of my coworkers didn't know about my gender identity. Sometimes, people would walk by my cubicle and unknowingly make insensitive comments.
I've been noticing people at work are always asking me if I'm Morena, which made me curious. Sometimes it gives me validation, but other times I feel negatively impacted by what they might be thinking about me behind my back. The good thing about me is that most of my friends say I'm passable.
I have been facing some issues with my documents; the only thing that's wrong is the gender mentioned on it. Instead of M, it's marked as F. This has been causing problems for me, like today when I have an interview.
Well, I would like to talk about my career and also my love life. And some of my experiences. But first of all, I want to talk about how I transformed four years ago.
I moved to America nine years ago. My family accepted me for who I am, but they did not validate me. They still refer to me by my old name, and it bothers me.
I've always felt like the doctor made a mistake when he wrote my gender on my birth certificate. I feel like my true identity is not reflected in my birth name, and it causes me a lot of distress.
I always joke with my mom about my birth certificate name, but until now, people still call me by that name. It's fine, though; it doesn't affect me as long as my mom tells me to excel and not do anything wrong.
As a patient, I would say my family is Filipino and practicing Catholics, so they can be quite conservative. They still hold on to old school beliefs, and I understand that. I feel that their religious background affects their acceptance of me in some way.
I had a job interview today and it went okay, but when I filled out the background check form, I accidentally checked the wrong gender box.
I recently had an interaction with human resources where they pointed out that I had mistakenly checked the 'M' box instead of 'F'. I explained to them that I was born male, and they seemed to be okay with it, but I heard them discussing it outside the boardroom afterwards.
I overheard my colleagues having a deliberation about me, and later someone told me that personnel would talk to me personally about some questions for a background check. But, they're not available today so it's been postponed.
I recently spoke with someone who said they would probably call me next week to schedule an appointment, but I'm not sure when they'll be available. They took all my information, but I'm feeling very skeptical about the whole situation.
I used to work in big companies before, but I saw the good opportunities that came to me and I thought I'd rather put up my own business instead of working in large companies with politics.
I told him that I want to retain my current situation because I don't have any intentions of changing it. I am content with who I am, and that's why people call me special because of this.
As a transgender person, I find it frustrating that I have to constantly think about my gender when filling out forms like passport applications or job applications, whereas non-transgender people don't have to worry about this.
I feel uncomfortable when people ask me about my sexual preferences, especially because I am transgender. I feel like I get asked too many private and intrusive questions compared to non-transgender individuals, and I just want the right to refuse answering them.
I have been able to cope with some things and try not to let things bother me, staying positive. But I have struggled with depression after losing my business, and I am concerned about preventing that from happening again.
I deal with difficult situations in my life by just smiling and telling people it's not their business. I feel like people assume that since I'm a transgender person who passes well, I don't have any problems, but I still face many challenges.
I've been facing a lot of obstacles in my life, especially when it comes to documentation and scrutiny. I feel like there's no way to escape it, and the situation often becomes overwhelming.
I changed my name legally when I came here two years ago. When I used to travel abroad with my birth name, immigration officers in other countries would often double check my identity.
I recently changed my first name legally to help me pass more easily, but my lawyer asked why I didn't change my gender as well. I told him it's because when I travel abroad, I worry about potential issues.
I am worried that if I change my gender, even after the procedure, medical scans might still show my original male genitals.
I just feel like... I don't know. I got... I have some sort of right to feeling what I feel.
I have a strong spiritual background and community, but I sometimes feel hesitant to talk about it.
Well, it's not very traditional...
I want to do workshops and talk to other black women like me about spirituality and energy work. But I suddenly felt a little bit of fear.
I often feel sad and tired, but I'm not sure if it's actually fear or depression. Sometimes it happens so fast that I can't differentiate between the emotions. It's like I go from excited to suddenly sad or afraid.
I used to feel good and had a passion, but now I'm struggling to connect with that feeling and don't know what to do.
I can imagine that things could be amazing for me.
I feel like there's no room for me to express my anger in work settings, because then I'll be labeled as the angry black woman. This adds more heaviness to my emotions, and I'm really struggling with it.
I feel heaviness as I start to unpack my emotions, and it seems like I don't have time to be sick and tired of being sick and tired. When I try to take care of myself, it gets judged, and when I get outraged by what I see around me, it gets judged too. So, it feels like I'm not allowed to experience any emotions. What's left for me to feel?
I've been feeling so heavy lately, and it takes so much energy and effort to do basic things that used to be easy for me. I am not sure when I first noticed this heaviness, but I just keep pushing through it.
I have been feeling extra pressure and heaviness for about a year now, and it's getting harder for me to manage.
I feel really under pressure to perform well at work because I am a black woman. This pressure makes it harder for me to interact with my co-workers as I feel like they are always watching my every move.
As a patient, I feel like I always have to give 150% in everything I do which is really exhausting.
I'm feeling fine but having a low energy and not been a good day due to stuff at work.
I have been having bad days recently and facing issues at work. I told you about the stuff that goes on there, but I don't know what to do anymore. I just don't know what to do. I'm not really having a lot of energy or positivity.
I feel a deep heaviness, like it weighs me down and takes so much energy.
I feel like I have to be on guard and be hyper-vigilant all the time. This constant state of alertness makes me feel hopeless and drains my energy, especially since I'm already experiencing sadness. Additionally, I'm dealing with various forms of oppression as a black, African-American woman and a lesbian.
I work in a department with all white women, and I am the only black woman. One of my colleagues often takes time off to go shopping and everyone seems okay with it. However, when I need time off for valid reasons like sickness, I feel judged and treated differently.
I constantly feel like people are watching me, waiting for me to mess up. This has been my life for a long time, and it's exhausting, especially when I'm already feeling a lot of heaviness. As a black woman, there's no room for mistakes, so I have to keep pushing through.
I never really thought about things like that before. It's like something inside me is wrong, and I feel like I'm crazy or have a mental problem. I don't want to be a part of that club.
I've been feeling like it's just me going through this situation and I'm struggling to cope with it.
I've been feeling overwhelmed by the difficulties and various people I encounter in life, like Alice down the rabbit hole. I need to cope with this while maintaining my sense of self and dealing with people's oppressive behaviors. When will I have the chance to just cry?
I feel like I can't even take a day to stay in bed without being judged as a lazy black woman, and it's just not fair. I'm tired and I just want a chance to break down.
I hope I can enjoy my life again. I would definitely be practicing my spirituality with my friends and my community. I'd be out doing the things that I love like energy work, and I would like to do that more.
I am not really using energy healing that often on myself, but I know it's helpful and part of manifesting my hopes and dreams of becoming a healer. I think I could be more involved in my spiritual practices and energy work for both myself and others.
I've been going through a tough time, and it's been hard for me to see past the heaviness. I want to believe that I can heal and move forward. Lately, I've been thinking of the possibility of becoming a motivational speaker. I know it might sound weird, given my current situation, but it's something I've always wanted to do.
As a patient, I wanted to share that I practice various types of earth-based spiritualities and women's spirituality. These beliefs are significant to me, and when I start discussing them, it makes me feel good.
I hadn't thought about it. I kinda was slacking off a little bit and, you know, I missed a couple of things and rituals that I could've gone to and, you know, and I don't meditate as much as I used to, so maybe I could start, you know, pushing myself to do that again, you know, since usually when I do it I feel so much better.
I've been feeling this heavy sadness, like a deep oppression. It's very draining and scary, and I don't know if I can handle it.
I have been trying to understand what you were saying about going down the rabbit hole, and I realized I have never thought about it that way. I have been picturing myself going down and down, but I didn't see it as a way to get transformed.
I have been feeling really low and scared lately. I am struggling to focus on my hopes and dreams, and I'm not sure how to move past this.
I feel worried about not having a support system when I start my new job as a counselor at a school in Alaska. My work schedule will be different from that of other teachers and administrators, and I'm concerned about when I'll have the time to form connections and get the support I need.
I will be going to Alaska for work soon and while it helps that I'll spend a week with all the residential staff to get to know them, the distance worries me. I'm unsure about using phone communication and I need to find alternative methods that I am comfortable with. There's so much unknown, and it makes me a bit anxious.
I think reading that chapter again might help me since it has been helpful before. Also, I want to try calling and asking more questions of some people who know about moving to Alaska. I might not get all the answers, but I am willing to learn from others.
I am feeling overwhelmed and need guidance in a formalized way, and it would be great to have someone built in as my go-to person. I think I will ask for that support.
I'm feeling ambivalent about an adventure I'm about to embark on, and I'm struggling to get myself and others ready for it. I'm also concerned about maintaining the intimate relationships I'll be leaving behind.
As a patient, I always feel like my nieces and nephews are my children, and being an aunt is a significant and enjoyable part of my life. However, I also feel concerned about their well-being, fearing that they might feel abandoned. I sometimes feel guilty about these feelings and I'm unsure of what else this might be about for me.
I'm a little scared of being responsible for all these children and I don't have any significant relationships there yet, which concerns me as people and personal growth are very important to me. I've experienced tremendous growth in the past few years and I don't want it to stop. Although people promise me that the new place is supportive and understanding, I'm still worried as it's the unknown.
In the past, I had some counseling sessions at this clinic where the counselor pointed out my hand gestures while talking about my relationship with my father. It made me realize the difficulties I had in relating to my dad. However, in another counseling session with a different counselor, I felt like I was being advised a lot, which was unhelpful and didn't address the core issue.
I feel a bit uncomfortable in this setting as it’s much different than what I am used to. I am usually in a one-on-one counseling environment and was surprised to see so many people here. It's a bit overwhelming.
As a patient, I am being informed that although our session is confidential, there are four or five exceptions. These include the tape potentially being reviewed in a classroom, breaking confidentiality if I become a danger to myself or others, reporting any child or elder abuse or neglect, the possibility of obtaining my permission to release the tapes, and finally, a court order requesting the release of confidential information. I agree to these terms.
I am going through a major life transition, starting a new job in a far away place and leaving my family behind. I have been very close to my niece and nephew and I am worried that I might lose the closeness with them and not get to see them very often.
I feel guilty about moving away from my loved ones to start a new chapter in my life. I initially chose to be close to them, and I think I might have built expectations that I'll always be there for them. But now, I want them to know that I still care and want the best for them.
I don't want people to view my actions as negative. I've tried to make good choices and be a risk-taking role model for my loved ones, especially Alison and Joshua. I think it's important for them to see adventure and risk-taking as something valuable to experience excitement someday.
I've spent a lot of alone time worrying about not having support in my life. I feel like I could have made better career decisions if I had used that time for self-introspection. I often feel miserable and anxious about meeting sales goals in my retail job, which doesn't make me happy.
I haven't really verbalized or thought about what might have been causing me to worry so much about going or be so excited yet so worried at the same time. I was right back in my apartment when we talked about scheduling, thinking about who could go with me.
I used to work in retail with a strange schedule, and it made it hard for me to connect with my peers and really enjoy my time in Grand Rapids. I regret not being more present and worry that I'll bring this fear and mindset to my new job with a different schedule.
I wish I wouldn't have worried so much doing things for myself in the past. It wasted my energy and kept me from doing some things that I probably would have enjoyed.
I'm feeling burdened by the thought of leaving my loved ones, thinking that they might not continue to function without me. It makes me feel like I'm abandoning them, especially the children. My brain says it's a crazy thought, but my heart feels it somehow. I'm worried about their growth and development, and if they will be okay without me.
When I saw my loved ones crying after they had been told about my situation, they wouldn't look at me or touch me. I feel remorse about their loss of me. I thought they needed to be told first, so they would have time to process it. Later, we talked about dog races and my future opportunities, which was helpful for me.
I have been having doubts lately about whether I'm doing the right thing, especially as things get closer to ending. I keep wondering if I'm making a mistake and this goes back to my need to be perfect. It's something I've been thinking about for a couple of weeks, and it came up more prominently when my son got glasses.
It's like, I just realized how judgmental I am about myself.
I like myself, but I don't know why I had to be so perfect. I'm trying to pinpoint when did it start, and I don't know when it just sort of started happening.
As a patient, I express my concern about being judgmental, especially in terms of raising my two boys. I want to make the right decisions and provide them with the right opportunities and consequences. I also mention that I am particularly worried because I am a female raising two boys.
I'm having trouble with relationships, especially with men. I feel like I'm going to be very judgemental.
I know I need to be stronger. I tried staying in the marriage for the kids, but that didn't work. It wasn't good for me because I stopped being a person.
I feel like I'm no good for myself or my kids, especially now that my divorce is getting closer to being final. There's just so much going on in my head, and I don't think I want any quiet time because it only makes things worse.
I feel like I'm not being real with myself whenever I laugh to avoid experiencing the pain, and I know that accepting everything, both good and bad, is important.
I've been trying to avoid certain things, but I've realized that I can't escape them. I have no choice but to deal with them to the best of my ability, and I know that having a good support system is crucial.
I have received support from my friends and family, and it has been helpful for me. However, I still tend to beat myself up over things.
I feel taken for granted and unappreciated, but I realize that I'm the one who started doing everything for others without them asking. It's difficult for me to admit that I might be at fault here.
I never noticed it before, but I guess I tend to use humor to hide my hurt and keep it down. I don't know why I do this, maybe because if I find something humorous, it doesn't feel as painful.
I find that laughing about things helps lessen my pain or troubles a bit. I believe it's easier to laugh than cry about things.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with work and daily tasks, making it difficult for me to rest or relax. I sometimes take breaks to calm down, but it's been a while since I have been able to truly unwind.
I'm struggling with the decision of whether or not to file for divorce. I know it will cause a lot of changes and I'm trying to be strong for my kids. I wouldn't think about it too much if it wasn't for them.
I feel like I need to please people to be liked, and I consider myself selfish if I don't. Even with people I barely know, I still want them to like me.
I don't want you to not like me. I don't even know who you are. But that's there, like being perfect. It's gonna be hard. I've been doing it for 37 years.
I've been putting up with it for a long time now, and I sometimes slip up. But I don't want to beat myself up about it, I just want to learn and grow from it. I'm really determined to make a change.
I've been struggling with being patient with myself, especially when it comes to making significant progress in my personal growth. I know I can't change everything immediately, but I have a hard time accepting that. I believe I will be able to make the changes I want in a few years, though.
I'm recognizing that I am patient, especially with a lot of things about me. For instance, I thought about being patient with the kids or the boys.
I feel like I shouldn't make mistakes, and I don't want my kids to make any mistakes either. I try to cushion every corner to protect them from problems. My mom did the same for me, but I still wanted to test things and make mistakes.
But she was kinda protective, I guess and, and I'm protective too. I was able to do some things but I guess not a lot of things.
Lately, I feel like I have to guess about a lot of things, including my own actions. For instance, I just caught myself biting my lip, and it's something I think I do without realizing it.
I often use certain things as a cover to avoid being caught just standing firmly. It just feels like I need something to hide behind.
I feel like I have to be ready for anything that comes up, so I'm always covering myself. I guess that's all it gives me the chance to say yes or no.
I recently didn't do something I was supposed to do to help someone out, and I confessed this to my close friend of five years. She was really surprised and said she never knew that side of me before.
I recently started a new friendship, and we're still learning about each other. My friend was surprised to hear something about me, and I found myself quickly pointing fingers at myself and finding fault with me. I often do that.
I try to find the good in me, but I also want to find it for someone else. I feel like I'm preparing before someone notices my kids.
Recently, I've been feeling a little bit stupid for feeling this way. I know it's impossible to be perfect, but I still find myself feeling this way and I don't like it.
I understand that humans aren't supposed to be perfect, but there's this logic inside me that makes me want to be perfect even though I know it's not normal.
I'm feeling a bit conflicted about my stubbornness. On one hand, I see it as a good quality because it helps me to stay in charge and eventually, people see things my way. On the other hand, I worry about the possibility of making mistakes while insisting on my point.
I have this constant fear of making a mistake, and it's always there. I don't know why, but I've made mistakes in the past.
I've been through a lot with my mom, and I came out okay. There are some things I wish I didn't do, but I'm still here and doing things. I don't know why it matters so much.
I'm struggling with the fear of making mistakes because it might cost me more time, money, or effort, and I already feel like I'm going in different directions. I guess it's just my personality to like having a lot of things going on, but I'm also worried about making sure I have enough money to take care of everything.
I like being human but I want to be on the other upper end of that, I think.
I haven't managed to break that list yet, and I'm not sure what to do now.
I'm trying to figure out what I want to do now, and the first thing that comes to my mind is that I want to be a better mom. I especially want to continue being close to my family.
I enjoy spending time with my family, which includes my mom, my dad, a sister, two brothers, and a niece.
I want to continue to give in my friendship with my girlfriends because they've done a lot for me. I want to do more for them and be there for them. So that means I've got to get out of this and get my life straight.
I'm considering the possibility of pursuing my Ph.D., but I'm not sure about it. My mom wants me to do it probably more than I want to. I might go for it, but I am not certain.
I struggle with being patient with myself and in my job. I feel like everything needs to be done now and perfectly in my relationships, and I find it hard to walk away and think about something when I don't agree with it right away.
As a patient, I have trouble with needing to convince someone at the moment in a conversation, even if we may never agree. I need to work on being patient and understanding that everyone is entitled to their own thoughts, including myself.
I didn't have a goal, now I do. I didn't think about that. It was pretty good. Yeah, to really put me first, yeah. I like doing that. I really do. I can tackle anything. I mean, I can tackle kids turning in simultaneously late for school, covered up with five million excuses. I can take my kids bickering with. It is a piece of cake.
I have trouble remembering important things, and I think it might be due to some patterns that I've developed over a long time. I know it's going to take some time to break away from these old patterns, but it's frustrating.
I should totally accept who I am, but I know I have my ways that sometimes are not the nicest or sometimes I could be stubborn, and I don't want to give in.
I've been thinking about some things in my life that I wish were different. I realized that I can be really stubborn sometimes, but I don't think that's a bad trait.
I think being stubborn is a good trait, and I like having it.
I do have a routine, but I'm also flexible. I have to be flexible because I have kids.
I often feel the need to be flexible with myself to give myself some leeway in various situations.
I feel like I keep going back to situations so that I don't make mistakes, and I think I do this to maintain control over things.
Sometimes I don't even enjoy being a mom because I take it so seriously. There are times when we probably miss out on fun because of how seriously I approach parenting.
I'm a working mom and I miss my kids while I'm at work. When I come home, instead of sharing light moments, I take charge to ensure their things are organized, and they've started their homework. I do this to lessen their problems in life and keep them organized. I sometimes wish we can take a break from worrying about it for a while.
You know, sometimes I try not to nag, because it reminds me of their father. However, some days are good, and some are bad. But I am beginning to recognize the pattern now.
When I feel tension, I realize that I need to stop and chill for a while. But sometimes, I get caught up in my own agenda and don't pay attention to what's happening around me. Like when I ask my kids about school, they give me typical responses, but later I hear about something that happened in recess or something else...
I am feeling angry about my past relationship, as I was left with a lot of responsibilities that should have been shared between both of us.
I feel there's no problem, but sometimes, past events play back in my mind. I have to take charge of certain situations and consider my own personality. It takes two people to make a relationship and similarly, two to make it fall apart. I think part of the reason why we're not gonna be together anymore is because of me.
I like to fix things and solve problems for other people. I don't know why, it's just sort of my nature. But when there's a problem, I'll just start fixing it, even if it's not my problem.
Sometimes, I shut myself up without even realizing it. Everyone can see it but me, and I don't know why I do it.
I have been struggling lately, but after our recent conversation, I am feeling better and more hopeful about my situation. Thank you for your help and support.
I was raised by my mom and have mixed feelings about how she raised me. Some things I agree with, but others I don't. I think she wanted some flexibility, but she wasn't perfect and never tried to be.
I struggle with the desire to be perfect even though I know it's okay to make mistakes. I tell my kids that it's fine to make mistakes, but I have a hard time accepting it for myself.
I tend to not make many mistakes, but when I do, I'm unsure of how to handle them. I think it's probably because there's more going on behind it. I give my boys more freedom to make mistakes than I do for myself.
I feel a heavy sense of responsibility for my children, and that's why I can't make mistakes. I take their upbringing very seriously, but I feel like there's no love between us this time. I'm worried about how it affects our relationship.
I brought my children into this world and I always said that if I'm going to bring children into the world, I'm the one who's supposed to be responsible for them.
I feel like my family doesn't really help me with my problems, but they're always there to reassure me. I'm the one who puts pressure on myself, and I think I'm more critical of myself than they are.
I'm not sure about something, and it's causing me uncertainty. I think we should self-analyze, but I don't know if it really matters.
I believe that we should admit our mistakes and be critical of ourselves, but not to the point of it being destructive. It shouldn't lead us to depression, or losing our self-esteem, or stop functioning because of it.
I feel that I shouldn't be so critical on myself.
I feel overwhelmed with all my responsibilities at work and home, and I'm having a hard time managing everything. I feel like I'm drowning and don't know how to fix it.
Sometimes, I feel like NYU only wanted me because they were filling some kind of quota, and that makes me doubt my talent and hard work. I didn't have as many doubts when I was acting at Brooklyn College, where I felt like an artist and could focus more on my craft.
I've been feeling more doubtful about my talents and capabilities lately, although I've always had some kind of doubt before. I used to feel accepted and supported by my classmates, but now I don't feel that way anymore.
As a patient, I would like to continue discussing my issues in future sessions, and I appreciate the suggestion.
As a patient, I first came here when I was five. I didn't think too much about my accent back then, but around the time I got into undergrad, I started to become more aware of it.
I've been realizing that the way I speak sounds different from my classmates. I still get notes about it, and it feels like they're pointing out something I didn't realize I had. I spend a lot of time practicing, but sometimes it feels like I can't keep up.
Lately, I've been feeling kind of alienated, like I'm the only one in the room and people are looking at me, thinking maybe I'm not qualified or I don't have the job.
I really love being in theater and I think my undergrad laid a strong foundation for me. Now, I'm getting more hands-on experience and understanding the craft even more. This is my first year and second semester here.
I studied theater at Brooklyn college and it was really fun. My best friend also went to Brooklyn college, and although she wasn't a theater major, we had an apartment together off campus. She came to see all my shows, and it was a really nice community.
I'm Precious from Queens. I grew up in Richmond Hill in a diverse community with West Indian and Latino influences. I spent my elementary and middle school years there. Though I was born in the Philippines, I moved to Queens when I was five years old.
I am the eldest of three siblings. My younger brother Joe, the youngest, just started middle school and he's very driven. I think he wants to be a doctor. My parents are very proud of that. My other brother is in high school right now and he wants to go into computers.
I've been feeling really off-centered lately, and I haven't been sleeping well. This has been going on since the semester started, and it's familiar but has gotten worse recently.
Lately, I've been waking up really tired and as soon as I get up, I have a long to-do list. I go to class, have rehearsal after that, and on weekends, I work at a bar in Brooklyn. I spend a lot of time commuting and I'm working part-time while going to school full-time. I just needed the winter break as a relief.
I have been feeling really exhausted lately, and sometimes I can't sleep due to insomnia. At night, my thoughts are mostly focused on what I have to do the next day and how to fit everything in. For example, if I'm not studying lines, I'm working on a research paper or rehearsing with my scene partner.
I recently moved back in with my parents, and I sometimes feel guilty because they're still working and I feel obligated to help them, but I have a busy and inconsistent schedule. They give me space, yet don't understand my schedule fully.
I feel a great deal of responsibility towards my family, to care for them and support them, but there's a disconnect since they may not fully understand my pursuit of a creative career, like theater. I remember when I was younger, I wanted to try out for a character in Harry Potter, but my dad discouraged me, saying they weren't looking for my type of Asian. I think he just wants me to be successful and do more than just survive.
I believe the person cares for me, from the way they were trying to protect me.
I feel like there is a generational gap between me and my younger siblings, and it's interesting to see how my parents raise them differently than they raised me. I catch my siblings snapping at my parents, but I don't think they mean to be rude or disrespectful. My parents, however, don't seem to understand that.
I feel like there's a difference in how my parents treat me compared to how I treat them. I wouldn't be on my phone while they're talking to me, but they often do that when I'm talking to them. They don't mean to be rude; it's just how they interact with their iPhones.
I was raised to hold a lot of respect for my elders, look people in the eye, and greet them when I enter and leave a room. My brothers, however, don't hold the same values because it's not the culture here. I used to live off campus during my undergrad, but now I have to commute from home, which has made me notice this difference.
I feel intimidated when I perform in my dialect class in front of my classmates and professors. They give me feedback and sometimes my classmates chime in too. I often feel like I don't know what I'm doing there.
I've been feeling like I don't belong, especially in my class at NYU. The racial dynamics are pretty strong, with mostly white people and only one other person of color. When I perform in ethnically Euro dialects, like Irish or English, it feels fake and goes against the core of acting which is supposed to depict the human experience.
I've been feeling like my accent is fake and that I'm trying to put on this accent as a way of embodying someone I'm not. I can't even remember if I had an accent when I moved from the Philippines.
I feel a lot of pressure to prove myself to my family because they don't really understand my choice to pursue a career in the arts. They are very proud of my siblings who are in more scientific and mathematical fields. I want to show them that I can make a living in this field and be successful.
I finally achieved something I've been working towards, but it feels like it's taking a lot out of me, and I'm really stressed right now.
I feel like there is so much pressure to perform well in my environment because I am one of the few people of color there. It feels like I have to be twice as good as everyone else or else, I will be seen as a failure.
I feel worried that people from my community will judge me, and my parents expect me to go into the medical field. My dad is a registered nurse, and my mom works at a department store.
I feel pressured by my traditional parents to become a nurse, even though they give me space. They pray for me to change my field and don't understand my lifestyle. They want me to succeed, but prefer that I have stability.
I am a Filipino American actor studying at NYU, and I feel blessed for the opportunity. However, I'm struggling with a dialect course, as most of my classmates are Anglo European, and the dialects we're learning are predominantly from Europe. It's hard for me, and sometimes I feel like I don't belong there.
I'm struggling in my dialect class because it feels like everyone else knows the material naturally, while I find it difficult to keep up. The other day, we were working on original pronunciation in Shakespeare, but I just couldn't pronounce it and felt like my tongue didn't work that way.
I am struggling to make a decision about my marriage because of my husband's rage issues. He refuses to attend therapy and doesn't acknowledge his behavior. I am not sure if I should stay or leave, and I need guidance.
I feel trapped in my relationship with my husband, similar to how I felt with my dad when I was a child. Even though my husband is a good father and provides for us, I feel like if I keep looking at both sides, I'll never make any decisions and just remain stuck.
I'm concerned about my husband's blood sugar problem. He is borderline diabetic, and we struggle to keep his sugar levels in check. He comes home in a bad mood, and we only have a short time to get him something to eat. This can be quite stressful for us.
I was feeling strong and decisive about leaving my situation, but when I started talking about my partner's difficulties, like his stressful job, long working hours, and poor health, I started feeling apologetic and thinking that maybe I should be fair to him since he doesn't ask a lot from me, besides having meals on schedule.
I'm usually on time with dinner, but my husband still gets upset if it's late, even if it rarely happens. He works construction and has a specific window of time for eating due to his blood sugar issues. However, he doesn't become physically abusive all the time.
As a patient, I am dealing with a difficult situation involving balancing legal, financial, and housing issues, as well as the emotional aspects of the problem. I am having trouble figuring out what to do and wanted to reach out for help.
I'm really confused about whether to stay or leave my current situation, especially because my children love him, but I can't see why. I know someone else whose kids hate their dad and she still wants to go back to him, but that makes no sense to me.
As a patient, I feel that my children desperately want love from their father, but he is not the person they need or want. They have stopped loving him, but I still feel there's some attachment remaining. I think it would be easier if he were mean all the time for us to completely move on. Can you help me understand why it's so difficult for them to let go?
I've been trying to be a better wife, mother, and homemaker, but sometimes I feel guilty and struggle with maintaining it. I think I need to pay more attention to time and be more responsible.
I feel like my husband is under a lot of stress and he tends to get angry and beat me because my performance as a wife and mother isn't good enough. But sometimes, I feel that his reasons for getting angry are not justified, even though I mess up sometimes.
I feel doubtful about the differences between my past and present situations. In the past, like when I was six, I felt trapped and didn't have choices. But now, I chose to come here and I understand I have the option of divorce.
As a child, I was stuck in a situation where I developed a real attachment to my parents, who were also the perpetrators of my trauma. Despite their actions, I formed a connection with them because that is what mammals naturally do. However, in my home, the people who were supposed to be the safest and most important were actually the most dangerous and frightening.
I don't know about talking about all this stuff from my childhood. I thought we're supposed to work on what's going on now, because the problem is now. I just don't know what to do.
I've been working with this amazing girl, Nadia. We have had a good start and she feels comfortable with me. I plan to continue seeing her and have told her about bringing the family together to discuss her issues. As I have a better understanding of the family situation, I'd like to schedule a family session next week and focus on Nadia's feelings. There are many issues to tackle, but I believe with practiced self-care skills, we can help her get back on track.
As a patient, I feel that it's been quite challenging to communicate and get along with certain people in my life. I fear they might leave me if they had someone who could offer a more objective perspective on certain topics. I believe that having a professional like yourself could be helpful in coping with the situation for everyone involved, especially for Nadia, who is very outgoing.
I was conflicted about coming in for a session, and the plan was originally for my wife and I to come together. However, due to an emergency deadline, I couldn't make it, so she came in by herself. I find it impossible to time my schedule properly.
I am a journalist, working as a reporter for a local print media journal. Sometimes, deadlines jump up and cause problems, which is what brought me here to discuss with you.
I have been working for about 15 years now and have built a reputation in the community. My wife and daughter, Nadia, recently talked to you.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed because my two oldest sons are really high achievers in both school and sports activities. But, seeing them so busy after school seems like a good thing to me.
I can't put into words how humiliating it was when I was escorted by armed police officers through the airport terminal. They took me to a room and didn't explain anything. I was so afraid that someone would see me in that situation.
I was supposed to catch a flight and my bags were on it, but they told me my bags have been taken off the flight. I was really scared. I couldn't catch my flight and they left the room. I sat there for a while before someone came in, having horrible thoughts in my mind.
I experienced a situation about six months ago that has caused me emotional distress. It's affecting my personal life, work, and now I'm even too scared to answer the telephone...
Every time the phone or there was a knock on the door and it's not something that I really, really was expecting, honestly, I get anxious and the hair on the back of my neck raises. I get a cold chill.
Lately, I've been really struggling with some feelings and problems I can't seem to control. It's been affecting my family and my wife. I'm sorry that it's been impacting them, but I just don't have any control over it.
As the patient's father, I have noticed she has some issues and could use help from a therapist. Her mother and I are involved in her life. I want to know what the emotional atmosphere in the family is and if continuing to see her would help.
I feel that the home environment is very stressful, and I'm sure a lot of that has to do with me. About six months ago, I was on a business flight to Washington D.C., and since then, things haven't been the same.
I was on a plane and everyone had boarded, but suddenly the plane stopped and pulled back up to the gate. The door opened and a couple of uniformed police officers came in.
Recently, I was on a plane and security personnel got in, looked back at me, and asked me to get off. I had no idea why or where they would be taking me. They escorted me off the airplane and walked me back through the terminal area.
I am the patient's family member, and we want what's best for her. She's a very sweet girl and we don't think she'll have any problems communicating. When the family has to get together for these sessions, I will make sure to be there.
I'm here for the moment and I want what's best for my family. I'll do whatever it takes to make sure that everything is the best. My wife and I are devoted, committed, intelligent, and ambitious. We're going through some stressors, but we're determined to turn our energy back to our family situation.
The lingering effects of a past situation have affected my home, work, and myself emotionally, causing traumatic stress. It has also had a significant impact on Nadia, especially considering her mother's devout Muslim beliefs and her being the only girl in the family.
I've noticed that Nadia hasn't been doing well in school lately, and there has been talk of her having suicidal thoughts. This has shaken her mother, causing her to become more overbearing than before, which is creating more problems for Nadia.
I feel like my daughter Nadia isn't living a normal 15-year-old life. She goes to school and comes back, and she's always under her mother's watchful eye. She doesn't associate with her friends like I think she should.
You know, I always felt judged in my past counseling sessions. People just wanted to know what I did and what I was thinking. But with you, I don't feel that judgment as much, and I'd like to know if I'm not a weirdo.
I've been thinking about myself as a nut all the time, and it feels nice that someone doesn't think I'm crazy.
I don't feel comfortable talking about my past experiences, especially because I feel like what I did isn't as bad as what others did. I feel guilty, ashamed, and frustrated, but I was just a kid back then. I'm not used to talking about this stuff and I don't know if I'm making sense.
It's hard for me to think about my past actions constantly. I feel like I've thought about it enough. I spent eight years in jail, and I can't keep living it over and over, saying that I shouldn't have done that. To briefly describe the incident, I was out with my friends at a house party when things went wrong.
I had to talk to someone about my past experiences because it's mandated as part of my probation. I served eight years in prison and I started when I was 19. Although I understand why I have to do this, it feels like overkill sometimes.
I get home after a long day at work, worried about my job and feeling stressed. I'm concerned about losing my job, and when I get home, I hear about problems with my mother. I feel that my partner should relax a bit and get along with my mother in her kitchen. It has always been her house, and I grew up in that house, which is more than 40 years old.
I have been dealing with the issue of caring for my aging parents. Times are tough, and I didn't want my mother to be in a retirement home. I'm aware of other young couples who will face this issue. I feel like I'm a pioneer in this situation and it's quite challenging.
I feel like I wish we had our own house that was our space. My father was really proud of being the provider for our family, he made sure we had proper housing and I guess I've internalized that expectation as well.
I don't spend private time with my mom, even though we are close. I think I am closest to her among my siblings, but we don't talk much about personal issues like our feelings about my dad. I'm just usually busy.
I've been feeling really overwhelmed and experiencing painful emotions. I try to avoid them, but they just seem to get worse. I guess holding them in is making it worse. What would be the worst thing that could happen if I allow myself to feel these emotions?
I'm feeling sad about my relationship with my mother, and I think it's related to my dad's passing. I haven't been able to open up and talk with her about it.
I feel like I wouldn't be surprised if something happened, and I think she would feel the same way too.
Since my dad passed away, my family is not really discussing much about it. His name comes up in passing, but it's usually my mother who mentions him like, 'Do you remember when dad planted that tree?' That's the sort of thing she would say.
I feel a lot of sadness and I miss my father. It's still a very painful subject for me and my mom.
I was close to my friend. We didn't talk much, but I used to help him with projects around the house and gardening. We had a bond, and I miss that close feeling.
I feel like there's a lot of pain in my relationship with my mom, and it's hard for us to talk about certain things. We don't really spend time together, especially alone. It's always either with the kids or other family members around.
I get an idea for a painting or drawing, but I don't start it because I want it to be perfect and I get scared. If I start and see a flaw within the first five minutes, I stop immediately.
I think the idea of satisficing, engaging in something I enjoy without focusing on the outcome, would be challenging for me. But, I would like to give it a try and not worry about what it's going to look like. People do critique my work, and that might make it difficult. However, I find that once I get involved in creating art, it feels meditative and fun.
I enjoy being creative and feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish creating something I feel good about. However, I struggle with the initial push to get started, even though it's fun once I actually begin.
I've been feeling blocked in creating art lately, which is causing me anxiety and depression. In the past, I would just get started and be able to create, but now I wake up feeling more anxious and fatigued. This has been preventing me from getting up and creating art, and I've started having negative thoughts about myself and my future in the art world, worrying about money and success.
Lately, I've been feeling down and I'm scared that it is affecting my productivity. I'm also feeling more tired than usual and seem to have lost my creative spark.
I remember feeling this way at one time in my life a few years back, and it was kinda short term and I was able to get through it somehow. But for more recently, it's been maybe the last couple of months that I've been feeling this way.
I feel good when I'm doing it, but I find it easy to let it slip sometimes, even though I know one session isn't enough.
I do enjoy the process and I'm trying to create reminder cards to help maintain a positive mindset. But I'm not sure how often I should read them or if I should only use them when I'm feeling bad.
I've been working with my counsellor on building up a specific muscle, and they asked me how I feel about it. I told them that it sounds good to me.
I noticed my anxiety level drops significantly when I'm creating more art. I feel better overall, and my mood is lifted.
I've been struggling with getting started on my drawing or painting projects. I find it helpful once I'm involved in the process, but I have a hard time starting.
I tend to overthink and judge my own decisions, which sometimes causes me to stop before I even start something new, like picking up a hobby. I worry about making mistakes and how that will affect my progress.
I sometimes feel like giving up on a process that I actually enjoy because of negative thoughts that hold me back. However, I think reminding myself of the positive aspects and how much I gain from it could help counter these negative thoughts.
I'm not sure about pursuing a Ph.D. because it's a big commitment, and I feel like others might think my disability could hinder my success. I'm wondering if it's the right choice, and I feel like my counselor might be doubting my abilities too.
My wife and I haven't had many problems in our relationship, but things have changed recently. I'm not sure if we're doing the right things or not. I've been having trouble sleeping, staying awake at night, thinking about whether or not our decisions are right, and if I can ask certain things of her.
I guess I wonder if, when I'm trying to make joint decisions with my wife, I get concerned that I have to deal with issues regarding my own career choices and integrating that with my disability. I'm sometimes worried that my wife might try to meet my needs because of my disability.
I've been feeling conflicted since our last session. I want to go to graduate school and pursue my Ph.D., but my wife has a career here and is working on her master's degree as well. I don't want her to give up everything to follow me to another place for my studies. I'm not sure how I'd handle the demands of a doctoral program and whether I should feel guilty for asking her to accompany me.
I have been struggling with putting my needs first, and I want to pursue a Ph.D. in rehabilitation psychology.
I have a master's degree in vocational rehabilitation, and I would like to continue on with that. I've looked into all the factors involved in pursuing a Ph.D., and I believe I'm ready to do that, despite it being a big step and requiring a lot of work.
I don't think my partner and I have ever actually talked about gender issues in our relationship. I think we mostly follow traditional gender roles, but if I see something that doesn't feel right, I try to address it and make sure my partner is comfortable. I'm not sure if she's good at doing the same though.
I'm worried that my partner, Lisa, might be silencing her own needs in order to prioritize mine. Sometimes, I'm not aware of it happening and it's bothering me because I don't want her to feel like she has to suppress her own desires.
I'm struggling because I'm not sure if my partner is okay with a decision I made. She says it's fine, but I want to know if it's genuinely okay with her.
I don't think my partner feels sorry for me or is pitying me because of my condition. Our relationship has progressed far beyond that point, and I was already in a wheelchair when we met. I trust her motives and we have never had issues with this topic.
I was in an accident, and now I use a wheelchair to get around. I worry that my wife might be staying with me out of pity, and I don't like that. I think I might be making incorrect assumptions about her, but I also wonder if she's not being assertive about her own needs.
I feel like my partner may be putting her own needs secondary, possibly due to cultural or gender expectations. I'm not sure if that's the case, but I try to encourage her to express herself and tell me how she really feels. I want her to know that it's okay to let me know if she doesn't want to do something, so we can explore other options.
I have some really great friends, but I feel badly that I was unable to appreciate that a lot of times. I've struggled with confidence issues, doubts, and experiences that have affected my relationships and jobs. However, in the workforce, people began to see me as a leader and looked to me for guidance, which was interesting and unexpected.
I never saw myself as someone who could be a leader. I always felt like I was following too much and, I think that was pretty important for me to realize that, you know, people do, I was trying to see that people really did see some good qualities in me.
I had a really negative encounter when I first arrived at work, but I just told myself to forget it and went off to do my job. It was a pretty good day overall, aside from some negativity and rudeness from people at the restaurant.
I have a decent job, but I sometimes find myself getting caught up in all the negativity and difficult situations. I try to remind myself of the good things about my job, and I remember a specific instance in college that helps me with that.
I was hanging out with some friends one day when I suddenly felt a wave of uneasiness and had to leave the room. After that day, I've been telling myself that I don't want to feel like this anymore, but I don't know what caused it.
I recently found myself singing a song about a...
As a patient, I feel that sometimes I need to remind myself of the good things and focus on the positive aspects of life, instead of dwelling on the negative. I am a waiter and my job is quite stressful, making it difficult for me to enjoy being there and appreciate that I have work.
I get caught up in the negativity of others and it affects me a lot. I don't like it, and I want to approach situations where I can find and focus on the positive things.
I walked into work on Friday after not being there for a couple of weeks. Immediately, one of my co-workers made a negative comment about customers. This negativity affected me, and I told myself that it's going to be tough working with rude people and getting bad tips.
I've been struggling with self-esteem issues, and it started when I was young. My parents were always supportive, but I wanted approval from my peers. I never felt like I fit in and, at times, felt scapegoated.
I've been treated meanly and rejected in the past, which has affected me. I don't always feel like it was my fault, but I've never really felt like I fit in. I tried playing football because I love it, but I'm not a jock and I still struggle to find my place.
I used to try to be friends with people who I didn't really connect with because I wanted to be popular. I would hang out with the popular kids, and I think I missed out on the friends that I actually liked. I wasn't appreciative of what I had, and I don't know what drove me to feel that way.
I'm not quite sure if I'm okay with who I am, but I believe that if I am, I will eventually find the niche that I'm supposed to be in.
I feel like my thoughts become more tangible and workable when they're outside of my head. I have a little more power over them, and I can better sense how true or powerful they are when they're not inside me.
I've been feeling overwhelmed by my thoughts lately, and when I keep them inside, they seem to have a lot of power over me. However, once I speak about them, I realize that they're not as big of a deal as I originally thought.
It's not that big of a deal, and it kind of makes it less powerful to be able to speak about that. It was definitely interesting to hear someone else speak about me in relation to them.
I realized that my issues are not solely mine and that other people are also going through the same self-doubts, negative thoughts, and problems. It's interesting to know that this is normal.
Lately, I've been struggling with issues of confidence that have been a recurring theme throughout my life. Sometimes I feel very confident and sure of myself, but other times, I find myself being very tough on myself and feeling like I'm not good enough, particularly in general life situations and relationships.
As a patient, I would like to talk about my issues with confidence. There are times when my confidence seems to disappear, and during those times, I find myself being really tough on myself.
Sometimes I don't feel good enough. I don't know what that's good enough for, but sometimes I don't see what other people see in me. A lot of people say that I'm a good person, intelligent, and hardworking, but sometimes I don't get it, you know?
I have been feeling a lot better lately.
I think the person who would believe in me the most and believe that I would have the ability to offer something really worthwhile and make a difference in the world is my father.
I have a friend who has been really supportive, encouraging me, and reminding me of good things when I have negative thoughts. We have great conversations about this, but I'm not sure what he would say when negative thoughts threaten to rob me of my confidence.
I can't seem to find immediate relief from conversations with my friend when I'm not feeling great. We talk about life and he encourages me, but I only recall those conversations and thoughts later on. It takes a bit of time for me to process and make use of the encouragement.
I had a conversation with a friend and it just ended with me saying 'Right,' and agreeing with them. I feel a bit unsure about the conversation and how it went.
I feel like I'll be in a good place and then all of a sudden it's like something inside me is trying to bring me back down. It feels strange to me.
Lately, I've been having negative thoughts all of a sudden and I don't know what's causing them. It's strange because I have this conversation with myself, questioning why I'm thinking this way. I just want it to stop.
I don't get it. I don't know why these negative thoughts just creep in there, and I try to stop them. I want to enjoy my life, be okay with who I am, but it's like these thoughts just creep in out of nowhere, you know?
I love that people think I'm doing a good job and I appreciate their feedback, but until I can believe it myself, it doesn't really matter what they say. My professors, parents, and friends believe in me, but I'm struggling to take it onboard for myself.
I feel pretty comfortable with this filming of a conversation. I think it's important, but I'm also aware of the camera.
I feel a bit uneasy with the camera being here during our conversation, and I'm going to try my best to be comfortable with it. However, I'm aware that it might affect the conversation in some way.
I was in a conversation where the counsellor asked if I could let them know if they were discussing something I wasn't comfortable with, and they assured they wouldn't want to trap me into speaking about something I didn't want to. I appreciated their effort to respect my right to choose what to include in the conversation.
I felt good having a connection with someone and it was nice to be reminded of it. It pushes the doubts away, at least for a moment, and gives me a bit of a high.
I try to hang on to positive moments and remind myself of them, but sometimes negative thoughts and doubts consume me.
I feel very comfortable talking to you. I feel like I've gotten a lot out and learned a lot from this conversation. It feels good to be able to express thoughts that had bounced around in my head.
I often lived too much in my head and I'm not able to express myself. But recently, I started expressing my thoughts and it feels good to be able to do that.
Lately, I have been feeling better about my self-esteem after putting in a lot of effort to remind myself to be more positive and accept my good qualities.
As a patient, I had an experience with a client who seemed very similar to me. We both went through some similar things, questioned our lives, and thought about who we were. I was able to use my personal ideas and experiences to help him.
I believe that my own experiences helped me make a connection with him, and I am almost positive that it made a difference for him. We had similar experiences, and I could see the connection between my own journey and his.
Well, experiences like that remind me of why I do what I do, and why I'm doing what I'm doing, you know. It's reminding me that I do have things to offer and that I can be helpful.
I feel good when I help people. I feel good and I feel good, uhm, when I can make a difference and, uhm, I feel good when people come to me, uhm, with, with some issue and, are seeking help from me... that feels good to me. Uhm, I just, I feel like I accomplished something.
I feel like people value me, and it makes a difference when they do.
I've always been in the field of social services, but I've been hearing doubts from my professors, parents, and friends. I haven't done anything else, and I don't have any desire to do anything else, but these doubts make me wonder if there's something else I should be doing.
As a patient, I feel like my problem-solving mind is always charging back in and doubting my decisions. I haven't tried other solutions, so my mind asks how would I really know if I made the right choice.
I'm in school to be a therapist and I get a lot of positive feedback about my abilities. Although I'm doing well in school and believe in myself most of the time, there are moments when I doubt if I'm in the right place and have a hard time believing in my capabilities.
I'm struggling with feeling like I'm in the right place and doing good for others, particularly during difficult times. Last semester, I had some personal issues and did a lot of soul searching, trying to figure out if this path is right for me. I did well in school, but it's not about academics, it's about whether this is the right path I want to take.
Last semester was very difficult for me, and I have a hard time accepting that I don't know what the future holds. I struggle to live in the moment and be comfortable with where I am right now.
Lately, I've been dealing with a lack of confidence and it doesn't seem to have a specific trigger. It just happens about once a month where everything starts to bother me and I feel low.
I struggle to identify how my negative emotions happen, and I try to figure it out, but I don't get it. I don't feel good, and I don't know if trying to figure it out makes a huge difference. I've just learned to deal with it over time.
Sometimes, I feel low and struggle to find motivation to do anything. After a few days, I eventually feel better, but I don't always have the energy to do things that might help me feel better.
I have a hard time following through on things. I think grad school is pretty important to me, but I struggle to follow through on my interest and value in doing various tasks.
I feel like I'm doing very well in school. It's different because in college, I wasn't overly interested in the academic part. But now, I'm more responsible and trying to figure out what I want to do. I'm taking a more significant interest in my current field, and I'm doing very well. However, I still have doubts if this is where I belong.
I don't want to have doubts about my future, but I don't know what it holds for me or what my mission is.
I had a conversation with my counsellor, Dr. John Winslade. He asked me about the voices I hear in my mind, like the one of negativity or doubts. I didn't really know what to call the other voice, but I guess it's positivity.
I'm not quite certain about what to call my situation, but I think it's related to confidence and maybe encouragement. I've noticed that in the last five years, these feelings of positivity, confidence, and knowing where I belong have been growing stronger.
I am very new at my current job and I don't feel overly confident in my work. I am worried about my performance and it's making me feel stressed.
I've been trying to remind myself that the future is unexpected and I need to be okay with that. I think what Gerald said just reinforced the idea of living in the moment and cutting myself a break. I like listening to people who have gone through similar things as me.
I have been listening to others and learning from their experiences. Recently, I heard Gerald talk about the importance of being patient. He mentioned that he wishes he had the clarity or sense of things as I do right now, which made me feel good. It also made me think that maybe I'm doing better than I thought.
I feel like my negative thoughts are feeding on each other and it's robbing me of the sense of beauty in life.
As a patient, I've been trying to be more positive and remind myself in repetition to see the beauty in life. I've noticed quite a difference in my sense of self and who I am in those moments. However, I'm not sure how this new perspective actually changes things for me and how it works.
I think repetition is positive, and there are things that I like to do and have fun with, but I find that I'm not doing enough of them. There are other things that make me feel good that I'm not really doing, like exercise and playing sports, but it's difficult at this point in my life to do all the things I want.
I have concerns about money, time, and things like that, but I also have ideas about personal growth and feeling more positive about myself. I believe that exercise is connected to this growth and improvement in some way.
I've had these voices in my head for as long as I can remember, telling me that I'm not good enough or popular enough. These feelings began in grade school, when I didn't feel very liked or popular.
When I was younger, I always tried to be nice to others, but kids can be really mean. I was often the scapegoat for mean comments and actions. It wasn't until college that I started to feel more confident in myself and began a journey of self-improvement. Today, I feel much more confident than ever before.
I'm struggling to let go of the difficult memories from my childhood. It's hard to move on when I remember the hard times during grade school and high school when I was treated badly by other kids.
I felt like I wasn't good enough after the situation happened.
I realized that I have more power over my reactions to things and can handle negativity better. I hope that it would help raise my confidence and make me feel better about myself.
It has been a difficult journey, but I feel like we've reached a good place to take a break. I appreciate your help and support throughout this process.
I'm in a relationship right now that I feel pretty good about. However, I definitely have doubts. As of today, I feel good about it, but two days ago, it would have been a different story. I go through this back and forth a lot. The doubt is somewhat powerful, but I feel like I've done a lot of thinking and work to undermine its effects.
I am still struggling with a problem, although it's not as powerful as before. I think it was more prevalent about five years ago, but it became better after college. However, it's still there, and I don't like it.
I have made some progress in coping with my doubts, but I still struggle with overthinking. Although it can be helpful at times, I find that overthinking often becomes problematic for me.
I've been experiencing constant doubts and overthinking that come back even after I've dismissed them.
I've been struggling with self-doubt lately, especially in my career. I am trying to be a good employee and a leader, but there's always this voice inside me that undermines my confidence and makes me question my abilities. I'm also experiencing some uncertainty in my personal relationships, and I think it might be related.
I feel uncertain about where things are going, and this uncertainty brings about a voice of doubt in my mind, making me believe that I'm not good enough. I want to be sure about things, but I know that it's an unrealistic goal.
I'm struggling with uncertainty about my future and self-confidence in my leadership abilities, even though I am being seen as a leader. I don't feel as strong as I want or like I have the right to lead and tell people what to do.
I've been feeling like my emotions have been fluctuating a lot recently, and I think it varies from being 80% in control to 50% or even 100% sometimes.
I have been struggling with working too hard, and I need to find a balance. Today, I had a conversation with a counsellor and another person named Gerald. I keep telling myself that I need to cut myself some slack and be more patient. As I move forward, I want to make my life closer to my goal of 80/20 work-life balance.
I feel overwhelmed when I go back to the restaurant and I think it would be helpful if I could cut myself some slack. I'm not sure if it's the right situation, but I might be trying to reach a perfect state of mind, which could be leading to perfectionism.
I don't know. I think, I guess that's one place and I think there's probably other places but, uhm... It will just mean having a better day at work. Not allowing the negativity of others to kind of bring me down.
I've been trying to stay positive, but my brain takes me to places where I start thinking about the future and suddenly negative thoughts come in. I don't really know where these thoughts come from, but they interfere with my more hopeful thoughts about my future and raise uncomfortable questions.
I have doubts about who I am as a person. Sometimes, I don't feel like I'm as good as others say I am, and I'm struggling to give myself credit and allow myself some space to not always be perfect.
I've been struggling to see myself as a good person, but at the same time, I'm trying to give myself some credit and focus on my positive qualities. I'm working on finding something that's worthwhile and that I want to do in my life.
Ever since I heard that Monty Python song, 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,' I started using it to help myself stay positive. Whenever I am feeling bad about something, I sing the song to remind myself to find the good qualities or the positives in life and not get caught up in negativity.
I've been trying to be more positive, and when I do, it makes a huge difference in my life. I start to notice positive things and not be wrapped up in the negativity of life, which can be pretty negative with a lot of bad things out there.
I find myself getting overwhelmed by all the negativity and hatred in the world, and I end up missing the beauty that's also around. I want to find a balance in recognizing both the negativity and positivity in life. I'm not sure if there's a connection between the negativity and the feelings of depth, but I want to understand it better.
I think my feelings of doubt have pushed me toward seeing things in a negative light.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with all the worries I had last semester and haven't been able to process them. When I feel them in my heart, it's not the same as dealing with logical issues.
I have been relieved from some of the burdens I was facing. But lately, I've been worried about my marriage. I want to be a better husband and partner. We've faced some hurdles, and at one point, I started lying about little things. I also get wired up on caffeine, so I try not to drink it.
I was trying to study at night for classes two semesters ago, but I ended up drinking caffeine, watching TV, and lying to my wife about it. I was also working a lot and not spending much time with her. The situation escalated during dinner when she caught me lying about the ingredients in a dish, which led her to question if I was lying about other things, such as cheating on her.
You know, I told them about a month before, and I'd known for about five months that this is what I wanted to do. I wasn't open to any other suggestions. They suggested having a small wedding some place, but I already made up my mind and that's what I did.
I was kind of close-minded after whatever happened, and now I just want things to be better right away. I think that's why I may be quiet because I don't want to be a part of any arguments and just want all of it to go away. I don't want to have argumentative tones anymore.
I just don't like it. I've had scenarios like that where it's been rewarding to do that.
I've procrastinated for a while, and I know from some experience that taking action is the best course. I'm just struggling to get started on it.
As a patient, I find it difficult to enjoy compliments because they often feel underhanded to me. I've been trying really hard to fit in throughout my life, but these compliments just seem to have other tones and make it more challenging.
I grew up with my parents who were supportive to an extent but even when I did my best, I never felt fully appreciated. I tend to get frustrated with both my mother and my father.
I laughed when you asked that question because it caught me off guard. There are parts of my past that I find difficult to forgive, and I've been avoiding addressing them. To cope, I often use sleep or other distractions like drinking to make the pain temporarily go away.
I've been feeling the need to share something with someone, and I used to go to my partner's therapist with them at Madison, but I haven't met their current therapist yet.
I have been married for a little over a year and a half. The bickering between my spouse and me has been present for even longer than our marriage. I sometimes feel like it would have been better if I wasn't in the situation.
I was in a hurry to get here today. My partner goes through these phases where she talks to various people like friends, sponsors, or therapists to feel normal. I'm not sure where I stand on that continuum, but I think I'm doing alright.
I recently received a lot of good news and I was riding high, feeling fairly well. However, I still think there are aspects of my life I could improve.
I guess I have dealt with my issue a little bit, but it's not normal for me. I find that it has to be like our session where it's in the forefront and fresh, because without practicing it, the progress just kind of goes away.
I've been feeling really angry lately and I'm not sure how to cope. Also, I won't be seeing my wife Beth until tomorrow morning.
Last night, I had an argument with my partner in the car. It really hurt me, but I've been hoping that by tomorrow morning, the issue would have just gone away on its own.
I'm feeling frustrated because I hope that my partner's mood and my feelings would just go away, but they don't. I keep thinking they will, but they never do. It's like I'm one of her students being reprimanded and chastised for being too loud. She knows she does that to me.
Lately, I've been feeling like my anger just builds up inside me and doesn't dissipate, and then eventually I have these rage explosions.
Lately, my relationship with my wife has been fairly intense. Today, I felt like anything I said wasn't acceptable to her and she seemed annoyed with me. It was quite unnerving.
I am usually loud and intense, but my wife is not like this. She is a teacher and has intense days, so she sometimes asks me to tone it down a bit. But today, she was more argumentative than usual and wanted to get into an argument, which I didn't want. It actually helped our relationship.
I just was keeping quiet and, in the act of keeping quiet, I was missing questions and stuff like that. My partner would ask me some questions and I wouldn't answer which would irritate her, making the situation fairly irritable today. After that, I even went to her therapist today.
I've struggled with my confidence and self-esteem for a long time, and people around me are quick to point out what I'm doing wrong, but they don't appreciate the effort I put in. I've been working on this and it's becoming less difficult for me.
I've recently had a conversation with my counsellor. We talked about some patterns in my life that I've heard from a few people, and maybe I shouldn't dismiss it as repetition. I'm trying to overcome the legacy my dad has handed to me and the denial I've experienced. What do you think?
Hi, I am the patient and I just had a brief introduction with my counsellor and expressed my gratitude for the meeting. We exchanged pleasantries, and I told them that it's nice to meet them.
I'd consider going to therapy, but I don't think my dad would ever consider it. It's probably too threatening for him. My parents went to a therapist once, but then my mom went back without my dad because he wouldn't go. I'm not sure what they talked about.
I've been grappling with my issues lately and trying to break free from the denial that has plagued my life, like my dad. However, I often beat myself up and feel criticized even when others aren't around. I've been working on this, though I feel I haven't been totally successful.
I have a situation where I need to call someone tonight, but I'm struggling with the idea. However, I assure you that I am being honest with myself and it doesn't sound too difficult to me.
I am feeling better than I have in the past, and I am striving for improvements. However, I don't know if I'm trying to bite off more than I can chew, but it's got to be better than last semester, which was very hectic.
Last semester, I had a lot of worries, but things have been better this semester as I got into the classes I needed. Financial aid was a mess last semester due to a new computer system, but I applied for some scholarships and found out recently that I got two of them. However, I don't know how much I will receive yet.
I'm struggling with the pressures of my job, school, and feeling like my wife isn't where she wants us to be in life. I can't seem to make her happy, and it's causing me to constantly walk on eggshells and not be myself around her.
Lately, I've been trying to focus more on my meetings and prayer. I used to pray in the morning and evening, which helped me a lot. However, I've just started getting back into the habit before the conference, which was a good motivator. Despite making some progress, I know I'm still not doing as well as I could be.
I've started school and everything is going smoothly. I'm keeping up with my readings, which is good because I usually fall behind. I recently got a job, and the hours and wages help with our income. Last semester, I was worried about income, got depressed, and was out of work. Instead of doing homework, I would just be a vegetable. Now that has changed, and I find that I'm best off when I'm doing something.
I've noticed that having a schedule or pattern helps me. I currently work Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and go to school on Tuesday and Thursday. I also have a class tonight. So far, everything seems to be going well, and I feel like I'm starting off on the right foot.
I used to channel my anger through sports like hockey and football. However, I sometimes feel like I shouldn't be angry or that if I was dealing with life on a daily basis, my anger might not build up.
I'm having trouble being honest and open in my relationships because I'm afraid of being rejected or punished. I end up walking on eggshells and avoiding conflict, which makes my relationships feel artificial and less intimate.
I'm worried that if I allow myself to feel anger, I will act out that anger towards others. I don't think I can express that anger in a controlled way.
I feel like I'm in a difficult position because when I'm around people I care about, I never have the opportunity to be myself. I'm constantly compromising to fit other people's expectations and trying to avoid disapproval and criticism. However, this tactic only leads to the very thing I'm trying to avoid, like when the person found out about the milk.
I've got these powerful strong messages about how I'm just a screw-up, and I am very sensitive to it. I'm constantly scanning my universe, anticipating it, and working very hard to avoid it. I'm sure it's a torturous way to live my life. If I allowed myself to feel more, I would probably feel anger at first.
I used to hold on to my anger and play physical sports to get a kick out of a good hit or something like that.
I feel like I need to take on more responsibilities to avoid upsetting my wife, such as going to the store, going to the bank, and cleaning the house. We do a good job at splitting tasks, but sometimes I don't feel comfortable asking her to do certain things, like going to the bank after work.
I didn't want to say something because I thought it might upset her, and she might put me down like she has before. It makes me feel bad, and I think it stems from my experiences growing up in my home and with my peers.
I can't see it much, but my family members have pointed out that I wasn't validated a lot or if I was, it was in weird ways. For example, I'm getting good grades now at college, and my mom would compliment me by saying she always knew I had it in me. But it feels like she's asking, 'Why weren't you getting these grades all along?'
I attended the World Conventions in San Diego for my honeymoon. It was a cool experience and I still think it is pretty cool.
Ever since I got married in Vegas, my relationship with my parents has been strained. I've tried to make amends by expressing regret for the timing of when I told them and for hanging up on my sister, but we still kind of dance around the issue. I don't know what more I can do to resolve it.
I thought my mom would be the hard one to deal with, but she eventually became more accepting. However, I didn't expect my dad to react the way he did. It hit him the hardest because I'm his only son and the youngest child.
I recently tried to open up to my father about my feelings and how I was scared to tell him things. I even brought my wife and family together to have a conversation with him, but it seems like he still struggles with communication.
I feel financially and emotionally down because I feel like I let my family and myself down. My wife and I got married in Las Vegas without inviting our parents, and when we told them, my parents didn't take it too well. I think a lot of hostility around that decision hasn't been worked through.
I got married in Vegas and didn't invite my parents because I didn't really want them there. I didn't know how to tell them, and now I think my decision to get married without them has created a lot of hostility.
I'm not sure, but I believe that a relationship should be a spiritual union between two people without any negative energy or feelings. I don't want it to be tainted by people getting drunk or any other negative behaviors. When we were in Las Vegas, we didn't experience any of that.
Recently, my partner and I planned a trip during which we stopped in Vegas for a couple of days and got married. We had a good time there, attended a few shows and then continued our journey towards San Diego.
I wanted to share that I recently attended the 65th anniversary of Alcoholics Anonymous.
I lied to someone, and it took a long time to rebuild the trust in our relationship. I don't understand why I lied in the first place.
I think I have been lying about certain things, like drinking caffeine, and I didn't want to share that with anyone.
I lied because I wanted my partner to think she was getting her way, but I also wanted to get what I wanted. For example, I put milk in my coffee because I like it, but she doesn't like it at all.
I tried to take a shortcut while cooking by not dirtying another pan. I thought I could get away with lying to my partner about it.
This week was difficult for me. I found myself wanting to call David and talk to him. I was crying a lot and dealing with the urge to reach out to him was tough as I don't want to fall back into an emotionally abusive relationship. I've been distracting myself with TV and staying busy, but it's still been hard to deal with the loneliness.
I have this pattern of jumping into new relationships quickly after a breakup. My counsellor suggested joining a meetup group for socialization. I think it could be a good distraction, but I'm not sure if it will help me feel the same way as having a boyfriend would.
Lately, I've been feeling quite stuck and I think it's time for a change in my life. I am willing to try something new to improve my situation.
I have a history of getting into relationships that look very similar, and I tend to get distant from my friends when I'm in a relationship. I think being balanced in life is important, but I have a tendency to get very close to someone and ignore my friends, not making time for them, which leads to an imbalance.
I think having connections with other people is important for my well-being. So, I guess I could try to contact some friends that I haven't spoken to in a long time. I don't know how they'll receive me, but maybe if I explain that I'm making a lot of changes in my life, they'll be willing to pick up where we left off. I think it would relieve some of the anxiety I'm feeling right now.
I've been feeling guilty about my partner's behavior and how he treats me. But now I'm realizing that it's not my fault. He tries to blame me or something else for his actions. When I'm upset, my first reaction is to run away. I've struggled with this problem for a very long time.
When I was 17, I had already graduated from high school and was working downtown at the stock exchange. I had responsibilities and moved out on my own, but I was also taking care of my sick sister, which was challenging.
I wanted a life of my own, so I left my husband. I have lots of skills and shifted in my life, but I feel like I'm not as successful as I want to be. I have a baby, but I have no worries about harming my baby.
I'm a very strong person, but I think that a lot of our problems have to do with the fact that both my partner and I are strong-headed. I have never considered harming myself because I have to live for my son, and I'm the only one who can take care of him.
I was prepared to stay at a place that wasn't my house, but it was quiet and comfortable with my dad who has been sober for a long time. It was safe for me and my son, and I could do my work. I learned a bit about living with an addict and realized I can't force my husband to go to therapy.
I attended a support group meeting because my father is going through treatment, but sometimes he doesn't want to go back to the therapist. I want to keep going to the support group for my own well-being. During my pregnancy, I struggled with sleep when he didn’t come home.
I have been worried about my partner who I believe is staying out late and not answering my calls. When I called him last night, he didn't have his pager or cell phone with him. I didn't even know he was gone until I woke up this morning. I don't cry as much anymore; instead, I feel anger and sadness because I know the problem is not with me.
I am worried about my husband's drinking problem, but he doesn't admit that he has a problem. My dad comes over to our house frequently, about two or three times a month. He enjoys spending time with us and our son.
I'm worried about my father, who is around 46-47 years old. He's been in and out of AA, and he just moved back in with my mother about three years ago. She never really expected much from him, and she managed everything by herself. He's working now, and I believe we can rely on him.
I recently left my husband and stayed at my father's house for a month. It was comfortable, and I enjoyed the time there. However, going back to my mother's house is difficult as it is crowded with family members and tenants. I feel like I didn't have a childhood.
I had to take care of my sister, who is 12 years younger than me.
I'm worried that the fighting will continue in front of my child.
Today, I felt really upset because my partner was pushing my buttons. He said things that were so hurtful that I had to sit in my car for 15 minutes before I could even drive away from the house.
I'm struggling with my partner's behavior when he doesn't come home, and we pretend like nothing happened. I've tried to just accept it, but I think that only makes things worse. I really don't know what to do.
I've tried being loving and giving him a hug, but it doesn't work. He just wants to do what he wants to do, and I think it's because he has a problem. He's intoxicated when he comes home, and it feels like I'm just playing the same lecture to him.
I've tried to run away within the home and deal with the issues in my marriage. I can't live with it, but I know if my husband wasn't there, I'd find somebody else. We have our pluses like love, our child, a lovely home, and a strong sense of family, but we face negative issues like drugs, time, money, and growing up.
My husband has been unemployed, and it's affecting him negatively. He spends a lot of time sitting around the house, and I've suggested that he could use this time to learn new skills or work on projects around our home. However, he's been stuck in the same routine for over a year.
Recently, I decided that I won't leave my family again. I have realized that there's still enough caring in our relationship. I want to stay and be present in my child's life.
I just don’t want to waste another five years, you know... I'm very confused and I don’t know what to do. The most important thing I've learned from my relationship with my husband is not to tell people things that happened in my past that have no concern with what I am today. I guess when dealing with him, I've learned to become an even stronger person.
I've been struggling with how my loved one has changed due to alcohol and drugs. It feels like he's not the person I fell in love with anymore.
I have been waiting since January for my second knee surgery. There are some issues with the Brookman's camp, and I have a lawyer dealing with them. Meanwhile, I cannot continue my therapy for my right knee because of my left knee. They won't let me go back until the other knee is fixed.
My partner seems to be having trouble managing his job and finances. He can't do his job without certain things being done, and he gets paid from a specific camp. We don't have separate bank accounts, but I think he is spending more than he should.
I don't control my husband's money, but as far as I know, we spent all of our tax refund on our son's medical bills from his birth.
I know that the incident was an accident, and the hospital bills were for that.
I have been attending couples counseling with my husband and we were given exercises to do, but we haven't been really engaging with them. I've left home twice since my baby was born six months ago, and I am suspicious of my husband disappearing for whole nights. I suspect he might be drinking and doing drugs, like cocaine, but I have no evidence.
I'm the patient's partner, and he’s been off work for a year now due to a workplace injury. He had surgery on his right knee and is waiting for surgery on his left knee. Meanwhile, I'm healthy with no major issues, except for a C-section surgery.
Since I got pregnant, my husband and I don't sleep in the same bed anymore. He has started sleeping on the couch, and I sleep upstairs. This has become our new normal.
I have been facing issues in my relationship since the day I got pregnant, which is over a year now. My partner doesn't talk to me about it and always comes up with an excuse like we don't have a cable upstairs, and he needs to sleep with the TV on. However, we never had such issues before.
I haven't been doing very well after childbirth. The delivery was horrible. I had to be induced early because my baby was very large, and I ended up having to have a C-section after laboring for over twenty-two hours. My partner wasn't there to support me during my recovery.
I had my baby on Wednesday and came home on Friday. My husband went out on Saturday and didn't return until Sunday night. I was upset and went to my mother's house. My mother stayed with me that night. My husband did this type of thing throughout my whole pregnancy, so I just ignored it, but it was hard with a new baby.
You know I mean I… it's my house too, I wanted to go home. So basically that's what happens is when he does things like that I want to go home and so I just deal with that because there is no other option.
I've been dealing with a lot of conflicting emotions about my husband. He didn't come home, and I didn't care at that point. I've tried writing him letters to tell him how I feel, but he rips them up without even reading them. He has an addictive behavior, and it's causing me misery. He's managed to make me feel like I'm the one who's crazy and needs help, which has led me to doubt myself.
I love him so much but I'm struggling because I can see his weaknesses and his positives. I think if he goes back to work, he will go back to normal and stop sleeping all day.
I'm feeling really overwhelmed and confused right now. I thought everything was going according to plan, but something unexpected happened and now I don't know what to do.
I am Jennifer and I struggle with this issue where I keep doing the same thing over and over again without any success. It's really hard for me and I've tried trying to change, but I have difficulty staying quiet and not doing anything.
When I'm hurt or mad, it's hard for me to keep things inside. I feel like I have to let it out and let my partner know how bad they have hurt me. But even though it feels better to express my feelings, it doesn't really work to resolve the issue.
I had an argument with my spouse this morning, and our child was upstairs. He's very smart and even though he's young, I think he knows what's going on.
Recently my son has been throwing up in the car, I think it's because he knows I'm upset. He's with me all the time when I'm not at work, and he goes everywhere I go.
I used to drink occasionally, but I never considered myself an alcoholic. In fact, I haven't drunk since I got pregnant. Maybe I just noticed my partner's drinking habits more now. I was going to school and working, so maybe I didn't notice as much before, but he has never stayed out all night.
I don't want to leave my partner even though I know it's for the best, because I love them and don't want to give up everything that I have with them.
I have a beautiful house and three dogs. My son needs a father and I love my partner, but he decided not to continue counseling with me. He didn't come home until 9 o'clock this morning and I think he might have been drinking. I don't believe everything he says. I talked to his father today and my partner thinks I betrayed him and can't trust me.
I recently had a conversation where I was talking to my boyfriend's dad.
Things have become difficult between my husband and me since the birth of our child. We never argued before but didn't discuss our problems either. We bought a house together, which was a big commitment, and now we're talking about divorce. He's a great father when it suits him, but I don't know if he's discussed the divorce with his family.
I am married to a man who is close to his parents but tries to hide everything from them. He doesn't want them to know anything about our problems, although they know we're going to marriage counseling. I have talked to his father a few times about his behavior, hoping that he or someone else in the family can influence him and make him realize that his actions are not normal.
I am dating a guy who is a year older than me, making him 27 years old. He finished high school and went to Louis University. He is kind of immature, but he has a decent job now.
I'm not sure if I want to reconnect with an old friend because I may have pushed him away and hurt his feelings. I think the main reason for our disconnection was my involvement in the church, but I never really discussed him with anyone there. I'm torn about rekindling the friendship.
I'm worried about bringing my friend to a social event because I think people will say he's a bad influence on me. I feel like I have to choose between my friend and these events because I don't think they fit well together.
I feel like I'm being forced to pick between two important things in my life. Currently, I don't see any other alternatives.
I feel like my issue isn't a significant problem anymore because I have Philip, who I can talk to and who understands me. We're similar in some ways and can connect well, which helps me express my thoughts and emotions with ease.
I've been feeling better since our last session, and it seems like my friends have noticed the positive changes in me too.
I've been trying to figure out what makes me happy because I was tired of feeling depressed all the time. I just want to focus on myself and my thoughts and desires. My mother, who was the one concerned and started me with therapy, has noticed some changes and thinks that the counselor must be working.
Ever since I started attending therapy, I've become happier and less depressed, and it's not just an act. People around me have been noticing the positive change in my life, especially my mother, but she thinks it's only because of the counsellor.
I don't have a lot of friends, but the ones I have, I'm not pushing away anymore. I guess I'm more socially connected now. However, my differences and individuality still come up and I just try to ignore it.
Lately, I find myself reacting to situations passively instead of actively addressing them. For example, if someone tries to push me off, I just go with it and don't put up much of a fight.
Lately, I have been feeling sad and depressed, but there's nothing specific causing it. Recently, I stopped talking to my close friend Philip, and I don't really talk to my other friends anymore. They don't understand me and often pressure me about things like going to prom or dating, which I don't think is for me.
I feel really frustrated because my friends keep bringing up a certain topic that I disagree with, and they don't seem to understand that it's not for everyone. I had a friend, Philip, who understood my viewpoint, but we don't talk much anymore.
I've been struggling since my relationship with Philip didn't work out. We met at the grocery store where I work, and I just can't seem to move on from this.
I'm here because my mom made me come. She's been worried about me because I've been depressed lately, and she thinks something is wrong. I guess I've been a little more sad than I normally am.
I've always been sad and depressed, but lately, I don't want to hide it anymore. I just don't care if people see it or not. I guess I don't want to be bothered and just want to be alone or sleep the day away. I've stopped socializing with my few friends and have been keeping to myself.
I've been withholding my feelings for a long time, but I'm running out of mental energy to keep them hidden. It takes too much energy to act like I'm happy when I'm not.
I recently joined Jehovah's Witness, but I wasn't raised in it. It adds stress to me because my family is not involved, and they belong to a different faith. My involvement in my church has led me to view my friendship with Philip differently.
I don't feel like my family is very supportive of my choices, they're kind of indifferent. But my church is really important to me, they are supportive and make me feel good about myself. I can talk to them about certain problems, but I don't think they'd understand everything.
When I feel sad, I can usually go to people at my church for support, but some issues make me feel uncomfortable talking to them because they just wouldn't understand. There's a saying like 'birds of a feather flock together' that seems relevant here.
Lately, I've been struggling with breaking some of my bad habits, and it's starting to affect my daily life. I find it difficult to focus on anything, and these habits are ruining some of my useful habits as well.
I feel guilty for pushing my friend Philip away, even though he was a positive influence in my life. We recently reconnected and I've been able to talk to him a little bit about my feelings and why I pushed him away. He understood my actions and is very forgiving.
Today, I'm a four on the sadness scale. Some days it's six or seven, but most days it's a five. I've reconnected with Philip and I'm wondering how this is impacting my relationship with my church.
I kind of doubt my regular activities and I don't go as often as I used to. I feel guilty about it and I am still uneasy about finding balance in my life.
I've been struggling a bit lately, but I've started making some of my own decisions and embracing my individuality, like we've discussed before.
I guess, I mean, I'm a little nervous since it's the first time meeting you, but I feel a little better, just, I guess, talking about it.
I've been feeling better lately, so I decided to call my friend Phillip because not being his friend anymore didn't feel good. We're friends again, and it feels good now.
I was surprised that my friend was open to being friends again after I pushed him away. We're friends again and he hasn't held it against me, so I feel good about that.
I'm struggling internally because I have a close friend, Philip, who I believe is a good person and understands me. However, my church might consider him a bad association because he's not involved in everything. I like him a lot, but I fear this might be dangerous for me. When I'm around him, I feel like my thoughts aren't right, so I decided to stop talking to him, even if it hurts his feelings.
I am feeling very depressed and hopeless about my situation. I can't really talk to people at church about it, and I've tried to push the problem away, but I still feel bad about it.
I'm emerging from a lifestyle that I've been in and I'm trying to hold on to what I feel is my core. There's all this new stuff coming in and it's like a form of assault, but exciting. I'm trying to find the balance between that feeling of assault and being very attracted to the water, and wanting to be there, wanting to stay on the beach.
I am discovering how much of a right-brain, spatial and holistic thinker I am. It's difficult for me to think linearly, going from point A to point B without considering F, H, and Z. I am enjoying the discipline and challenge of trying to be more logical and linear, but it's also an assault on everything I've done and the way I pick pieces out of midair.
I have been worrying about whether things fit right now. In my dream, my youngest brother was assaulting me, but actually, it was my second oldest brother. We had a fair amount of competition in our family.
I don't know what to think about that relationship. We've been out of touch pretty much for 13 years.
As a patient, I noticed that my eye contact became more direct and I had to look down and right to stay in touch with my feelings and block off any feelings of attack. I also found some support in doing so.
I found some support within myself, and it feels good when I embrace it. It's something I can use, like a body posture.
I have been working on some specific behavior changes, but I still feel like there are many different ways I could go about addressing my issues.
I've received a postcard from someone and I'm considering writing them back. However, I think I'd wait until they write to me again. I'm not going to hurry with this decision just yet.
I feel that my parents were not as aware of what was going on with me because I had to deal with less attention and became strong and tough. They saw me as the one who could take care of myself, and they didn't realize that I had as many social problems as I did. They were very confused when later on, I moved to the mountains and joined a spiritual group.
I've been isolating myself from people for a long time, but recently I've started to realize that I'm competitive.
I have this image of my life being a book, and I'm trying to connect the different chapters of my life - my experiences as a child, my relationship with my siblings, and the significant moments that have shaped me. But I'm not quite sure how these parts fit together.
Well, interestingly enough, the way I see this is that there are three distinct phases of my personal development, certainly, the brother-sister family development, then the social development with my peers in school, and then, even though I skipped to the spiritual part, there's some there, too.
I have this book at home that I really value but I may never read it. I like to say that I get what's inside it through osmosis rather than actually reading it. For me, it's like the book is there and on an unconscious level, I know what's in it.
I have a precious journal that means a lot to me. It's like the core of me, but I may not ever read it. Sometimes, I feel annoyed when I think about it.
I was feeling very protective of my book and a little annoyed that everything was happening so fast, and I wasn't able to protect my book as much as I wanted to.
I have this feeling of wanting to hold something up, not to hide it from others, but just so that it isn't tainted or damaged.
Lately, I've been feeling extremely uncomfortable with wetness or dirt around me, and it's affecting my daily life.
I am feeling a beginning sense of synthesis and I recall Viktor Frankl's idea about finding new meaning in old situations. I am not comfortable with intense emotions like tears and laughter being demonstrated.
I have old childhood incidents which I've used parallel techniques on myself. As an American, it's highly individualistic culture, I put it all on my own shoulders. Lately, I feel more comfortable with myself.
As far as the painful situation in dealing with groups goes, I do look at it in terms of, I have that sense of, well, given that situation, I still did these things which were positive and showed my strength. It's still preliminary, but I feel a little more faith in my own strength.
I'm trying to focus on what's beneficial for me and using the set of tools I have at the time.
As a patient, I recently came across the hand technique which seems to be a blend of dereflection and Gestalt therapy. I am curious about how this approach works and whether it could be beneficial for me.
I remember being at the beach with my brother and a friend. As everyone started leaving, I tried to put on my shoes and gather my things, but everything started moving in slow motion. I was being very deliberate with my actions. Suddenly, I felt a wave of cold.
Today, I was at the beach and water hit my feet, touching the edge of my book. I picked up all my things and moved up the beach, but just as I started to put my things down, the water came washing in, going over my legs and up the beach. I felt annoyed that I couldn't get myself together fast enough.
I had a dream about water coming in very fast. I tried to look for an exit to escape the rushing water. The water was blue with foam and fast waves, but they weren't tidal waves. It was like long waves that came up a long, flat beach. I was with my friends Pat and Charles before the waves started coming in.
In my dream, I was at a beach with a dark green emergency and a wave coming up, hitting a book. My friends were there, but then they disappeared. My brother was also there, and when we were asked to leave, he left, but I don't know how.
I felt angry when a guy in my class was teasing me and erased my work. It bothered me even more that the teacher just sat there and let him do it. I feel like that situation wasn't fair to me.
I feel upset about a situation that happened in class where a person was laughed at for a long time and driven out of the room. I don't think it's right or fair to let this happen and I believe it could have been avoided.
I feel nervous and strange about saying what's right and what's wrong because I am uncomfortable with laying down a line and defining them. This feeling is making me question myself.
Ever since my classes started, I've had a difficult time participating in large group discussions. This has made me feel bad about myself because I haven't experienced everything possible in class and shared my thoughts.
I've been feeling more relaxed lately, especially since preparing for our sessions. I'm able to put distractions like the television out of my mind.
I had a dream that I was on a beach, and I'd like to understand it a little bit better. Do you want me to just tell you what the dream was and its sequence?
I recently had a dream where I was on a very wide beach with pure white sand and a beautiful aqua blue ocean full of waves. However, I couldn't hear the sound of the waves. There was a large, dark, pine forest about a hundred yards away and it was a nice, sunny, warm day. I was there with a woman.
I had a dream where my friend Pat, my brother Charles, and I were having a picnic on the beach. There were others further down the beach. As we were setting up, I saw two dark army green colored emergency vehicles in the distance, like army or police. Their loudspeaker announced to leave the beach as soon as possible with urgency in their voice, but they didn't say why.
I imagine one of my hands feeling lifeless, representing the negative feelings I have been experiencing. While the other hand feels lighter and more flexible, representing the third grader in me who had the sense to leave a difficult situation.
I feel like I'm holding a tennis ball or egg and there's still a lot of stiffness in my right arm. Although I'm holding a little bit on my wrist of my left, it's kind of like my left is blending or molding to the form of my right. My right side seems to dominate in terms of pain and discomfort.
I feel like the feelings of strength allow me to work with my difficulties. It's not that these feelings outweigh the problems completely, but I believe they can find a way to work together somehow.
Although my hand doesn't feel as heavy as it did before, I still feel stiffness in some areas and I'm holding it really stiffly.
It's difficult for me to focus on the positive aspects of that experience. To me, I see it as negative, but I hold on to it because if it's strong in a negative way, it must have some positive aspects too.
I have been dealing with a tough situation lately. I had an encounter with someone and even though it was really difficult, I didn't lash out at him. I didn't hit him or bite him. I tried another way of handling the situation, but it didn't work either.
I'm willing to try other alternatives when something doesn't work. However, I struggled as a third grader when I had to present in front of the class and the teacher didn't provide support. Everyone laughed at me, and it felt terrible.
As a patient, I feel that leaving the situation might not be a positive move, but I had no tools or ways to deal with the situation, especially since I was only a third grader at that time.
I recently experienced three days of intense pain in my gums, but it stopped after that, and I haven't ground my teeth in my sleep since then.
As a third grader, I felt left out and experienced some negative feelings.
When I was in third grade, it was a difficult time for me. We had just moved back from California, and I had some issues during my third and fourth grade years. My third-grade teacher was nice, but there was a lot of teasing in the class, and I began to develop an unpopular status.
I remember feeling really unpopular when I was in the third grade. To make matters worse, I experienced a lot of teasing from my classmates.
I have been struggling with these two issues that are very much there in my life. I also had a dream about the blaring out from army vehicles, evacuating the beach, and a big wave. I am not sure what to focus on.
I feel drawn to the wave, but I'm not sure if I should focus on that or something that feels clearer, like the book and my shoes. I want to explore the connection between the wave and these objects.
I was trying to put my shoes on to get off the beach, but it was taking me such a long, long time to get off and move.
I felt like there was no reason for putting on the shoes, but I had to do it because it was the order that needed to be followed. It was a sense of obligation and duty.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed by a sense of 'shouldness.' It feels like everything in my life is about obligation, duty, and what I should be doing.
I have been feeling angry about a book getting damaged, and it seems like it pushed a button inside me. It's like little rocks are rubbing against each other, and it's creating a kind of jar to my thoughts.
I recently had a dream, and I remember feeling a strong emotion connected to it. When we discussed my early life experiences, I noticed that some of the same words I used to describe my dream were also used to describe these experiences. It was an unconscious connection for me, and I find it very intriguing.
I've been analyzing a dream I had, but it feels incomplete, especially when I think about these rocks rattling around inside me. I believe that it's connected to my unresolved anger issues.
I used to grind my teeth in my sleep. I was in a sensory awareness workshop with Charlotte Silver in Mexico about four years ago, and we did a number of exercises around paying attention to the face.
When I was in third grade, kids used to tease me mercilessly because I was a fat little kid. They used to call me 'Bartender', and it made me feel awful. I felt totally alone, and it seemed so unfair.
I've been feeling really negative and have a hard time speaking up. Sometimes, I don't see the good in myself, and I wonder why I couldn't manage things better when I was a kid.
As a patient, I can say that I still have feelings towards a certain situation. Back in grade three, I had some positive experiences, like having the strength to leave a painful situation, and being patient with people like Peter, the clown.
I did ask him to stop. I remember that. Right, but I, and I did get angry with him, but I didn't carry the anger with him as much as with the authority, ah...
I sometimes feel like I'm expected to solve all my problems right away. I feel like counseling is often focused on the negative aspects, and people forget that I have my own strengths and got through many difficult situations.
I happen to like Viktor Frankl a lot. I think it's a very important theory. However, there's an incident that I've been struggling with which happens fairly regularly. I have this patience and strength, but sometimes it ends up with me not feeling so good about myself and not taking a strong position as I might.
I've been struggling with people making demands on me, beyond what I feel I'm able to give. There's this student I know from a workshop over the summer, and we worked very closely together.
I recognize that my nurturing side is important, but I am struggling to establish a balance and avoid being drained by others. I have done some work on psychic healing, focusing on the concept of making myself a picture that can't be emptied.
As a patient, I feel that while I have plenty of energy to give to others, I am limited by time and space. I struggle to decide which situations are important for me to invest my energy in and which ones are not.
I recently talked about my issues with nurturance and feeling emotionally unfulfilled. However, we then returned to discussion of assertion training.
I felt uncomfortable during our last session, but I also felt like I was taking care of myself and respecting my own needs.
I've noticed that you often reflect my feelings, paraphrase my words, and repeat certain phrases I say. It helps me understand and expand my own image and experiences. I want to know if there's a specific technique you've used that has been particularly helpful or took the wrong track?
I'm very resistant to free association as it feels threatening to me. However, you gave me enough time to really do that and I tried to tie those thoughts together.
I noticed that during our conversation, you mirrored my non-verbals, which made me think of a non-verbal message being conveyed like in a sign language. I'm not sure about its meaning, but it brought out a certain emotion in me.
I'd say the meaning I haven't been able to put into words is positive, but if I consciously thought about it, I could think about some threatening things that this movement might mean. But in terms of just getting the mirroring back, it's positive.
I recently received some information that has been difficult for me to process. However, I am trying to look at it as good rather than bad, but I'm not sure if the information is positive or negative.
I am the patient, and during our conversation about analyzing a dream, I mentioned that you brought up the army vehicles, which pushed a button for me. However, I feel like it's difficult and I'm processing through it a lot faster than I thought it would be.
I think I want to focus more on the book because the wave analogy is clear to me. I just realized that the army vehicles might be related to authority and the shouldness aspect of the situation.
I'm trying to synthesize two elements using the psychodynamic approach. I have some sense of the wave and I'll let that go, but I'd like to look at the book now.
As I recall my feelings with the book, I feel a sense of connection to the characters and the story, but there's also a bit of uneasiness as I try to process the emotions it brings up.
As a patient, I find it easier to work on here and now issues because they are more contextual and easier to tune into. I also find it simpler to translate these issues into the present when I am out of the session.
I remember having certain thoughts and feelings in the third grade that are still coming back to me now. I think talking about them might've made using reflection more useful for my situation.
I have one other comment to make. I remember you told me to just let go of the blocks and not to block what's going on. This really encouraged and supported me.
I've been struggling to let go of certain things in my life, but recently, I received an affirmation or acknowledgement that really helped me. I found it very helpful and liked the technique.
As the patient, I just wanted to express my gratitude for our counseling session.
I remember an afternoon during recess in the third grade. There was a group of girls that I really wanted to play with, but I always seemed to be on the outside. I couldn't quite gain entry into their circle. They would always play kickball and there were times when they would tease me a lot.
I remember feeling like an outsider when I was younger. I had to fight for my right to be included in activities and even resorted to biting someone when they tried to take a ball from me. I still feel like I'm on the outside.
I felt very excluded from social groups, especially in the third grade. This feeling of being on the outside has stayed with me for a long time. When I try to describe these feelings, the most accurate words I can come up with are 'churning' and feeling like I'm 'missing out' on what others are doing.
I feel like I will continue to have a lot going on behind the scenes and attract to me what's mine.
I recently started assertion training and surprisingly, I have found it to be a source of thoughts and insights more than I thought it would be. Additionally, I often take a key something from a dream and draw it, just letting it develop.
I like to create drawings and then put them up in my bedroom. I look at them quite often and find it interesting how they connect with my consciousness. It's intriguing to see the combination of tangible drawings and intangible dreams.
I find myself struggling with connecting to my emotions during discussions because I tend to get caught up in my thoughts and focus more on auditory and visual cues.
I had an experience in the third grade that still affects me, but sharing it here might be out of context.
I've been trying to work through some issues, but it's only gotten more confusing and scary. I spent a whole week with my chest feeling tight, and I couldn't eat.
I could hardly work, and it was really unpleasant. I felt tightness in my chest and threatened, like I had this fantasy that it might be like a big tightening of your heart just before a heart attack or something. I really felt attacked.
When I experienced an attack in the past, I have typically tried to work it out by being honest about my feelings and giving feedback to the person involved. I would also state my ground rules and try to let the other person adjust to that.
As a 32-year old, I feel like I'm still using some of the same skills I learned back in third grade. Lately, I've been thinking maybe it's time to cut off those old habits and develop new ones.
I have a goal that I've been struggling with, and it's making me feel uncomfortable, but I'd rather cut it off than work through it.
I had this dream where there was a book that seemed to carry some personal wisdom. It was a longish book and it had leather corners that were tooled, and kind of a light off-white center. But it was causing me some sort of annoyance.
I recently had a dream or memory about a book or journal, and I'm not sure if I was going to write in it or if I was reading it. I think it might have been something I was reading about myself. I felt very attached to this book and wanted to take care of it.
I have been experiencing different feelings lately. Like, with the book I feel attached and annoyed when the waves got it. With the shoes comes the shouldness of the order. And, with the wave, I feel excitement, stimulation, and aliveness.
I had a dream and it's hard for me to understand. In my dream, there were elements of shouldness, aliveness, and a sense of myself or possession. I'm not sure what it means.
I feel like my partner is trying to possess me, and I don't want to be possessed. It's hard for me, but I don't see any point in talking about it. I don't think anything will be resolved.
I feel terrible and I still feel like I'm putting up a protection barrier so that I can't be hurt anymore.
Lately, I feel like I'm blocking my emotions and cutting off the feelings I might have in order to stay focused on what I want to do. I find myself cutting off feelings of wanting to take care of and be there for someone.
I try to be straightforward in our sessions. I have my own positions and beliefs, and I express them without judgment. I think it's important for me to be honest about where I stand.
I've noticed that I've been cutting off my nurturing feelings, and I'm not sure how to feel about that.
I think I have this issue where I feel like a terrible person because of my past and present actions. I really want to get rid of that feeling immediately. I tend to use drinking and drugs to forget my problems and have a good time, especially when I'm around people whose problems seem worse than mine.
I've been using alcohol and drugs to cope with stress and pain, but it's getting expensive and harder to find as I get older. People are becoming less willing to sell to me, maybe because they think I'm a cop.
I always find myself seeking new drug friends because I get tired of the old ones who start pulling shenanigans and skimming off the top. However, I feel like giving in to this behavior might make me feel even more depressed.
I am married and lead a different lifestyle than I did years ago. Even when I face personality conflicts and mess up, our marriage remains strong and devoted. I am really happy to have found my spouse. We have known each other for about seven or eight years, and we just got married in February.
I'm in a healthy relationship now, but I find myself getting mad at her kids and instigating arguments. I know it's going to cause issues, but there's a sense of exhilaration and feeling that it's the right thing to do in order to gain the upper hand.
I often find myself criticizing others to temporarily feel better about myself, but it never really changes me. How do you feel later having criticized them?
I enjoyed the high and it made me forget who I am. My father was a diabetic and never stopped drinking, even though it may have killed him. I sometimes think my lack of motivation to quit may be influenced by him. It's hard to understand his reasons for continuing to drink despite knowing its harm.
I sometimes have a problem with drugs. I usually take mild ones, but if a hallucinogenic comes my way, I take it as well. However, it sometimes makes me eat even more.
Lately, I've been struggling with drug use and it's causing some issues in my life. When I'm under the influence, I tend to get grouchy and even when I'm just craving a mild substance like marijuana, I become irritated.
I'm struggling with my dependency on marijuana and it affects my mood. I tend to get grouchy and act badly, especially when it's mixed with alcohol. I'm not sure what my main goal should be right now.
I'd love to be a nondependent. It's a monkey I don't need anymore. I'm getting too old for it. It's too congested.
I feel self-conscious when speaking in front of people, and I tend to overthink. I believe I have to do better and be approved by others because it is nice to have friends to share ideas with, and it's not enjoyable to be alone or talk to people who don't have much to contribute.
I have been struggling with feelings about my parents, particularly with how they treated me growing up. My mother is Jewish, and my father used to call me a 'Jew bastard.' I think back on how they both didn't have much education and it bothers me. But I'm back in college now and trying to make a better life for myself.
I've noticed that some totally introverted people suddenly become open and almost crazy when they drink alcohol. I think this was the case with my father, but he never talked about it. It was very painful to watch him struggle with his introversion and other health issues like gangrene in his foot due to diabetes.
I knew someone who suffered from multiple health problems because of his alcohol consumption. He had to undergo several surgeries, but he never gave up drinking. He couldn't stick to his diet, and it seems like suffering from his disturbances was even harder for him.
I've always been self-conscious about my looks and felt overweight, even when I was thinner. I've also been shy, just like my father. Getting stoned helps me come out of my shell and engage in social interactions.
I just want to thank you for talking with me today about my issues. I hope you can help me work on them.
Sometimes, I get tired of being too happy and, and, and looking through the rose colored glass. I come to the real me which deep down inside I was raised thinking that I'm a MacArthur and MacArthur's are no good. This is what my aunts and my mother's family said.
I'm struggling with drinking and drugs, and it's been taking over my life. It feels too hard to resist and try to change, so I just give in to my urges. I know it's not good for me, but it's just easier to keep doing what I'm doing.
I have been struggling with self-doubt and it's affecting my life. Although addressing it seems difficult in the short run, I am open to suggestions and willing to put in some effort to work on it.
I've been struggling with my emotions lately. Whenever things are going well, I feel great, but when they're not, I put myself down a lot. I've also been dealing with substance use, and my counselor believes that my main problem is my self-downing thoughts and low frustration tolerance.
I feel like I take things personally and deserve the consequences because I didn't try harder to keep things going. I would like to be able to say I'm fallible and accept myself despite my mistakes, but I think I deserve this because I've screwed up and used alcohol and drugs.
I've been a bad son and have not stayed in contact with my dad who died in '83. I try to hang out with better people to make up for my rotten past and to build a distance between me and my parents.
I feel embarrassed about my past and I try to get away from my parents. It helps me forget certain things about when I was a kid. I feel like I need to have good friends in order to cope.
I sometimes feel embarrassed, ashamed, and humiliated about my past. I have tried to tell myself that it's fine, that I wish I had a better past, but I always just drift back to feeling embarrassed.
I have been struggling with self-damnation and turning to alcohol to cope. I know it's not good for me, but the temporary relief it provides makes it hard to resist. I used to find solace in reading, which helped me in the past. What can I do to change my thought process and stop relying on alcohol?
I've been reading a lot lately, especially from great dramatists like O'Neill and writers like Kurt Vonnegut. Their works helped me realize that I'm not the only messed up person in the world.
I've been struggling to accept myself despite being able to accept others like O'Neill and Vonnegut. It's just really hard for me to distinguish between accepting myself and accepting what I do.
I know that this relationship is not really making me happy or helping me grow, I've been unhappy in this relationship for two years. I'm just going with the flow, not doing anything to change it. I can't see myself staying in it for another year, but I don't know what to do.
I think I'm just so comfortable with how things are now. I've been doing this for two years, and it's just comfortable to keep doing this. It's scary to think about actually leaving the relationship, not just talking about it.
I feel like there are parts of me that are ready to leave, but there are also parts of me that are really not ready to leave.
I feel stuck in a situation and I don't really want to get out of it. But I also feel guilty when I come here every week and say that nothing has changed.
I think I need to talk about my relationship more and whether I'm ready for the next step. The thought of life after this relationship feels really scary to me, and I'd like to understand my reluctance and fears.
I'm feeling quite stressed today, and I don't know how to deal with it. I've tried various methods, but none of them seem to work. Any suggestions on how to cope with this stress?
Since my separation with my partner, I've been trying to work on my communication skills. Recently, I've started talking to other people openly and casually without making it a fuss, and my boys have noticed this positive change in me.
I was having a conversation with my kids about people approaching me. I told them I guess people might be lonely and want to talk, and mentioned a man I've been friends with. I reassured my kids that he's not trying to be their father and we're just friends. They acknowledged it and were okay with it, but I was worried before.
I think my partner is good with our children, and I believe he will handle their adolescence well. However, I want to acknowledge that we are both still growing and evolving as individuals.
I have just found myself again and have a new way of looking at myself. I like it and I am constantly evolving. I'm changing daily, sometimes weekly, and I've got some growing up to do. Sometimes I don't think the children feel comfortable with him, because I know I didn't feel comfortable with him on some things. That could cause some problems where they don't feel comfortable talking to him about things.
I have a great relationship with my partner. We communicate very openly, and I'm really happy about that.
Last time, I talked about how I tend to put a cloud over things and not see reality, especially when it comes to my relationship with him. I appreciate you reminding me to be safe, as I sometimes like to escape from reality and need to remember that he won't change.
I feel scared about the situation, but I am also glad that it will take some time and will not be immediate. I really appreciate you reminding me of that since it does help me to cope better.
I was never abused myself, but I have been working with abused women for the past 25 years. I'm curious if there seems to be the same pattern all the time with abuse?
I have been reading a book called 'The Battered Woman' by Lenore, and I wanted to talk about it. It has many different variations and can be quite informative.
I recently discovered a book that was published in 1979 by Harper and Row. I think people are still reading it because the issue addressed in the book is still prevalent today. I'm sure they even have it at the shelter.
I'm not sure where I fit in with others, and I wonder if there's a reason we allow ourselves to feel this way?
I'm struggling with my ex-partner's inconsistency in picking up our children. My children ask if I'm mad because of my facial expression. In the past, I used to react more physically and didn't take the time to stop and think before responding to such situations.
I have realized that I often react impulsively to situations, but I'm trying to change that. Now, I try to reevaluate the issue, put things in perspective, and approach it calmly and intelligently. Sometimes I do still react without thinking, but I'm getting better at catching myself and taking time to think before responding.
I used to think that I didn't get depressed, but eventually, I realized that I do experience depression, just not very often. To cope with it, I engage myself in a lot of activities to keep depression at bay.
I don't like depression, but I've learned that it's good. I do go through those days where I'm depressed, and not just because of my period. It's just days where, you know, I'm depressed. And I go through it. I don't try to fix it. I just go through the end of the day.
I've been feeling like I should be happy all the time, but recently I've realized that sometimes it's okay to not feel bubbly and that life isn't always going to be a bowl of cherries.
I have started a new life and I recently got a job that I really enjoy. It's exciting for me.
I was able to get through a lot and even though I know there will be bad moments, I'm not as scared as I used to be. It may sound weird, but I'm kind of looking forward to facing those challenging moments so I can deal with them.
I know that there's another side to it. It's not the end of the world, and I can continue and learn from it. I am allowing myself to date and have new friends, but at the same time, I am maintaining my personal boundaries.
I recently started setting boundaries and creating personal space for myself. It has been quite helpful and I'm wondering why I didn't do this before.
I have a good feeling that it's actually good for everybody, including my boys. I am aware that they're at high risk for using abuse in their own relationships.
I feel like I really need some help, but I don't know where to start.
I prefer to not have any commitment or attachments in my relationships right now. I just want to be friends and enjoy each other's company without any seriousness. So far, I've been able to do that with the guys I meet, but one of them is showing opposition to this idea.
I have been dating African American men, and my husband as well as this guy that I'm currently talking with seem to be more demanding of commitment and my time. I'm not sure if this is a common trait among the men I've been with.
I'm open to seeing if there are differences in people. I know that I've talked to different people when I've gone out to clubs or restaurants. I remember this one Saturday, when a group of us were waiting to be seated, and a white guy started talking to me. I just started talking back, because I'll talk to anybody - dogs, cats, anyone. It's just who I am.
I've recently started doing things that I used to do before I got into a relationship. In many ways, I'm sort of busting out and rediscovering my freedom and independence.
I am a very physical person and I touch people naturally as a way of communication. However, sometimes it gets misunderstood and escalates into a more physical situation.
I do believe he did not have to go the way he went with his response. I know that.
I've realized now that I don't have to confront him anymore, because that's when he gets aggressive. I can now protect myself from him and it won't happen again. But, how can I handle all this during the separation and pending divorce?
My girlfriends have been warning me about my partner possibly being abusive, but as far as I know, he hasn't shown any signs. I've been keeping an eye on it and so far everything seems to be okay.
Recently, my ex-husband got a job as a basketball coach at the college level. He used to not work, but now he is. Our sons play basketball too.
I have had therapy before, so I'm familiar with talking back and forth about what's going on in my life. I'd like to talk about some things that have been going well and some things that have not been so good.
I am Gina, and I am here to talk and share my thoughts with you. It sounds good to me. I can definitely talk, so that'll be okay. (laughs)
Lately, I've been feeling stressed and overwhelmed with my daily life. I'm not sure how to handle it all. Can you help me?
I have two sons, one is twelve years old and in seventh grade, and the other is eight years old. My younger son is quite good at playing basketball.
I am so happy that my son made it to the seventh grade basketball team. I am truly proud of him. He has been passionate about basketball since he was two years old, and now he got the chance to represent his school.
There would be times my girlfriends would say, 'Come on and go out,' and he'd looked sad, and 'Ohh,' and I'd go, 'Oh, that's okay, I'm gonna stay home.' And then I would stay home. And I shouldn't have done that. I should've gone out because there's nothing wrong with me going out. It didn't threaten our relationship any, but I think it did for him. I'd know he wasn't secure about some things.
I never did anything to make my spouse think otherwise, and when I go out with my friends, I feel like a better person. I believe I am a better wife when I come back because I had a chance to be myself. However, my spouse doesn't like that and doesn't want me to be myself.
As a patient, I have been having difficulties in my relationship with my partner. It has reached a point where I feel battered, especially after the last incident that occurred between us.
I realized that I was a battered woman, and the next day I called the police, but I never filed out a report.
I have called before but never filed an official report. The worst incident that happened was probably this last one.
I'm not sure which one was worse, but one time I got slapped in the face and it really affected me.
Hi, I am Gina, and I don't know much about you, but I am here to talk and share my concerns. I've been told that you are a psychologist named Lenore Walker from Denver, Colorado.
I haven't asked any questions yet, but the counsellor mentioned that they will be talking about some personal stuff and told me to ask anything if I have any questions related to their education or anything else.
I've been feeling overwhelmed lately and I need some help. Can you tell me about your area of expertise?
I'm in my pro-woman stage now, and I think we will get along well.
I have been in therapy for a while, and I have done this before.
Sometimes, I get this rosy picture that everything will be fine. But then I quickly think, was it really? It's something I will definitely keep in mind. I feel like Ideny and minimize everything from having been abused.
I know how bad things can get with my ex-husband. There's this man I'm dating, and he might want to come to a game where my ex will also be present. Part of me wants to have him there, even though I know it might cause problems with my ex. But I ask myself, why should I avoid it? Why can't he come? I am the one who is mature in this situation.
I've been going through a situation and it's not that big of a deal. Maybe, as time goes on, it will become easier. But now I know it's too new and too soon.
I don't want to aggravate the situation, so I'll be the mature person in this and it's fine. I know I'm feisty and have a spirited side.
I am feeling better and more in control of my life, but I think it's going to create problems with the guys I date because I refuse to let go. When I tell them about my concerns, they just say 'Don't worry, it'll be okay. I understand.'
I am very proud of my sister who is a teacher. My siblings are not teachers, but my youngest brother is getting the hang of it because he's working with my dad in the printing department, and he's also been helping teach some of the classes.
I didn't start out in the career I'm in now, but I am very happy with where I am. Teaching gives me everything I want - a career, the satisfaction of helping people, and a sense of being respected.
I see my children's father once a week and every other weekend. I haven't made any new women friends since my divorce, and I still have the same friends I had during my marriage.
I didn't let myself get too isolated, but since working at the high school and the junior high before that, I haven't developed any new female friends.
I was very proud of my son for his performance. He carried it off perfectly and he did the ad-libbing with the singing and arm movements. I'm going to encourage him to maybe do acting classes if he gets involved with the park district's programs. There's also a church activity group he's in that does plays, and he likes to do that. So, I think we will see if he wants to explore that a little bit, because he does like it.
I am really happy with my kids who are doing well in math and science, probably because I am good at it too. I am a Chemistry teacher.
As a patient, I always liked math and science subjects, and did well in them. However, I don't find many women going into those fields, which is concerning.
I was at a conference this past week and most of the teachers there were male, very few females. It always gets me going because there should be more. I encourage the girls in my class to pursue sciences and math. In co-ed lab groups, girls usually take charge and tell the guys what to do.
I'm so happy for my son, who recently joined his school's sports team and today is his first home game. He's on cloud nine and I feel proud watching him play.
I've been watching my kids play sports for years, and it's different now that they're at a higher level than park district little leagues and weekend basketball games. My youngest is 8 years old, in 3rd grade, and he's getting into athletics too.
I am talking about my son who just finished playing soccer and is going to start playing basketball this Saturday. They have a 3rd and 4th grade team, but my son is in the 4th grade park district league, which doesn't allow him to play on a team at that level. However, my oldest son started playing there, so he's really excited about doing that.
I am Gina, and my son recently transitioned to the 3rd grade at his school. The school organizes an opera every year, and this time they performed 'The Magic Flute'. Surprisingly, my son landed the role of the prince and he performed really well!
I'm 38 years old and I have a sister who is 36, a brother who is almost 35, and another brother who is 28. My family is pretty close, but I remember seeing my parents argue when I was younger. My mom had a close handle on all of us and always knew where everybody was.
I think I understand why my mom is so protective and always wants us close by. She was adopted and her family is very important to her. I believe it's because of her adoption that she has these values.
Growing up, my mom and dad argued but it was always a situation where my dad would leave until he cooled down, and then he would come back and they would work it out. My dad never hit my mother because she was too strong a person to have let that happen. My dad is a teacher.
I come from a family of educators. My dad is a teacher at Kennedy-King College and teaches graphic art, communications, offset printing, and publications, while my mom is an administrator overseeing 35 or more pre-school sites on the south side of the city.
Recently at college, I saw someone who used to be close to me. He was there today and I realized I don't hate him. I have a boyfriend now.
I've been dating someone new and I think my ex-husband might find out about it through our kids. I don't want to forbid my kids from talking about it, but I'm curious to see how this situation will unfold since we all see each other due to our children.
I recently discovered that my ex and I still share some common interests and might cross paths in the future. However, I don't feel there's anything wrong with it as I don't have any connection with him anymore and I don't have to prove or defend anything with him.
I think I will be fine with the situation, and I hope that he will be okay with it too. Although he hasn't been mature with a lot of things, I will deal with it when it happens. But I'm just being hopeful and trying not to let things escalate.
I've been with my partner for a long time, and I am concerned that he might have some issues that might affect our relationship. I want to be cautious and take care of our bond, but I am not sure what to do.
I've been feeling overwhelmed lately. I tried staying busy with meaningful activities, but it's challenging with my teenage kids.
I am a teenage boy and I often find myself overwhelmed with so many things happening in my life. I feel like I won't be able to process and deal with all these things if I don't stop and take a look at them.
Well, the counseling has definitely helped. But it has made me realize that that's what I'm doing. Sometimes, I just go 'I'm too busy. Okay, we're not gonna do anything.' And just sort of slow down. I still have to do it more than I do.
I didn't know what quiet time was until one of my friends asked me about it. Now that I know, I find myself needing more of it sometimes.
I have been going through a tough time lately, but now I am getting back with my friends and reconnecting with my family. I am also participating in my children's activities.
I've been involved in various activities, some of which are my own and others that I participate in with others.
I didn't pick up on the signs earlier because I was stubborn and convinced that I could change him. I struggled with accepting our differences and had hoped that we could reach a point where we could work together.
I wanted to change the differences because they were too big. And if I didn't change 'em, that would mean we'd have problems. I didn't know his family extremely well, but they lived nearby.
I have a close relationship with my partner's mom, and we've talked about my partner's childhood issues. He struggled with following through on tasks, procrastination, not wanting to take blame, and being stubborn, insisting on doing things his way.
As a child, my mom would try to fix things for my brother and father. I think it's possible that my mom would have also tried to fix things for her husband. However, I never noticed any emotional or verbal cruelty between them. But sometimes I wonder if anyone in my family was influenced by their upbringing, as the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
I grew up with a feeling that my mother wasn't as happy as she could be. However, I never saw any signs of abuse during my childhood. I am the oldest among my two brothers and a sister.
I've been noticing that I appreciate when someone recognizes my qualities and praises me. It makes me feel valued, and I think this helps me determine whether I want to pursue a relationship with them. When I meet new people, I can often sense if someone might be problematic.
I feel really uncomfortable when people invade my personal space immediately. It sets me off, and I feel like they don't have the right to do that without my permission. I also get upset when they are rude to others.
I feel like in conversations, people should notice and compliment something good about me, like my husband didn't. I know I don't need compliments from everyone, but I like them and feel that I'm deserving of them. It means they actually see me for who I am.
I feel really uncomfortable when people get too possessive. My personal space gets closer and I don't want people to come in contact with me. I start to get stiffer.
I feel that I need to remove myself from the situation. My stomach doesn't hurt, my head doesn't hurt, but I just feel myself pulling back and withdrawing.
I thought I could make my unhappy partner happy and did my best, but now people are shocked that we're getting a divorce. Now, my current partner says that I don't pay him attention when we're alone.
I recently realized that I have been going through the motions for so long, and now I am dealing with a different person. If this person gets angry with me, I don't worry about it anymore and I don't take it personally.
I talk very openly with my partner about things, and we don't let a day go by without dealing with any issues. We don't live together and only see each other on weekends, as we are dating.
It's interesting, you know, to start getting back into dating and to be single again. Is that hard?
I have been struggling with how I see myself in society, especially regarding my gender and how it has influenced my placement and actions in it. I have noticed that there are certain expectations and it has led me to take responsibility for things that I now believe were not entirely positive behavior.
I managed to tolerate the verbal abuse for a long time, but I feel like if the physical abuse had occurred more frequently, I would have left the situation sooner.
I've been thinking about my past experiences, and I believe that I protected myself effectively, which is why the situations weren't as serious or as frequent as they could have been.
As a patient, I wasn't very proud of my past actions, but I have gotten a lot better. I found it very easy talking to you and I'm grateful for that.
As a patient, I recently met with a counsellor and discussed my progress towards building a new life for myself. I felt appreciative of the counselling session and thanked her multiple times as she told me that she thinks I'm doing great.
I'm divorced, raising two kids, and not looking for a serious relationship. I'm focusing on myself and being selfish for now. However, I still want to spend time and have fun with others. When I tell them about my situation, they seem to appreciate and believe my honesty.
I am seeing someone whom I've known since first grade, and we have been good friends for years, so it's very comfortable for me.
I recently met a guy at a party who gave me my personal space and we had conversations at a comfortable distance. He didn't crowd me right away, and that made an impression on me. I have learned through counseling that I'm entitled to have and should have my personal space.
I'm trying not to be too picky because everyone has their own way of doing things. So it's kind of their appearance, how they handle their self. They don't have to be knock-down gorgeous...
For me, it is important that the person I am talking to carries themselves well, can hold a conversation, and gives me my props as a woman.
I have been teaching for 11 years, and this is my fifth year in high school. I mostly teach sophomores, along with a few juniors and seniors who need to complete their last science course before they graduate. I used to teach at the junior high level for six years. I enjoy the interaction with the students, and it brightens my day.
As a high school teacher, I enjoy teaching kids more than dealing with the hormonal issues of junior high students. However, now I have to deal with it at home as well, as my 12-year-old is entering that stage. Luckily, my experience as a teacher has given me an advantage, and he seems to be okay with me being a teacher.
I am a teacher and my kids often expect me to take on the role of a teacher at home as well. Sometimes, this puts pressure on me to step up and do things for them. My youngest even wants to be in one of my classes someday. Overall, it has been both an advantage and disadvantage for them.
I'm going through a divorce which is almost final, and I'm quite happy about it.
I thought everything was going fine earlier, but now I've realized through counseling that it's not always okay. However, it's fine if things aren't going okay. Right now, I'm at a very good point in my life, and I'm so happy just this way.
I have been dealing with depression, but I am happy and pleased with the way my life is going now. However, I know there is that other side and I've experienced it at certain points. I know I can get through it, be happy again, and it's an evolving process. I'm less frightened of it now.
I have been going through a tough time but I have qualities that help me get through it, one of which is stubbornness. My mom calls it stick-to-it-iveness and says I'm a survivor.
I'm beginning to see that I'm surviving and I didn't take credit for that going on. I'm getting to know myself and accept myself, and I have my good points and my bad points.
Lately, I've been struggling a bit with impulsivity in my day-to-day life.
I'm nervous to go to the bar or group activities, but my friend might be able to help me feel more comfortable.
I have been talking about my struggles with accepting my sexuality, and I'm interested in hearing what other gay people who've gone through the process have experienced.
I am struggling with meeting other gay people and I would like to focus on finding ways to do so. I know there's a coming out support group that I saw an ad for on campus.
I'm thinking about going to a gay bar with my friend Rhianne, and she has some friends that I've met before, but they don't know about my sexuality. I want to get to know these people better.
I have considered joining a support group on campus, going to a gay bar with Rhianne, and asking Rhianne to introduce me to some of her gay friends. I also know about a group for friends and family of gay people, and maybe Rhianne would go with me there. I don't remember where I saw the ad for that group. I can't think of any other ideas, and I don't think there are any obstacles to pursue these options.
I think I would be more comfortable with maybe Rhianne going with me to a bar or either the bar or, or the group.
I was scared to be there and it was the primary feeling I had. This feeling, even before I got there, lasted throughout the whole situation. It made me feel like I wasn't myself and I couldn't be natural.
I didn't feel like I could be natural. I didn't feel like I wanted to talk about certain things and I couldn't really hear other people because I was so afraid and I couldn't pay attention to other people. I just wanted to get out of there.
I've been in a few different situations where I've had to hide the fact that I'm gay, and in those situations, I felt like I can't be myself, and I'm invisible. It feels like nobody can really see me.
I feel pressured because I see everyone around me in heterosexual relationships. My family keeps asking me when I'm going to get married and why I don't bring any girls around. I also see examples of these types of relationships on TV and in commercials, and I don't fit into that mold.
I'm afraid that people, including my family, will reject and hurt me if they find out about my sexual orientation. I've heard my brothers and father make gay jokes and it makes me feel that they might not accept or understand me.
As the patient, I have this long-held belief, and I mentioned that there have been a lot of messages from society and my family, like gay jokes. However, nobody has found out about my situation and consequently rejected me. I also haven't told anyone about it.
I don't know that, I'm just scared all the time. I feel like I just can't be who I am. I think I'm invisible and have to hide parts of who I am, which makes me feel unlovable. I have felt this way for as long as I can remember, even when I was younger.
I have had this belief for a long time that I am different and unlovable. I feel like people won't accept and love me if I don't follow the norm, like getting married or dating girls.
I feel like I don't fit in, I don't belong, and I am not lovable. This has been a core belief since I was a little boy
When I told Rhianne that I'm gay, she felt closer to me. I am afraid that others might not feel the same and may distance themselves from me.
I feel uncomfortable telling people that I'm gay, but it feels better than not telling them. It's because I'm not used to saying it out loud or telling someone close to me that I'm gay.
I think I can tell probably another friend about my situation, but I'm not sure who that would be. I have several friends that I think I can tell, maybe I can tell Didi. After telling Rhianne and what we've just talked about, I believe that maybe Didi would still like me and will feel closer to me.
I'm interested in reading something that could help me be more accepting of my gayness as I had a negative experience last time I tried to read on the subject.
I'm afraid that if people find out about my issue, they would reject me. I think I could test this belief by telling someone, maybe my friend Rhianne because she likes me and is a good friend.
I am worried about my friend Rhianne rejecting me if she finds out I am gay. I want to talk to her about it, but I am not sure what to say.
When I talked to my friend, Rhianne, she told me that she felt closer to me and would still be my friend. I guess she saw a different side of me.
I have been having trouble being consistent. I commit myself to do certain things, but the next day I have some more thoughts and then struggle to maintain a routine. For example, I want to take a shower once a day, but I'm not confident I can achieve that goal.
I am trying to improve myself but I'm struggling. Just for one week, I managed to make some progress. I feel like a 10 now, but if I have to do this for the rest of my life, I feel like I might move downward. What can I do?
I used to have a cholesterol level of 300, and then I managed to bring it down by 100 points. However, when I went to the doctor, he said it's still high and didn't even notice that I had made progress in reducing it.
I've been trying to improve my health by avoiding high cholesterol foods, sticking to a non-fat diet, and following the recommendations my doctor gave me.
I have a problem of joylessness. My life feels like a glass of Coca Cola that's been sitting out for a week, missing that effervescence in it. I would like it to be there at least 50% of the time.
Lately, I've been feeling some sort of issue, but I can't really pinpoint what it is. It happens about 25 to 50% of the time. I think I need you to ask questions to help me figure it out.
I wake up in the morning after experiencing a miracle at night. I don't know that the miracle has come, but because something better is in its place, I start noticing that things are different. I don't feel the overwhelming sense of doom and dread that I used to feel. Instead, I feel anticipation, like when I'm going to get up and go on vacation that day and I can't wait to get up.
I think I identify the effervescence with joy, which could be just joy of being, it doesn't have to be with an activity. Just being could be enough and then if you wanted to something besides then that's possible also. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the worst time in my life and 10 being the miracle state, I am at a 2 right now.
Lately, I've been feeling terrible, and I think my issues are at their worst. I can't remember a time when things have been a perfect 10.
I was at a 2 or 3 on my journey from my problems to the miracle, but I backslid. I was farther into 4-5 a year ago, but I think it was due to Tylenol with Codeine. I might have mistaken my progress with drug-induced illusions.
I don't know, opiates bring out the (inaudible). I backslid after going off opiates but didn't go all the way back to 0. I had a good therapist and learned that I just have to keep trying whether I fall down over and over.
I watch a lot of TV and clean the house while my partner is at work. I'm mostly bored most of the time. I remember not being bored when I was in school.
I'm taking English and history classes, and I find English to be the most exciting. When I think about going to school, I just feel like a typical student.
I talked with my husband about going back to school, because I think it would help me capture my old energy and bring out my best self. But it wasn't really my choice, and the conversation was more of him talking about it rather than me.
When I was 19, I married my husband, who is a year older than me. We've been thinking about starting a family. We wanted to do it earlier, but our financial situation didn't allow it. During conversations, I try to express my opinions, but my husband tends to talk most of the time.
Hi, I haven't been going to classes for the last month because I initially started school to help with finances at home after my husband lost his job. But now that he has found a job, we're okay financially and I don't need to go anymore. However, I would like to continue.
I am the patient in this scenario. Recently, my husband and I were arguing a lot about me not going to school. However, things have improved between us, and now our relationship is back to normal. I would describe my current feelings as being a little bit bored.
I feel so bored and when I'm bored, I usually distract myself by trying not to think about it. It's just me at home during the day.
I've tried talking to my father about my school work, my activities, and my friends, but he just doesn't seem to want to hear it. He works in IT and went to college, but he mainly sees it as a way of getting a job.
I feel like there's no point in discussing my English classes with my future kids when they're babies. My partner thinks it's something he has to do, but I don't see how it improves the quality of our lives.
I have a vision of a future family with three kids, two boys and a girl. I want them to do well in school and be happy. I believe the best way to teach them that is by being there for them. But, I'm worried that if I go to school, I won't be able to be a good student, mom, and wife at the same time. It's too much.
I was okay in school, I wasn't bad, better than I thought. But school is hard and having kids is hard too.
I guess the cultural norm of women staying at home and taking care of the family, which I initially accepted, is bothering me now since I've started going to school. I'm not sure if I'm still okay with it.
I don't think my family would support me going back to class because of my age and timing. I didn't go to college right after high school and now it's time for me to have kids. We don't have any children yet and wanted to start earlier, but our financial situation wasn't good.
I feel okay financially right now and don't need to go to school, which makes it a good time to start a family. But when I talk about going to school, my whole body lights up and I feel excited.
I have a friend named Lauren who brought me to this counselling session. She sees more potential in me than I see in myself. We attend the same class and hang out with other classmates after class.
I don't think going to school matters to my husband. I feel like what matters to me isn't what's best for the family, and I can't do what I want because it's not just me. I am making this decision alone, and I don't think my husband would be willing to participate in the process.
Lately, I've been interested in learning more about my own culture, but I'm hesitant to explore it without my husband. I don't want him to think I'm going behind his back. I'm also not sure where to start.
I can do some things, right. I can, I can be a good student. And I know I can be a good parent too, but I don't think I can do both. And, he doesn't want me to do both. And he's right. It's gonna be hard. And what if, you know, what if something happens to my kid when I'm in class, and I'm not there. It would be, it would be, it's very hard.
I was quiet and didn't talk much in high school. My grades were okay, though. I went to a four-year college for a semester but dropped out because I hated it. I used to like English classes.
I chose to major in Biology because it seemed like one of the few fields with long-term success and prestige. However, I wasn't very good at the bio, chem, and calc classes. I think I got into this major mainly due to my parents' influence, as they wanted me to have a prestigious career like a doctor or lawyer, which is common in Chinese families.
I feel caught in a place where I have to balance my parents' expectations, my husband's expectations, and what I want, which is different from what they want.
I have talked to Julie in a certain way, and I believe I have a good reason to talk to her that way. Do you think you should also talk to her like that?
I feel like I have been talking to someone in a wrong way, but I don't want to make things worse. Should I approach her and try to figure something out?
I am having a difficult time with a teacher and I feel like the counsellor needs to talk to her differently. I know it's not good for the counsellor to badmouth teachers, but I accept that. I'm willing to make an effort, but I'm not sure what to say or do in order to improve the situation.
Lately, I've been having some issues with my friend. When she does something that bothers me, instead of discussing it with her, I just give her a certain look.
I'm feeling overwhelmed with the thought of attending classes one night a week for the next eight months. I don't even know how to get the homework and I'm missing a class tonight. Can you help me?
I have trouble catching up with my school assignments. My friends don't share the homework with me, and I don't want to ask my teacher for it.
I've been struggling with a particular teacher at school who seems to be mean to me. I want to find a way to talk to her and let her know that I'm not as bad as she thinks. I've been meeting with a counselor to help me manage this situation and we've planned to meet after school. I'm curious if the counselor would try to talk to her today and let her know that I'm trying? 
I have to kind of get some in- . . . than she thinks. I have to get some, you know how you have to sense things. Just tell her I'm not as bad.
I like that idea. I'm struggling with a difficult coworker, and I'm thinking of trying to break the ice by just sitting down and saying good morning. Will that make her realize something is going on and maybe help improve our relationship?
I'm struggling with school, especially with reading and writing. I don't really turn in my homework because it feels pointless. I don't understand half of it, and my teacher never explains it to me like she does with everyone else.
I'm constantly getting scolded by my teacher for not turning in my homework and being told to stay after class or go to detention. I really hate homework and think it's stupid.
I don't really like the idea of doing homework, but since you seem like a nice person who likes kids, I guess I can give it a try.
I feel upset when my teacher talks to me like I'm nothing and I'm not taking that. I want someone to say something to her about it.
I am having trouble with a teacher who treats me poorly, and I want her to talk to me nicely and not treat me like crap. I know her better than you since I am in her class every day. I believe if you tell her that she's a bad teacher, that she is boring, and that she doesn't care about her students, it would aggravate her.
I am really worried that things might get worse if I act in a certain way. I don't want to make things any worse than they already are but I'm not sure how to handle this situation.
I feel like the juvenile workers and teachers are all the same, constantly bossing the kids around and treating them badly. A friend of mine ended up in an adult facility and it was even worse.
I feel like everyone, including the police, is out to get me and my friends. Recently, my friend got into trouble with the police, and now they seem to be keeping a closer eye on us.
Recently, I've been on probation and I have a male probation officer assigned to me.
I feel so frustrated that I have to take a UA every week just because I got caught using some drugs and alcohol. It's annoying having the constant lectures, especially when I'm at school. I really dislike my probation officer.
I am 15 years old and I have smoked marijuana about four times. Is it really a big deal if I smoke a little pot?
I'm not sure who exactly, but I think one of my teachers sent me here to talk to you. I don't really talk to them, so I don't know what they might be saying about me.
I am a 15-year-old student who is often told to sit down, shut up, and do my work in class. My classmates seem unhappy with me and don't talk much.
I feel like I have to go to school, even if I don't want to. It's like the law or something, and everyone expects me to attend.
I have to attend school until I'm 16, which is in eight months. I don't want to go to juvenile detention, but I have a couple of friends there.
As a patient, I'd say that the food at the facility is gross and the environment seems to be locked down all the time, making it feel terrible.
Lately, I haven't been talking to adults much and I rarely agree with them. But, right now, I find myself agreeing with you and this seems like not such a bad place to talk.
I feel like I'm not being heard or treated fairly at school. I think adults should be nicer to kids and not treat them differently based on their family background.
I feel like teachers are trying to get rid of kids like me and the principal is part of the problem. I need someone to give me a break. I think a good start would be for teachers to stop treating kids like me poorly.
I feel awful because people have been treating me like crap. I think it would be good if they would stop doing that.
I smoke pot once a week, which is about 50 times a year. If I get caught one out of 25 times, that's twice a year. If I do this for five years, that's a total of 10 times getting caught. Is it really that big of a deal or is it just blown out of proportion? Have you ever smoked pot?
I don't drink coffee or smoke cigarettes, and caffeine makes me feel crazy. I am wondering how I can get out of this situation.
I know you're just trying to help, but every time I talk to someone like you, they always tell me the same thing - I need to get my grades up, stop smoking pot, go back to class, and do work. It's frustrating because I've heard it so many times, and it feels like nobody understands.
As a patient, I have been dragged into the guidance counselor's office for the same issues countless times, maybe around 50 times.
I feel upset because someone told me that I'm not going anywhere in my life, which I think is a lie. This same person also tells me to shut up when I talk. While it's not a lie that I talk, I find her telling me to shut up very rude.
I talk a lot during the boring class, and I feel like the teacher hates me and she's stupid. I also don't do homework, but there's a reason behind that. And, I do smoke a little pot.
I feel frustrated because the way adults talk about pot, it's like they're overreacting. In my opinion, it is way better than drinking. You don't see people smoking pot and killing others on the roads. I don't want to be lied to, but I want them to be more respectful when telling the truth.
I feel like people should talk to me respectfully rather than in a degrading manner. It's important for me to be treated like a human being.
As a student, I have this habit of not greeting my teacher properly. I can say 'Good morning Ms. Bannan' but I might not be able to smile while saying it.
I tried saying 'Good morning' to Ms. Bannon, but I felt so fake saying it. I'm worried that it will sound fake for a while. What if she says something rude?
I am struggling with my teacher's behavior towards me. She is always rude and it's difficult for me to deal with her. I usually come in, look at her, and then go to see my friends. But she yells at me and tells me to go sit down and be quiet.
I feel like my mother is always trying to find ways to criticize me, and it's really getting to me. I want to make it hard for her to find anything to criticize, but I'm not sure how. What should I do?
I just get so mad when I see her. Maybe I could just not look at her. Like just not make eye contact with her. Because I feel like she looks at me the same way.
I've never greeted a teacher with a smile before, but I'm upset with what's going on at school. I want you to do something about it, but I'm not sure if I should greet my teacher with a 'Good morning' and a smile.
I find it really hard when I think of her, and I feel like saying 'Good morning' is no big deal, but it was difficult for me.
I feel like everything around me is just pretending, like movies or TV shows. It's not very fulfilling. I also play a lot of Nintendo DS, which could be adding to that feeling of disconnection.
I'm having issues with all my teachers, but the worst one is Ms. Bannan. She disrespects me, talks down to me in front of other students and yells at me.
My teacher humiliates me in front of the class, she says things like 'Julie, shut up, sit down. You're no good. You're not going to amount to anything.' She never listens to me and treats me like a nobody in the school.
I've been struggling with feeling that nobody takes me seriously. When I share my ideas, people seem to dismiss them as lies or insignificant. But when I heard you appreciate my lecture, it made me feel like someone finally understood and cared about what I had to say.
I don't think she has one nice bone in her body. I'm not bad, but it seems like everyone else thinks I am, except for you.
I've been having some issues with Ms. Bannan, and I've made a couple of little mistakes. I'm willing to work on them if you talk to her. I always follow through on what I say I'm going to do.
I am going to talk to the counsellor briefly in the hallway after today's session, and tomorrow morning on my way to school, I need to stop by their office to report how my homework went tonight. I was wondering if I could come during math, but I was told to come before school starts.
As a patient, I agreed to a plan that my counsellor and I discussed, but I'm still feeling a bit unsure about committing to it. I hesitated before shaking hands to seal the agreement.
I've been feeling very needy lately, and I've been trying to turn up the volume on my neediness to better understand it. Now I think I should try the opposite, like being more powerful and self-sufficient instead of needy.
I feel like I can't manage things on my own and need someone to pick up the telephone for me. I'm trying to imagine myself as powerful and self-sufficient, like going to the movies alone.
As a patient, I sometimes feel like I don't need to talk with anyone as I have a full life and can do other things on my own. I believe I am powerful and self-sufficient, and although relationships are important, I can live without being in one.
I recently practiced switching between being needy and being powerful and self-sufficient during a therapy session. I felt complete on my own and really enjoyed embracing that persona. It wasn't annoying or overbearing, but just right. How can I make use of these experiences?
I feel this sense of neediness that I don't like at all. When I feel needy, I whine and become annoying, and I want to change that.
I feel like no one is there for me and I need someone to be there. I can't live without support and it feels like people are not picking up the phone when I need them.
I've been feeling extremely needy lately, and when I hear myself, I find it really annoying. I want to change this but don't know how.
I feel like I tend to exaggerate things and that makes me come across as needy. I'm trying to focus on turning down the volume and not being so overwhelming.
I want to learn to be more confident, more self-assured, and more powerful.
I feel hurt when I'm around my partner because all our arguments are based on his parents, and I feel like he sides with them more than he does with me. I guess I repress so many of my feelings and I don't know what to do about it.
I am angry and frustrated with my male friend's family because they are not accepting of me and our relationship. They have always been this way for generations, and now my friend is foolishly listening to them. I feel that they should be happy for us instead of trying to control their son's choices.
I'm in the process of breaking up with my boyfriend of five years, and it's strictly over a religion issue, which I find very difficult. I feel a lot of resentment towards him and his family, as I think they dictate to him and were instrumental in the breakup.
My relationship ended because of my partner's parents, who constantly interfered in our lives. It's so blatant, and I can feel their interference even when I'm with them alone or when my partner is around. I just can't help but feel resentful about it.
I am a very sensitive person, and when people act badly towards me, it makes me feel extremely angry. I end up feeling an overwhelming sense of rejection.
I guess I'm belittling myself by letting them, you know, impose that, so I feel rejected by them and I feel very hurt and downed about that. I also feel angry about the rejection.
I often feel conflicted and angry, and sometimes I can't control it. I also feel vulnerable and weak because my parents instilled in me to not be vulnerable. I want to change, but self-criticism does not make me act stronger.
I just realized that I'm going to feel vulnerable and weak at times, and that's okay.
I've been feeling affected by others' actions and opinions lately, and I feel like I should be strong enough to not let them bother me. I know I can't change them, but I still wish I had the power to stop their negative impact on me.
I don't know if I evade, or it's my protection mechanisms, but when anyone puts me down or acts badly to me and I cannot stop them, I feel weak. I know I should take a deep breath and remind myself that I'm a good person, but still, it causes so much conflict.
As a patient, I told my counsellor that I usually avoid cleaning my apartment as it is something I find annoying and obnoxious.
I guess the main thing is I just find so much overwhelming resentment towards my partner because he can't stand up to his parents.
I have been feeling anxious in my marriage lately because my husband and I don't really talk anymore. It seems like we're on different pages and not connecting like we used to, even just six months ago. We haven't tried couple's therapy because my husband isn't really into it, so I thought I'd come to therapy alone first.
I've never done this before, and to be honest, I felt a little awkward during our first session. I don't want to hurt your feelings or anything, but I'm not sure if this is a good fit for me.
I am feeling really anxious and a little bit overwhelmed. I am having some trouble with my marriage and work is getting really tough too. I find myself feeling like I don't have time for anything or anyone, and I think it's just the stress of everything building up. My husband and I have been married for about a year and a half, and we haven't been talking to each other very much and don't even eat dinner together anymore.
I've been married for about a year and a half. My husband and I met in college. I had a dog when we first met, but it was a different one than I have now.
I'm really confused and I've never had therapy before. This is my first experience.
As a patient, I'm curious if the way you suggest reading the inventory to me and recording the outcomes is the normal procedure for this situation.
I recently met a new counsellor, Dr. Vedha. They seemed quite friendly and supportive. During our conversation, they assured me that I would be fine and encouraged me to come back if I had any issues. It felt good to be there and have a nice interaction with Dr. Vedha.
I had a therapy session and felt awkward since some questions didn't seem related to my marriage issues. I'm not sure if it's because of my blindness, but I just want to focus on my marital problems and anxiety.
I was in an argument with my partner, and he called me selfish, saying that everything is about me and he's always on my time. I was crying and couldn't find the right words to tell him that's not true. I felt silenced and it happens every time he gets mad at me.
I rarely get to share my side of the story in arguments. I wish I could have said that I'm sorry for being late, but I couldn't leave due to my stressful job. I didn't mean to hurt or embarrass anyone.
I felt really good standing up for myself, but it's scary to do so.
My week wasn't good. I got into a huge fight with Kevin. He yelled at me and was screaming. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm exhausted and overwhelmed with this relationship. I feel like he just walks all over me all the time and I don't have a voice in my relationship. He doesn't seem to care about my feelings at all.
I'm really upset because my boyfriend always blames me for everything in our relationship, and I feel like I'm never able to get him to see my side of things. We had a big fight recently when I was late to meet his friends at a restaurant because I got held up at work, and he was really angry at me.
Lately, I have been feeling very down and I'm not sure why. I'm often pessimistic and struggle to find motivation to do anything. Is it normal to feel this way?
Uh… I think especially with him it's been my challenge in our relationship, but I mean I'm just fed up to the point where I can't, I can't take this anymore like I, I just, I'm, I'm so angry and frustrated when I'm not even with him anymore. I feel worse when I don't stand up for myself and I'm miserable so I think that's something I can at least try attempt to do the next time he gets upset.
I think honestly, like an eight. I just don't want to be walked all over anymore.
I've been struggling with the decision of having my dad walk me down the aisle at my wedding. It's scary to imagine having that conversation because our relationship has been strained since he left when I was 12. I have so many things to say to him, and I feel hurt and abandoned.
I found it hard to express my feelings without becoming emotional. I felt exposed and vulnerable discussing about whether my father should walk me down the aisle in my wedding, which is a decision that's been bothering me for weeks.
I just did two role plays, and I realized that even though I thought I wouldn't know what to say to a particular person, a part of me actually knows what I would want to say to them.
I've been feeling anxious and torn about having my dad walk me down the aisle at my wedding, given our rocky relationship since he left my family when I was 12. I'm still unsure if I'm making the right decision in letting him be a part of my life again, especially on such a big day.
Lately, I have been struggling with the decision of letting my dad back into my life. Today, I realized that I know how I feel about it more than I thought I did. It's reassuring, but I'm still unsure if I should discuss my feelings with him or not. I would like your guidance on this matter.
I feel like the less people know about my personal life, the better things are for me. I struggle with trying to maintain my privacy while still being honest with others, which can be difficult.
I think I would be happier if I just didn't choose people I like, people that I do. I live in a small town and every school has its problems. I'm friends with everybody, and they don't really like that.
I think I know I'm a good person and a good kid, but it's really hard when people don't see that. I've tried to be upfront in the past, but it hasn't worked out well. So I'm wondering if I should try it again or not.
I have tried to do something again, but people accuse me of lying, sneaking around, and going to places I shouldn't. I want to clarify that I'm not a kid and I don't do anything bad.
As a teenager, my parents have completely lost trust in me because they think I'm just being a typical teenager, and I don't know how to show them that I'm responsible when they aren't compromising.
I'm struggling with finding personal space without alienating my family. I don't want to lose them, but I need some space. I'm not sure how to communicate this with them.
I'm having issues with my parents because they're hardheaded and don't seem to understand my honest requests. I want to make decisions for myself, whether they like it or not.
I feel like I might go against things they don't like, but in the end, it's still going to be my decision and not theirs. Some of their preferences will be included in my final choices.
I feel like my parents are declining their chances on me, and I just want to be able to tell them where I'm going without them being worried or mad. I want to have an open and honest relationship with them.
I just want to get out and move out because I feel like the rules are too restrictive. I wish that I could be allowed to do my own thing and be myself, but it's not possible right now.
I feel like I should be able to make my own decisions and mistakes, but my parents still hold the responsibility for me. Even though I'm nearing 18, I don't have any experience and it's frustrating.
I want to learn from my own experiences and I don't think you should have a say in who I date. I believe that it's my own opinion and feelings, and if I want to explore a relationship, I should be able to.
I've tried to resolve the issue, but I'm so close to being 18 and there's nothing they can really do about it. I don't want to ruin my relationships with my family.
I have been feeling a lot of pressure from my family and friends about moving out soon. Over the next year and a half, I could just move out but I am anxious about all the responsibilities and expectations that come with living on my own.
You know, I try to understand where they're coming from, but sometimes it's just really hard because I know my side. Their side seems so close-minded, and they don't realize that their approach is not helping me in the long run. I think when I go to college, they could always do worse. I could be some drugged-out kid, you know.
I feel like my parents are being very strict and it's awful. They even think a simple ear piercing is unacceptable and it's just ridiculous.
I think my friends got upset because they wanted more honesty from me. They didn't like it when I hung out with someone without letting them know, and I believe that made them lose trust in me.
I feel so frustrated because I can't make my own decisions due to other people's influence.
I've been trying to demonstrate more honesty in my life, but my friends and family are now getting mad at me for doing so. When I try to express my feelings openly, they get upset and I don't feel like there's any positive reinforcement for my honesty.
I come from a Christian family and they're really strict about things like piercings. I don't have any piercings personally but I've always wanted one at the top of my ear. My family's rigid structure and routine are causing me unhappiness.
I want to do something rebellious to have a sense of release, but I'm not allowed to. Everything in my life is structured and disciplined, and it's getting really difficult for me. I feel like I need that release because I'm still a teenager.
I'm not into partying but I can't understand why some kids do it. Also, I feel a little trapped in my relationship with my parents as I'm boxed in and there's not much room to express myself. Even our house isn't really big, so there's not a lot to talk about under the same roof.
I can't talk on the phone about some things, so I can't talk to anybody about how I feel. I can't tell them my secrets or talk to my friends.
Lately, I feel really overwhelmed with everything that's going on. I don't have a lot of time for myself, and I'm not allowed to make my own decisions. It's just very overwhelming, and I feel trapped. My parents play a big part in this, as they control some of the decisions in my life, and I'm not pleased with it.
Some of the situations I don't really mind and I don't really care. I let others take the wheel. However, in some cases, I feel like I'm getting old enough to where I should be able to handle it and know I should be able to, but sometimes I can't really say much about it and struggle to fight it.
I feel like my life is a lost cause because I don't have any say in my decisions. I am mature for my age, but I'm constantly facing tough decisions that are beyond my years. On top of that, my schedule is so packed with school and work that I don't have time for myself.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with my daily routine. It goes like this: I go to school, come back home, do my homework, and then go to bed. I don't have time for anything else.
I feel overwhelmed and need some space and time because I work all the time. Whenever I try to ask for space, it ends up in a fight. A recent instance was related to dating.
Lately, I find myself arguing with my friends about how closed-minded they are about not liking someone's parents or their history. I try to fight them on this and make them see that it's not based on the person, but they don't listen.
I told my family that I don't know what else to do without moving out or graduating, and that I can't do this for another year. They weren't too happy about it.
I'm considering moving out, but I'm worried about money being an issue. It's getting more and more realistic that I could actually do it, but I'm concerned about any potential problems that could arise.
I feel like I'm reaching a breaking point in my life and that soon, when I'm 18, I'll be out of high school and experiencing major changes.
Lately, I haven't been talking to my friends much. I only talk to them at school occasionally, but I'm more reserved. I feel overwhelmed and like if I get caught in their drama, it's just something else I have to deal with.
I feel boxed in and like I can't be myself around my parents. I've tried changing the situation, but they were even unsupportive of someone I dated.
I had a fight with my parents because they took away my freedom to make decisions about discipline, structure, and who I want to date. I didn't like this guy, but now they tell me I can't date him. It's embarrassing to tell someone you can't date them because your parents don't like them.
Lately, I feel embarrassed about my situation, and I don't date or bring anyone home. When I do hang out with someone, I avoid telling them about my problems because they might get mad or upset.
Lately, I've been facing some issues with my parents. As a 17 year old, I'm constantly trying to persuade them and negotiate for more space and freedom, but it seems to be an ongoing struggle.
I have tried different strategies in the past to deal with my issues, but they haven't really helped me get the results I wanted.
I'm feeling overwhelmed and stressed because I don't have enough time for myself, and I have to deal with problems at home too. I'm trying to stay connected to my parents but it's hard to make my own decisions without alienating them.
I've been feeling unreasonable lately and it's affecting me so much. At my age, I feel like some people are like that, but I don't know how to handle it or what to say to my parents.
I want to make my own decisions and make my own mistakes, and let me learn from them.
I've been feeling worried about making decisions for my parents and I think moving out would be great for our relationship. My older brother moved out and he always talks about how much better his relationship is with mom and dad.
I feel like living with my family is not really possible, but moving out presents some serious obstacles in many ways. I don't want them to think I'm trying to get back at them, but I believe in the end it'll be better.
I had a big fight with my parents, and they think I am not mature enough to make some decisions, like dating. They want me to act more responsibly, but I already work, go to school, and complete my homework. I don't know how to show them I am responsible.
I think I should choose more responsible people in my life and make some changes. However, I am unsure about what others would see me doing differently or how they would perceive these changes.
I feel trapped and overwhelmed. I want more freedom, and I want my parents to accept me more instead of criticizing me. I want them to let me make my own decisions and mistakes.
I'm worried about turning 18 soon and having more honest conversations with people around me. What are some points that I haven't tried or have?
I've tried every way to be honest with my parents because I am an open and honest person. There are times I present stuff to my parents that they may not like, but at least I'm telling them. Sometimes, though, I don't tell them where I'm going.
I don't go out often, but when I do, I always complete my homework first. However, I still have no privacy and I just want to go out and have fun.
I wish my parents would give me some space and understand that I need room to make my own choices. I try to balance everything and understand where they're coming from, but it's really hard.
I feel like I want more freedom and to be treated more maturely, but my current approach of arguing, fighting, or avoiding things doesn't seem to be working. I think things might get better once I move out, but I still have another year and a half to go, and my parents don't seem to understand that they're not preparing me for the future.
I feel like my parents are overprotective and close-minded, not allowing me to learn from my own mistakes. They don't realize that I'm older now and need some space.
I used to be okay with my parents making decisions for me when I was younger, but now I realize they won't be the ones choosing important things like who I'm going to marry. So I feel unprepared to make these big decisions on my own and don't want to include them.
I can't be open with my parents as much as most kids can be.
I want a relationship where they reinforce honesty rather than presenting negatively about it. I want a mature relationship where I can make my own decisions and if they don't like it, they just sit back and watch.
I've been feeling like I'm just taking things as they come, but maybe there's nothing wrong with learning from my experiences, no matter if they're good or bad. I don't know who will help me with this, but I think I need to try a new approach.
I've been trying to take more initiative in dealing with my stress, but it's causing disruption in my home environment.
I think it'll be better for me, but I'm still a little hesitant about the whole upsetting them...
I still love my parents, but I'm struggling because I have to deal with a difficult situation for another year and a half.
Recently, I've been struggling with this feeling of being trapped, and I don't know what to do about it.
I think the relationship I have with my dog, Emmy, has been more profound than I ever thought my relationship with an animal could be. I hadn't really thought about it in those terms before, but she has been a huge asset in helping me learn to make attachments, especially when I've had my heart broken to an extreme amount and don't want to trust again.
I have been experiencing some pain, but I'm finding some progress and relief lately. I have a great teacher who has been sweet and helpful. She's a good listener and talks a lot. Does that make sense?
My pet seems to be really upset with me when I come home. She growls and makes noises like 'Where have you been?'. She's vocal when she doesn't like something I've done, but I don't know what it is that I've done. She demanded that I take her home from the pet store, and she has interesting survival skills.
I am a pet owner and I have one small dog at this time. It's a female dog. I feel uncomfortable when discussing certain topics.
I have a pet named Emmy-May, but I usually introduce her as Emmy. I call her Emmy during average interactions, but I use Emmy-May to get her attention or if she tries to take off.
My sister and I are the only two in our family with those names, and May is my sister's middle name. She named her cat after me, so I felt a need to get even with her. When she's in trouble, I do what our mother used to do - I call her by her full name, Emmy-May, so she knows.
I have a cat, and its name is actually my nickname, which is Birdy.
I had a really tough time during the first couple of months in my relationship. I felt bad because she was really cute and liked to chase the ball, even playing soccer and kicking it.
I have a lot of videos where I can be heard laughing, but having to take care of someone and the financial responsibility was really difficult for me. It was a hard time because I wanted a distraction, and the situation became painful as I didn't want to care for her. I was also afraid that it would break my heart if she passed away.
I got my friend to distract me from certain health issues, but those issues are still there even though she helps me momentarily.
I think after a few months with my dog, I became a different dog mom because she's just so happy to see me, and she's very grateful for anything I do for her. Her excitement made me excited to see her, and I want her to experience happiness because she brings me happiness. I want her to have fun and play. Does that sound crazy?
Lately, I've been struggling with some issues, and I'm not really sure how to navigate through them.
Talking about my dog with you feels a bit silly, but she is a source of happiness for me and discussing her is helpful for my current emotional state. I hope that answers your question.
Lately, I've been struggling a lot. For the past three weeks, I haven't wanted to go out or do anything. I'm not working because I'm on a break, and I've been finding comfort in my dog. She stays with me on the couch when I don't feel like leaving it and is always present with me.
I have noticed that my dog has been by my side constantly for the last three weeks, no matter my mood or the difficulties I face. I'm not sure what she senses, but her presence has been very comforting to me. Does that make sense?
As a patient, I find the therapy very comforting.
I got a dog, hoping it would help me deal with my emotional pain, but she got sick and needed a significant financial and emotional commitment from me. I had to change my schedule and push my selfishness aside to take responsibility for her. Unfortunately, she wasn't the solution I needed, and I still had to face my issues.
Sometimes, I get distracted by my current difficult situation, and it keeps me from focusing on the core issues that I've been avoiding. But even when my current problem is solved, the underlying issues are still there.
I was going through a really difficult time when school was intense and I had an injury. I felt like it would be easier if I didn't have to deal with all this. I got really close to harming myself, late one night when I drove to the train tracks and thought all I had to do was drive onto them or sit there and everything would be gone.
I had a close call with harming myself before, but for some reason, I didn't go through with it. I'm not sure what stopped me that night, but I'm still feeling uncertain and worried about my future mental state. I don't know if that thought will happen again, and if it does, I'm afraid I might not make the same choice to stay in the car.
As your patient, I've been feeling really low lately and my thoughts are constantly revolving around self-harm. I understand that this is a concerning situation and I'm sharing this with you in hopes of finding some help.
I've been feeling depressed lately due to the overwhelming workload of graduate school and not being able to use sports, like tennis, as an escape. I recently suffered a shoulder injury that has stopped me from playing tennis, which used to help me relax and take my mind off of the stress. Now, with no physical activity, I constantly feel overwhelmed and unable to do anything.
I feel immobilized both physically and emotionally. I don't have any motivation to do anything. I spend 10 to 15 hours at school and come home only to sit and watch TV. Watching tennis highlights frustrates me because it reminds me of what I can't do. I constantly receive cues that make me feel like my situation is harder than I realize. This leaves me feeling helpless and frozen.
I have been feeling quite overwhelmed and immobilized recently. Last week, it got to the point where I just couldn't take it anymore due to an injury that was going to put me out.
I recently promised my counsellor that I would be there for our next session and not harm myself in any way. My counsellor then mentioned something about writing a life maintenance agreement to solidify our pledge.
Yeah. I mean, I can, I can come into that very, very day.
I can't guarantee anything about not harming myself, and I don't know what's going to happen in the coming days or weeks. A month is a long time, and I don't know how long I'll be dealing with this injury and how intense school will get. Currently, things seem to be on a day-to-day basis, and I can't commit to anything for a week.
I've been struggling and feeling really down lately. My counsellor suggested scheduling an appointment for me tomorrow, and asked me to promise not to harm myself between now and that appointment. I'm not sure if I can make it through today, but I guess if it's just one day, I can try.
I have an older brother who loves the attention from my friends, and I get a kick out of telling him that they think he's cute. We're generally cool with each other, and I like that we're both seen as cool when we go places together. But sometimes, it can also be a bit frustrating with his approval or disapproval of who I talk to.
My friends and people around me don't really see what goes on in our house. They think everything is perfect on the outside. My parents have been arguing a lot lately and I'm even scared that they might get a divorce like it happened with one of my friends. It's kind of scary.
I'm really worried about my family, especially since my parents are considering separating. The thought of them being apart is frightening. It's particularly concerning because my mom is the oldest sibling in her family, and everyone goes to her for advice. So, her family would have a lot to say about the situation, and I think she feels a lot of pressure.
I was really upset with my brother, and then everything hit me at once. You know, like when you're feeling something and you are already upset, and then other people say and do things to you that pile up, making it hard to endure.
I didn't really mean it when I said I wanted to hurt myself. I was just really mad, hurt, and frustrated with my family, especially with how my parents have been arguing. I have never thought about actually killing myself.
I don't have any reason to hurt myself. I hear about young kids doing harmful things like taking drugs, but I know it's stupid and would never do something like that.
I feel left out because my family always encouraged my brothers to participate in sports and improve their skills, but they never really thought I should be in sports. My mom always tells me that I should stay at home and my friends are not into sports either.
I recently tried to go to prom with someone, but my mom said I could only go with my brother. She always tells my brother to watch me at school and make sure I don't talk to boys, which is really frustrating. I feel like I don't need another parent.
I feel frustrated because my brother is not always there for me, and he's not the boss of me. My parents are already strict enough. I also see him with girls in the hallway, and he thinks he's so cool, especially around this popular girl, Stephanie.
I was talking to my brother and he mentioned that Stephanie told someone she thinks I'm hot and cool because I play lots of sports. But if someone said that about my sister, he would think she has a bad reputation.
I feel like my mom is embarrassed by me and makes me wear a scarf at the mosque even though I don't wear hijab outside the mosque. I don't understand why I should wear a scarf and it makes me feel like a hypocrite.
I'm feeling pressured by my mom to wear a scarf, even though my other friends don't wear it and my dad doesn't push me to wear it. My mom is adamant about me wearing it, even though she only wears it when going to the mosque. I feel that I should have the right to decide whether or not I want to cover my hair.
I'm constantly pressured by my sister to stay at home and not go out because she thinks my friends are a bad influence on me. She tells me people in the community talk negatively about me and that I should be more like her to avoid that. But I disagree and even our mother doesn't have a problem with my choices.
I have a few good friends that I trust, and they're like my sisters. We do everything together, like shopping and our parents hang out. But there are some things I want to do with them that someone won't allow me to.
I feel like my mom is talking to my teachers because she's scared that I'm not getting good grades. They said that I may fail the tenth grade if I don't make my grades up, and I'm trying my best. I'm frustrated and not understanding my mom and dad, and things at home are really weird.
I feel like my parents are always arguing and it seems like nothing I do is good enough for them. No one understands me, except for my friend Mariam. She knows exactly how I'm feeling without me having to say anything. Recently, my parents made me delete my MySpace account, which really frustrated me.
I just feel like everybody wants to tell me what to do, and I'm upset with the way my family thinks of me. I feel like they're ashamed of me, like I'm an embarrassment. Compared to my brothers, they have scholarships and my older brother got to go away to school.
I am really worried about embarrassing my mom with my actions, but I don't know exactly how I am doing that. I've thought about it several times.
I find it really annoying when my brother treats me like a child in school. Between classes, we sometimes cross paths in the hallway as our lockers are nearby. When he sees a boy talking to me, he gives weird looks and sometimes tells me to go to class. I feel frustrated because it feels like I'm being controlled and I already get enough of that from our parents.
I am so frustrated because my brothers get all this freedom and I don't get the same treatment. I feel like my parents are hypocrites. My brother gets to spend so much free time with his friends and stays out late while I have to sit at home, bored and lonely. I feel like nobody understands me and I can't relate to anyone.
I've been feeling really pressured by my mom lately, and I feel closer to my dad because he doesn't put as much pressure on me. I haven't talked to either of them about how I feel.
I wanted to spend the night at my friend Kate's house for a celebration. She lives close by, and my parents know her address and have her phone number. My dad sometimes lets me use his cellphone, but my mom takes mine away. I don't understand why I cannot stay at her house for the night, especially since she's an only child, and there won't be any boys present.
I feel frustrated because my mom won't let me go out, saying that girls should stay at home and it's improper to be outside. I love my family, but I want to spend time with my other friends too.
I just feel so claustrophobic like everybody wants to tell me what to do. They tell me not to dress like that, not to talk on the phone too long, my hair is not right, and the way I dress is improper. I feel like nobody cares about my opinion, and I'm just floating around, being told to be this and that. Moreover, I recently had a fight with my brother at school.
As the patient, I am upset because I got into a fight at school. I was walking in the hallway when it happened.
I feel like people are pressuring me to get married and have babies instead of going to school and getting good grades. I don't want to live like that. I just want a chance to know myself.
I feel pressured by my mom who constantly asks me to be more like her. She always talks about our culture and tells me to respect the rules of the mosque, like wearing a scarf. Sometimes I take it off because it messes up my hair, and my friends wonder why I wear it at the mosque and not outside.
I feel like a hypocrite and I'm having a hard time finding where I belong. I'm not comfortable in the mosque situation and I don't have friends who participate in that. I'm also having a hard time finding my place at home and school. Sometimes, my mom is really loving and open, but other times she's strict.
I'm feeling confused because my mom and dad don't encourage me to be involved in sports which I enjoy. They only focus on my academics.
I feel pressured by my mother to be perfect, and she thinks I'm rude to my grandparents because I don't always speak Arabic with them. I understand the language, but I prefer speaking English as well. Why can't my grandparents sometimes speak English to me?
As a patient, I'm concerned about my mom wanting us to stop speaking Arabic because we live in America. I don't think it's fair because she has other responsibilities and might be taking her frustrations out on us. I do love her and understand her struggles, but I feel like our family should come first.
I feel like my mom is never satisfied with me unless I'm exactly like her. She's always worried and wants everything to be perfect. I just wish she would be more open-minded with me. If I don't act like her, I feel like I'm not good enough and something is wrong with me.
I'm worried that if I don't do things the same way as my mother, I won't be respected in the community and people will talk about me negatively.
I am really frustrated with my family, especially my mom. She always wants us to sit down and have family discussions about everything. I have told them that I am not happy with the way they treat me, and I can't help but feel like my brother is better than me. Why can't they just relax and stop being dictators?
I can't go away to school someday, and what concerns me more is that I always hear my parents arguing. They're constantly arguing, and my mom says weird things when she's upset. But I know she loves me and everything. She is good to us, doesn't deprive us of anything, and we're happy. I always have money and a phone.
I just heard my mom say things like, 'Do you wanna go get married?' or 'Do you want me to send you back and get you married?' It scares me, and I don't know if she really would do it. It's scary, and I don't want to get married. Why would I want to get married? I'm only 15.
I'm worried about my friend because she's been making some concerning statements to get my attention. She seems really frustrated with what's going on in her life, and I'm not sure what to do or say to help her. I've seen other friends in my neighborhood whose parents tell them similar things, and I'm afraid she might actually take some drastic action.
I successfully completed a task that I was initially afraid of. I took a statistics test, which has always been challenging for me as I am not good at math. However, I passed and I am very proud of myself.
I felt happiness and a sense of success after passing a test that I previously didn't think I would be able to do. However, it's still difficult for me to accept this success.
As a patient, I feel really good about my success and associate it with a feeling of accomplishment.
I've been attending a support group for the past couple of months after my grandfather's illness. It was a difficult time, but thanks to the support group, I started to feel better. They even asked me to take a leadership role in the group, which is exciting for me. I used to think negatively about my own health due to my grandfather's cancer, but talking to others who've been through the same thing has made me more optimistic.
I've been feeling much better lately, and it's helped a lot. As for my family life, my grandfather is healing and his cancer has cleared, so it's all good news.
I just can't deal with it in a constructive way, I'm scared of what's going to happen to him, I'm scared of just letting the anger overtake me and it shouldn't be happening to him, I'm angry at the doctors. What do they know anyway? I have been spending a lot of time with my grandfather in the hospital and I'm doing my best to support him. His diagnosis isn't going to change, and there's an upcoming operation that I have been trying to familiarize myself with.
I recently had an operation, and although it went well, I'm still frightened about it. Fortunately, the surgeon thinks the cancer will most likely clear. I think the best way for me to cope right now is to exercise, meditate, and join a cancer support group. I've found some hospital-recommended groups that I can attend, and I believe that'll help me a lot by talking to people who have gone through similar experiences.
I've been feeling comfortable at my new church since I moved away from Miami. I didn't think I would be able to get used to a new church, but the first Sunday I attended the new church, it felt like I never left my old one. The rituals and community made me feel at home and comfortable.
I find that when I think about my church and university, I feel an overall sense of healing and calmness. My mind doesn't race and I feel relaxed, which is something I never thought I'd be able to do.
When I was a senior in high school, I wasn't sure if I was going to pursue a college education, just because my family is very traditional and Latino. But, I had a very good counselor who guided me and put things into perspective for me, which was helpful.
I recently visited my grandparents and my mom in Miami, and my relationship with my mom has improved. It feels good because we had a difficult relationship during high school.
Growing up, there was always discord between my grandparents and my mom, which affected me. However, the park was like a getaway for me. My grandfather would take me on bike rides, and it was a chance to leave the issues at home. It was a calm and tranquil atmosphere where I could feel at peace.
I just felt at peace and free. When I say those words, it feels soothing and relieving.
I experience tension around my chest, and sometimes I think about a local park from my past when I'm in situations of tension, like in graduate school. This conversation has helped me put it into perspective, but I didn't realize how much I think about it.
I was raised by my grandparents, who are very traditional and conservative. They don't have open-minded views about women pursuing higher education, but they've always supported my decisions and have been a great strength and support to me. I lived with them until I was 21 and decided to go to graduate school.
I have been living with my grandparents since I was about five or six years old. I moved back and forth between my mother's home, but they have always been my main support system. They are conservative, but I know I can always count on them.
I was trying to remember my childhood times spent at the local park, which was right across the street from my grandparents' house. Those memories made me feel good, especially thinking about the time when my grandfather was more energetic and we used to go on bike rides together. The park was so tranquil and I felt happy thinking about its serenity.
My grandmother was always cooking, she was always in the kitchen, cooking meals for us and that's what would really bring her happiness. So, when I think about her, I feel happiness in my heart.
Every time I smell fresh bread, it reminds me of my grandmother and brings me joy. The church is also important to me as it was a safe haven when I needed to pray or get away from it all. I remember the incense burning and how it brought me healing.
It just helped me, put a lot of, I guess things about myself into perspective, just even now, as we were talking about it. When you mentioned strength, and you saw me wrinkle my nose, I, I couldn't except that success and strength that comes hand in hand with that. So, uhm, it's almost like an epiphany for me, so I'm grateful for that.
I just got off the phone with my grandmother and she told me that my grandfather's been recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. I'm not really worried about it, because it can't be real, I know that's not true. But lately, I haven't been dealing with it too well. Every time I think about it, I just get so scared and angry, I don't understand why me, why does it have to happen to me, when he's such an important person in my life.
Lately, I've been feeling so angry and it's scaring me. I don't know why I'm getting this angry, but I'm afraid I might hurt someone or myself.
Lately, I've been struggling with feeling accomplished and successful in my life. I feel like I need help in demonstrating my capabilities and realizing my true potential.
I've been feeling enabled lately, like I can accomplish things. I think I'm persistent, and that's part of success. I also have perseverance and strength for taking exams.
I was able to move away from a difficult situation and now I'm feeling accomplished and successful, which is very important to me. I find my strength in my mind.
I think about my community genogram, and I feel like I had a good foundation growing up. However, sometimes I question what if things had been different.
I often find myself going back to the memories of the calming and soothing time I spent with my grandfather in the park. When I am in places of tension like an exam or in a conflict with someone, I try to recall that feeling and take a deep breath to relax.
I've learned from research that positive emotions are located in the cortex and thinking about positive things, like my local park and grandfather, can help me deal with negative situations. It's not just a cognitive issue, but also physical and emotional. I remember my grandparents' courage when I think about being with them, but I need to work on creating a stronger visual image.
I'm having trouble coping with my job. The hours I'm working are supposed to be 8:30 to 3:30, but lately, I've just got so much work given to me. I work in a doctor's surgery and one doctor employed me, but there are four within the practice.
I am feeling overwhelmed because I have four people giving me work when I should only be doing work for one person. I can't fit it all into the time I am employed to work, and I don't know how to say no to them. The work just keeps piling up in my in-tray and not getting to my out-tray.
I feel really stressed about my current situation and I don't know what to do.
I thought I would only be doing your work, but I'm getting too much work from the other doctors because there are four here. I don't like dubbing anyone in, but I can't fit in all the work within the hours I'm supposed to leave.
I recently did a role play to prepare for seeing my doctor, Mary Ann, and I feel a bit better about the upcoming visit. However, I'm still nervous about the conversation. Should I practice more at home before my appointment?
I am planning to talk to someone about an issue, and I want to find the right words and time to approach them. I think I can start by asking if it's a good time to talk.
I've been struggling with approaching my boss to discuss a problem at work. Whenever I think about the conversation, I feel anxious and unsure of myself. Can you help me work through this?
I'm having problems coping with my work load at the moment. Mainly because it's putting me here too late in the afternoon. Remember when you first put me on and my hours were 8:30 to 3:30?
I've been finishing work later and later, like 4:30 or 5:00, because I have too much work to do. I want to finish on time to pick up my boys from school, and I'm wondering if we can work out something.
I don't like confrontation and telling people what to do. I feel like I need help with finding the right words and gaining confidence.
I feel a little bit more relaxed thinking about it actually. Thanks for that.
I'm worried about the impact of living closer to our families on the relationships between my parents, my in-laws, my husband, and our adopted children. I don't want the children to feel different, and I want to maintain harmonious relationships with everyone. I'm finding it hard to anticipate all the possible challenges that might arise, which makes me more afraid.
I feel comfortable in this interview with Larry because he's allowing me to express myself, which is what I came for. I don't know if there's one answer to my situation, or else I would have already taken action. Over the years, we've maintained a decent relationship despite the circumstances, and he's helping me address my fears about what might happen.
I am Kathy, and my husband and I have three children, two of whom are adopted from different races. We are about to move back to our hometown, where our parents live. They opposed the adoptions and have learned to tolerate us over the years. I am worried about how to handle the relationship with our parents while living next door, as I fear our children might be treated differently, especially now that they are in their early teens.
I feel really fearful about the relationship with our parents as they treat our adopted children differently than their biological grandchildren. I'm worried that it won't be a peaceful relationship anymore.
As a patient, I realized that there aren't many white males in my critical Mental Health Program as a graduate student. It's an interesting observation, and I hadn't really thought about it before.
This past week, I had an argument with my boyfriend. We're currently planning things out in order to move out together, but I find myself getting so frustrated at times with him. The argument was about finances, and I'm already going against my parents' wishes to move out. I want to make sure we're financially responsible during this transition and I know how much I can contribute.
I feel like my partner isn't doing enough to contribute to our plan of moving out of our parents' homes and living together. I think if we're in the same place when it's time to move out, I wouldn't feel comfortable because I know we won't be able to afford it with his current part-time job.
I haven't really tried any coping mechanisms for anxiety because I'm used to it happening. Sometimes, it goes away after a while but it also causes sleep problems, eating issues, and fights with my boyfriend.
I'm uncomfortable hearing about all this stuff and I know my anxiety is a problem, but I'm not sure how to progress or try something new.
I'm having a hard time accepting that this situation is real. I feel like if it's not real, then I don't have to deal with it. I think that's what's causing my pushback when my boyfriend and parents talk to me about my anxiety and struggles.
I am feeling overwhelmed because I have so much to deal with already, like several papers, presentations, and my family issues. Now it's like I have to deal with even more problems.
I'm struggling with wanting my partner to be a strong, protective male figure while also wanting an egalitarian relationship. I've taken some risks and I want to make sure we'll be okay together, but I also experience frustration because of this conflict.
I had this presentation last week, and I felt so sick to my stomach. I also realized I need to learn how to navigate my emotions and communicate them better with my partner.
I hate going up in front of the class and I'm always so self-critical. I question myself and constantly wonder what others are thinking about me, especially when I say something wrong. I feel like this anxiety is just part of the graduate school experience. However, it's also affecting my relationships with my boyfriend and family.
I recently came across a situation where I felt excluded due to my gender and race. It seemed like only white males were taken into consideration, and I don't fit into those traits.
I feel like I'm not an ideal graduate student because I am not white and male, and these are the only two things I cannot control.
I feel like I don't belong in my graduate school classroom because I'm a person of color and didn't grow up with the idea of college. Most of the environments I've been in are predominantly white.
Sometimes when I'm in class, I feel like, 'What am I doing here?' But when I take a step back and think about it, I have worked really hard to be here. I didn't get any special treatment or gifts to be in this position.
I am feeling conflicted because I am determined to take the next step in my relationship by moving in with my partner, even though my parents are not comfortable with it. They've sacrificed a lot for me, and it's putting me in a difficult position. It also took me a long time to reach this decision.
I saw how my parents responded to my sibling's decision, and they felt betrayed and hurt. This experience kept me from even exploring the idea of doing something similar, as I have always been the 'good child'.
I don't want to be the bad child. Watching my sister go through that experience was kind of like... I feel like we both need our space, for ourselves.
I feel limited in my social life because when my friends and I want to hang out casually, it always has to be at one of our family homes due to certain boundaries we need to respect.
I have never felt this apprehension before. When I first met my counsellor, I was worried if she would dismiss my problems because she is older than me. It has been my experience in the past. Now, even though we've been working together for a while, the age difference is coming up again because I've heard about it recently.
I recently saw a therapist, and I felt like he was dismissive of my issues. He even said, 'no offense, but…' which I found offensive. I worry that other therapists, like you, might be thinking my problems are just 'baby stuff', even if you don't say it outright.
I feel angry, he knows that I feel angry but I'm not gonna tell him that I'm angry. It doesn't seem helpful. I recently had this frustrating situation in group supervision. A guy started talking about how 20-year-olds don't have real problems and I found that very condescending.
I feel like my problems aren't taken seriously by others because of my age. I'm dealing with real issues, but often it feels like people, including you, might not understand or dismiss me due to the generational differences. I haven't brought it up before because I'm worried you might be the same way.
My week was okay, but I'm feeling stressed because my boyfriend and I have decided to move in together, and my parents won't approve. They believe one should be married before leaving the house, but I don't agree.
I am nervous about how my decision will affect my relationship with my parents, as they have sacrificed a lot for me. I think there might be resentment from them because I'm not following their rules or values, and I feel guilt for not being appreciative of everything they've done for me.
I feel like my actions are comparable to slapping my parents in the face, but I would never actually do that.
I think there have been times where you challenged me, but overall, I feel like you're not treating me as the expert of my own story. I would be uncomfortable bringing up that I feel dismissed, but I see the value in doing it.
I feel calm. I feel good about it.
I am afraid to confront my partner about how their actions of constantly going out with friends make me angry, and it's affecting our plans to move in together. I feel like I'm holding in these feelings, and it's causing me to be angry all the time, which is negatively affecting other areas of my life.
I don't know, I feel kind of pissed off when talking about this issue. I'm worried about people's reactions when they see me angry and the possible consequences. I've been with my boyfriend for four years, and although I try to pretend to be nice on the phone when I'm angry, he probably knows.
I have a close friend who knows me better than anyone else, but sometimes he makes comments that really bother me. I haven't directly expressed my feelings about it because it's scary to confront him.
I haven't jumped on the bed for so long, and now I'm about to do it. But I feel a sense of dread and uncertainty.
I feel uncomfortable and not good at confrontation. I don't know if I'll ever be totally comfortable in these conversations. What would be helpful for me?
Last week, I committed to having a tough conversation with someone. I decided to go through with it, and I'm working on what this conversation might look like. Can we discuss it further?
This past week has been a bit difficult for me. I've talked about it a little bit in here about how I have a lot of self-doubt sometimes in my graduate program and not really feeling like I, er, earned the right to be here. We were having a presentation in class and, um, it wasn't my presentation. So I was just sitting there watching.
I can't cross at my parent's home. My parents are very strict about that, even the way we sit next to each other. I feel sick of having my relationship managed by them, but I believe this is the right move for me.
I am worried about how my parents will react when I tell them about a decision I've made that they might not agree with. I feel anxious about their reaction and want to find a better way to approach them. I don't think my sister did a good job when she told them she was moving out, and I want to avoid making the same mistake.
I've recently made a big decision in my life and now I'm facing the challenge of how to approach my parents about it. I've struggled for a while to come to this conclusion, and I'm currently dealing with feelings of uncertainty and fear.
Lately, I've been feeling guilty about moving in with my boyfriend because it feels like I'm doing something forbidden, like when I was a child and wasn't supposed to jump on the bed. I've always been the good child in my family, and I fear becoming the bad child.
I have been pretending to be okay with my boyfriend spending more time with other people than with me. I feel like I'm being fake, and I'm really angry about it. He probably knows I'm angry from my tone of voice, but he continues to do it anyway.
I have been trying to communicate with my partner about something that bothers me. He continues doing it despite me telling him that I don't like it. I find myself getting angry and trying to be sarcastically nice on the phone instead of telling him how I really feel. I think it's because I don't want to let him know how upset I am.
I'm having trouble communicating my anger directly to someone. I don't know what will happen if I do that. We're in a tricky transition period right now, making big decisions about our future, and I'm worried about how he might react.
As a patient, I am worried about the age difference between us and the possible issues it could cause during our sessions. I recently mentioned this to the counsellor, but now I feel more open about it. I haven’t felt like the counsellor has been dismissive, but I’m not sure if I'd be comfortable bringing up any generational misunderstandings in the future.
I'm feeling a kind of unspoken anger in our relationship, and I'm not sure how to address it, or how you would react if I bring it up.
I like the idea of me being the expert because I can't say that I feel that very often. So, there's something that feels good about that.
I had another argument with my boyfriend because he's going out with his friends and staying out late at night. I can't remember the last time we went out. He sees them so often, and I don't really like the people he's hanging out with. I feel like I'm being put to the side and it bothers me that he could be spending that time with me.
I have been noticing that my partner has been spending more and more time with his friends. Our last argument was over the phone, where he just told me he was going to hang out with his friends without asking if it was okay with me. This has become a common occurrence and it makes me feel really upset.
Lately, I've been feeling like I'm pretending to be okay with everything, but deep down, I'm not really feeling better about the situation.
I'm struggling with the expectations I have for my boyfriend in our relationship because I don't want to move into a patriarchal type of relationship, but I still find myself having expectations of him. I want us to have equality in our relationship, but I get frustrated when he's not contributing more than I am. I think my feelings are influenced by my relationship with my dad, who was more autocratic.
I feel frustrated about having expectations for my boyfriend to be a provider and protector like my dad, but I don't want him to be too controlling. I haven't communicated this well, and I think there might be some anxiety about leaving my parents' house and making things work financially.
I am frustrated with my partner because he continues with a part-time job that sometimes flakes on the hours, and I feel like he's letting me down. I expect him to do more, and I feel like if it were me, I would jump right in and fill out job applications.
I got into an argument with my boyfriend when I tried to share job postings with him. I think I'm comparing him to my dad, who has always been the provider for our family and allowed my mom to stay home with us. I feel like I'm expecting my boyfriend to live up to that standard, and I get disappointed when he doesn't.
I'm struggling with comparing my father's strong role in the family to my boyfriend, who is still learning his role as we move in together. My father came from Mexico and had a strong sense of responsibility, taking care of the family, providing, and valuing family. This is causing friction in my relationship.
I shared my feedback during a class and thought I had a great answer, but my professor disagreed. At that moment, I felt self-doubt and uncomfortable. It seemed like I was deflated because I thought I was contributing.
I feel like I didn't fulfill my role as a graduate student because Graduate School is about learning and contributing, creating knowledge, but in that moment, I didn't do any of those things.
As a patient, I tried to follow your instruction to share whatever comes to my mind without stopping myself or censoring myself as you asked. I was preparing to go back to that classroom setting and share what comes to my mind.
As a graduate student, I sometimes struggle with the pressure of being a creator of knowledge, being responsible, and having a passion for learning. I feel like I am filtering through a lot of expectations.
I always seem to move my problems to the back of my mind, but they're always right at the forefront of my experiences. It feels like something is wrong with me. I'm struggling with these issues, but I prefer to think of it as a problem to deal with rather than a personal flaw.
I've been resistant to looking at this problem I'm struggling with because I don't want to deal with it. It's painful and uncomfortable. I've tried for so long to convince myself that it's not a real issue.
I realized that maybe I do have to deal with this issue, and it feels scary, uncomfortable, but also kind of like, let's just do it.
I've been avoiding dealing with a serious issue that's affecting my life because it's uncomfortable and scary. Now we're opening up this box that I haven't wanted to deal with.
I'm on probation and I need to submit a letter to them about undergoing counselling. I really want to get off probation and stay out of jail.
I'm on probation and I really want to get off from it. It's affecting my life and I am willing to do what it takes.
I don't remember the whole situation well, but I tried to do her a favor and wanted to talk to her, even though she showed no interest. It got worse, and eventually, I got her in my car, so I could have a conversation. She didn't want to be in the car with me, but after she listened to me, everything was fine. However, her mom called the police, and I was arrested for kidnapping when I got back to the house.
I did some time and now I am on probation. When I was in the car with my partner, I was probably yelling at her, but I don't really remember too much because I was pretty mad.
I was yelling at my partner, asking why she doesn't listen to me. I accused her of sleeping around and might have called her a few bad names.
I don't have an anger problem, but they're trying to tell me I have one. There was a problem with my ex-girlfriend a long time ago, and the court sent me to anger management. Everyone in my neighborhood says I'm a great guy, and I don't have a problem. I found out I got gonorrhea from my ex-girlfriend, and I was just trying to tell her to get checked out, but she and her mom were disrespectful towards me.
I was upset that I got gonorrhea from her, but it wasn't a big problem since it could be treated with pills. However, I was concerned about where she got it from and wanted her to get checked. I wasn't angry about the possibility of her being with someone else, but I needed to talk to her about the issue since she wasn't picking up her phone.
I've recently spent 30 days in jail and it was a really tough time for me. During that time, I lost my job, got behind on car payments, and had problems with my family and girlfriend. Now I'm on probation and I feel like I need to control my anger to keep me out of jail. I don't want my life to fall apart like it did while I was in jail.
I have trouble controlling my anger because I feel like it's the only way to get respect from people. Sometimes, when I think someone's about to say something offensive to me, I just swing at them without thinking. It's a big reason for my behavior, and it sometimes gets me what I want, but I also end up getting hurt in the process.
As a patient, I feel that sometimes I get the respect I deserve, but other times I don't feel like I completely got what I wanted out of a situation.
I was probably pretty angry. I mean, I don't really remember, though. At that point, when I'm driving the car, probably 70 or 80, I guess. I called her names, but I didn't touch her that time.
I was with a girl one time and we got back to my place. She said she was going to go to the doctor, and everything seemed resolved, but the police were there and I got arrested. I was charged with kidnapping and some other stuff, and I ended up serving some time.
I did 30 days in jail and it was terrible. You don't want to be in jail. It's all about fighting, so you have to fight the whole time you're there or else you'll get beaten up.
I was in jail before, and it was a horrible experience. I really don't want to go back there, so now I try not to let anything bother me. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the most important, not going back to jail is a 12 for me.
I've been forced to come here to stay out of jail. I guess I still have some anger issues, and I want to get along with women better without hitting them like I did in the past.
I feel like sometimes I don't have a choice and I can end up in jail again. I've been forced to come to these meetings. I think I might show up but money can be tricky for me, so can I pay every two or three weeks when I get a paycheck?
I sometimes get really angry, and little misunderstandings become big fights. This has led to me throwing punches, getting my face busted up, and even getting arrested. I want to avoid going back to jail.
I'm worried that if I don't change my anger issues, I might end up going back to jail or getting into a dangerous situation. I've been sent here, but I feel like I don't have any anger now and I'm calm.
Since I got out of jail, I've decided I don't want to go back there. My life is pretty good now, I don't talk to that girl anymore and other females in my life. People say I'm a cool, calm guy now, unlike before where I'd be the first to engage in a fight.
I've been trying to stay calm and out of jail, but it hasn't been easy for me. I know I need help, but sometimes I feel like I'm not making progress.
I'm feeling isolated and it's affecting my search for success. The idea of isolation sounds a little scary to me.
I'm Suzie, and I'm worried about never finding a perfect partner. It's a depressing thought and I don't even want to think about it. I like to believe it is possible, but I might just shrivel up and die if it doesn't happen.
I feel like my fear of being alone and isolated is causing me problems. Sometimes I think once I meet a man, all my problems will go away, but it never turns out that way.
I haven't found the right partner yet and I always feel a bit lonely and unhappy even when I'm in a relationship.
I really like my job and everyone at work, but my mother thinks I need to go out more and lose weight to find a partner and have children. She wants to know all about my social life, but I find it difficult to talk to her about it, especially on Fridays. I've gained 20 pounds since I lost 30 pounds.
I used to be heavy in high school, but I lost 30 pounds at some point. However, I'm currently 10 pounds below my heaviest weight and still within the weight range as per the charts. I am worried if I have an eating disorder, but I don't know why everyone keeps thinking that.
I'm not anorexic, and I'm not obese. I have similar reading patterns as everyone else. I feel lonely and isolated sometimes. I don't go out very often, especially with people from work. My mother doesn't understand why I prefer to stay at home.
I've been struggling with my eating habits. On holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, I tend to binge eat, and I also used to drink a lot by myself. I've started trying to balance my diet and not restrict my eating, but it still doesn't feel healthy, and my eating patterns often involve bingeing on weekends and then restricting during the week.
I've been trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle with a well-rounded diet and regular exercise, but sometimes I go a bit overboard on portion sizes and feel guilty afterwards.
I love my job, but on weekends I feel lonely. I tend to reward myself with donuts to not feel the loneliness when I'm at home.
I just like being home and I like being able to do whatever I want to and eat the foods I want to and I like the way they taste. Also, I believe if I lost more weight, the guys would date me. Don't you agree with that?
I was never really anorexic like others who weigh 82 pounds and get hospitalized. However, I did lose 30 pounds in a span of 2 to 3 months by heavily restricting my diet during high school.
I grew up in a very tidy family, and we didn't have any pets because they might make a mess. Sometimes there would be a mess, and my mom would get very upset. She would tell me how important it was for things to have order and to be in their place.
As a child, I felt responsible for keeping my home calm because upsetting my mom would create consequences. I would try to keep things calm and in their proper place because my home environment was very calm.
I feel like my mom's anxiety is affecting me. She would get really anxious when things were not in place, and it's to the point where I can feel it too. There's no yelling or anything, just a lot of tension around her.
I want to let you know that I feel like I have some eating disorder behaviors, but not necessarily a formal eating disorder. I'm hoping you can help me with this.
I found out that my mother called my doctor, Dr. White, and expressed her concern that I have some sort of eating disorder problem. The doctor informed me about this.
I recently received a call from a friend who told me to seek help because she thinks I have an eating disorder. She believes I have unhealthy eating habits, don't exercise enough, and overeat. I don't think I have an eating disorder, but I am open to discussing any eating problems I might have.
I don't think I have an eating disorder; that's just my mother's opinion. I'm here to please my mother and get her off my back. Life is going okay, but I believe everyone could be happier.
I have been feeling like I mean nothing compared to everyone else. I am an only child, and my parents are still alive and married. They are my biological parents as well.
Lately, I've been struggling with feelings of anxiety and stress. I constantly worry about things that might happen, and it's affecting my daily life. I have trouble sleeping, and I'm always on edge. I don't know what to do about it.
I tend to have negative thoughts and beliefs about myself, often resulting in feelings of loneliness. I joke about finding a partner who would stay home and eat Krispy Kremes with me.
I'm seeking help because I'm struggling with an eating disorder and I'm unsure of how to deal with it on my own. I'm wondering how my past experiences and my family environment might have contributed to this issue.
As a child, I experienced a lack of affection in my family, especially between my parents. My father could occasionally joke and tease a bit, but it was never really boisterous.
I remember my family's interactions mostly involved verbal teasing and not much touching. My mom seemed to show anxiety, but there weren't any big demonstrations of feelings like anger, laughter or sadness.
When I was little, like around 5, 8, 10, 12 years old, I remember feeling a bit lonely. I didn't have any siblings and there weren't many kids that would come over to our house because it would get messy, so I didn't have a lot of friends coming over. My childhood was not bad or abusive, but it was just kind of lacking in fun and a bit isolating.
I don't think I was sad, but I felt a bit lonely. I used to spend most of my time alone in my room, drawing and reading.
Lately, I've been feeling anxious and I think it's due to my mother's anxiety. She tends to get overwhelmed, and I believe that her anxiety is affecting me. I'm just looking for some guidance to help me get back to my normal state.
It was a calm environment at home when everything was orderly and okay. My mom expressed affection by carrying out her roles as a mother, housekeeper, and homemaker, keeping the house clean and cooking meals.
I feel like my mom showed her love by doing things like cleaning the house and taking care of us, but we didn't have much physical affection like hugging, cuddling, or snuggling. I don't remember her reading to me at bedtime, but I'm sure she did because all parents do that.
I don't like to talk about this, but I'm afraid that my partner secretly agrees with my belief that unless I'm skinny, I'm not attractive or worthy enough. I think all guys think that way and I believe my partner should love me regardless of my weight.
I just kind of felt like there is always going to be the other side of him that would come out and tell me why he couldn’t be with me. I'm also experiencing an eating disorder and feeling lonely and not very happy, especially on the weekends.
I tend to eat a lot of calories from sweets and cakes on weekends, like Krispy Kremes, which makes me less hungry for the next few days. This leads me to eat closer to a balanced diet around Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. However, on Sundays, I might still consume more sweets, and on Mondays, my diet might consist of something as minimal as just one apple.
I've been trying to eat less because I'm not hungry. I feel like on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I go back to a more normal and balanced diet. But I'm not sure if eating the same pattern on weekends is a good thing.
I feel like my diet is balanced during weekdays, but on the weekends, I tend to reward myself for the hard work I did throughout the week.
I had a long week of working, so I decided to stay home and watch a movie to unwind. I caught up on laundry and did some yard work. I don't really indulge in food treats like popcorn while watching a movie.
I usually get a variety of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and eat them while I watch a movie on Friday nights. Sometimes, I watch a movie on Saturday nights as well.
Sometimes, I eat a lot, like two boxes of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. But I try to balance it out by eating less the next day or during the week if I splurge on the weekend.
I don't know why, but back in high school, when I was losing weight, I used to eat just an apple some days. After an indulgent weekend, I am not really hungry and on Mondays, I might just have a piece of bread for the whole day.
I didn't really enjoy high school like most people. My grades were good, but I didn't have many good friends and felt somewhat isolated.
I lost about 30 pounds during the summer break before my senior year of high school, and I started getting attention from guys. I didn't really fit in before, and I used to eat very little, sometimes just an apple in a day.
I started dieting this summer because I was about 30 pounds overweight. Once I lost the weight, I noticed that I started getting more attention from people.
As a patient, I want to share that I did a lot of dating during my high school years, particularly in my senior year.
I've been facing some eating disorder problems, but it's not full anorexia or bulimia. However, I do well at my job and can connect with customers and people. My personal life's not going so well though. My friends try to set me up, and my mother thought I was engaged before, which I was.
I was in a relationship for about a year and a half, and we broke up two years ago. We were actually formally engaged during that time. I don't date much, though.
I have experienced depression in the past, around 1988 or 1989.
I went through a period of depression, but I didn't take any medications for it. There's no history of family violence, sexual abuse, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal behaviors in my family.
I am currently involved in litigation and I have recently experienced a significant loss.
I am a married mother to an 11-month-old baby and recently lost a dear family friend unexpectedly. I've been married for almost five years. I am not sure how to cope with my grief and the challenges of taking care of my baby.
I am overwhelmed with all of the scheduling and hiring for assistants. I do all the hiring by myself, not as a couple.
I'm a new mom and I'm feeling overwhelmed with all the scheduling, hiring people to help with the baby, and setting limits with the childcare provider to ensure they know I'm the mother and not them.
I had therapy in 1989 and lately, I've been experiencing a little anxiety and nervousness, but no depression.
As a patient, I haven't been experiencing any problems with my sleep apart from the typical issues that a mother faces. I don't have any intrusive or obsessive thoughts, and I’m not showing any compulsive behaviors. Additionally, I don't suffer from confusion or memory difficulties.
I've been struggling with not getting enough time to eat lately. I don't have any marital, family, sexual, or alcohol-related problems. I just can't seem to find the time to eat properly.
I am feeling overwhelmed with everything and having problems with certain assistants. I constantly have to remind them to follow the routine, and it's been two months already. I expected them to know the routine by now.
I feel comfortable in the session, but I am concerned about the accessibility of the bathroom and where my assistant can wait in the future. I left my assistant in the car this time. Is there a place that she could wait inside?
I'm feeling overwhelmed because I have to manage hiring, training, supervision, and firing of assistants for my job. Additionally, I also work two jobs, including a full-time position working with teenagers in residential treatment. Recently, I had to fire someone because they weren't doing the job right and broke confidentiality. I've since hired new people but I'm having trouble managing everything.
I was on maternity leave and had time to train my assistants. But now I am back to work, and I can't train them anymore. Also, when my baby cries, I want them to bring her to me so I can take care of her emotional needs and not get involved themselves.
I feel frustrated because my family isn't listening to my requests when it comes to taking care of my child. I try to communicate my needs, but I think part of the problem is that when I'm not home, they have to switch roles. So, when I come home, I want them to help me be more involved in my child's life, but they don't seem to understand.
I have been feeling depressed with my mind constantly racing. I wonder if my pregnancy could explain some of these unusual feelings, but at times, I also think there's something wrong with me. I noticed some changes after taking medication.
Ever since I was in the hospital, had therapy, and took medicine, I came back to a so-called normal place and I think maybe I am bipolar. But, it's not how I define myself or how I want to define myself.
I'm struggling with the feeling of not knowing if I am productive or not. There's a part of me that doesn't want to let go of having a lot of ideas and going through with them all the time. I don't like feeling like a zombie.
As a patient, I was recently diagnosed as bipolar and it has affected me somewhat, although the label itself doesn't bother me as much as what a psychiatrist told me. They said that I would have to take medication for the rest of my life, which I found unsettling.
I've been attending counseling sessions, despite my family's lack of support. Initially, I wasn't keen on the idea, but talking about my issues seems to help. It's surprising that I feel comfortable discussing my problems with a male counselor since I usually don't interact much with men. I thought we would focus more on my drinking habit.
I thought I'd come in and say, look I'm drinking three glasses of wine a week. And I thought you would say, alright, how can we cut down to two? And then how can we cut down to one, or else is three a problem?
I'm a single working mom going to college and I love writing poetry. Lately, I've been feeling guilty for taking time for myself for writing poetry, going to the gym, or doing other activities that I enjoy. I feel like I just shouldn't have time to do these things.
I've had times where I write or read before bed and it sometimes helps me sleep or keeps me up all night depending on the book. I don't do it enough, but I think I could use it more like if the alarm went off, I could stop and write some stuff down. I usually just do it randomly when I'm inspired to.
I'm trying this new approach with counseling because I've been feeling overwhelmed, and I don't want to keep everything bottled up inside but also don't want to end up in a hospital.
I feel overwhelmed with all the tasks I need to complete, and I'm worried that I might end up being paranoid, hearing voices, or seeing things.
I've been trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle to avoid mental health issues. One of my previous counselors told me to stay away from drugs, exercise regularly, avoid alcohol, and even try natural remedies like teas and baths. But I'm still struggling with some areas, like staying away from wine.
I've been trying to manage my emotions with alternative treatments like teas and baths, but I'm scared that I'm starting to rely more on wine. My family approves of the alternative methods, but not the alcohol. When I was pregnant, my family said that my emotional issues were just due to hormonal changes.
I recently discovered that some women have hallucinations when they're pregnant, which has me feeling worried. I'm also dealing with the fact that the guy I was dating left me after finding out I'm pregnant, and I'm feeling very depressed. I'm only 18 and being undocumented is putting added pressure on me, as I can't do what my peers are doing or meet the lifestyle milestones I feel I should be.
I find it kind of funny, but in my home, my family accepts something that is not generally accepted here in the States. It's a secret that we don't share with anyone else.
I find it strange to navigate between family expectations, especially concerning traditional gender roles like being a mother, daughter, and wife, and handling a mental health issue. I am willing to discuss both topics, but I'd like to start with talking about what it's like to be a woman and fulfilling these expectations.
As the oldest sibling, I was allowed to be a tomboy a bit, but I was never allowed to play soccer because girls don't play soccer. I fought hard for my dad to let me play basketball, which I love. However, when I reached high school, I was told that I couldn't play basketball anymore since I'm becoming a young lady.
I never really thought about my limited personal time being precious. At night, when I should be asleep, I have the option to do things for myself like answering emails, having a glass of wine, or reading. But I often just have a glass of wine instead because I feel guilty for not going to sleep, so I can be prepared for tomorrow's responsibilities like school work and taking care of my son.
I never realized it before, but I do feel guilty when I have time to myself. I feel like I have so much to do and so many responsibilities that I shouldn't have alone time. My mom never had any alone time either.
I've noticed that my mother, grandmother, and other family members who were focused on their children and husbands were considered 'good mothers.' However, my aunts, who were not married and had time for themselves, were labeled as 'spinsters' or 'old maids' because they didn't devote themselves to a family. I think this is a cultural expectation.
You know, excuse me, it's bullshit, you know, what're you… you need the counselor, you know, do your work. Go to work. Go to church on Sunday you will be fine, you know, what do they know. Umm… And I did feel that way… two years ago when this whole process started.
I started taking the prescribed medication, and after a few sessions, I felt better and more adjusted. As immigrants, my family always worked hard, and I juggled both work and school. But, at times, I feel out of place when I see other students driving to school.
I feel like I have a lot on my plate compared to my peers who just go to class, get high, and do homework. My father might not view counseling as a great option. We immigrated from Colombia, and I wonder if that has something to do with his views on counseling.
I am an immigrant, and my father came here first undocumented. He later brought my sister, my mom, and me over. He worked three jobs to raise the money to get us here, and my mother always worked as well. They did all this so that we would be able to receive an education and move beyond our struggles.
As a patient, I feel that succeeding in school is extremely important to me.
I'm feeling a bit nervous about handling all my responsibilities, as I'm the oldest in my family, the first one in college, and my father expects me to cook, clean and take care of my son. I don't have many people to talk to about these things.
I am constantly thinking about the gender roles in my family, but it's pointless. My mom will always serve my dad and he will never change his view on what women are supposed to do. Sometimes I fight my dad on it and other times I just let it go, but it still makes me angry.
I'm feeling better than last time, but I'm still angry and frustrated about my father's behavior. I've realized that it's a part of who he is and recently learned the term 'maranismo' to describe it. I don't want to be in a relationship with someone like that or raise my son that way.
I feel so frustrated because I can't change my family member, even though I know it's not possible for me to control others.
I used to be always on the defensive during therapy sessions, ready to leave if the conversation veered off in another direction. But with you, I felt like you were going to accept and understand what I was trying to say.
I was surprised when I heard you say the words back at me, and I realized that I am pissed off. I hadn't allowed myself to be angry before, but having someone notice, acknowledge, and accept my feelings feels good. I don't necessarily want to do anything about my anger, but I just wanted to say that I am, and it's okay.
Since our last session, I've tried to make some changes in my life. I've set an alarm at night to prevent staying up too late, and that's helped me balance work, being a mom, and doing my homework. Things are a little better now, but sometimes my son wakes up in the middle of the night.
I’m still feeling scared, especially with finals coming up.
I’ve been trying really hard to focus on school and balance my life. I go to school in the morning, work in the afternoon, take care of my son, and then stay up doing my homework and studying. It's hard to fall asleep, so I started drinking a glass of wine, which has now increased to two or three. I’m getting nervous that my past struggles as an undocumented student will resurface with all the stress.
I felt like a loser and started getting depressed and down with myself. There was really nothing to do, so I started hanging out with different people and experimenting with drugs. This kind of depression turned into a mania, and I ended up in the hospital where they diagnosed me as bipolar.
I learned that not being able to sleep is one of the symptoms of my problem. I can't afford to be sick, as I'm finally in school, which is what I wanted, and I have my son. I think starting counseling now might help me figure out how to deal with it.
I'm worried that my situation might get worse and may lead me to be hospitalized again. My father doesn't think counseling is a good idea, but I decided to seek help anyway. I have a lot of stressors in my life, including taking care of my son.
I feel guilty about thinking about myself despite being busy with school, work, and other activities. My mom would probably feel the same way. It's a strange feeling and I feel stupid for feeling this way. My head and heart often fight with each other about this issue.
I feel like it's stupid to fight against the expectations from my family and culture because it's what I know and what everyone else expects of me. However, sometimes I wonder if other women my age who are in college and have kids feel the same way, but I don't see a lot of Latinos in college and it makes me feel isolated.
I've been staying up till 2 am and consuming half a bottle of wine. When I do my homework and go to bed earlier, I might have only one glass or none at all. The next day, I feel guilty about having one too many glasses of wine and I know it's not what I want to do. After talking to you, I've become more aware of my actions.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed. My day starts at 6am and it's non-stop work - even during lunch. My two-year-old son also keeps me busy throughout the day. By the end of the day, after finishing dinner, putting my son to bed, and completing my homework, I feel like grabbing a glass of wine to relax.
I feel like I can't stop doing things on my own. A glass of wine helps me like an emergency brake, allowing me to completely stop. If I don't have the wine, I'll end up doing other tasks or reading a book I've been wanting to read. Sometimes, I get stupid ideas and do things like cleaning the grout in the bathtub at 11 o'clock at night.
When you mentioned that my experience must have been really difficult, it made me feel validated. It's nice to hear someone acknowledge my feelings. Sometimes when I talk to friends about it, they don't seem to understand or validate my experience.
I felt good when you just acknowledged my feelings and didn't tell me not to do something. It felt nice to talk about things like my grandma and certain topics, knowing that I didn’t have to explain their significance in detail to you.
I've been talking to you about my family situation, and you were able to identify and understand the term 'marianismo' right away. I appreciate that you know the basic concepts related to my culture, and it makes me feel more comfortable discussing my issues with you.
I've never had a counselor or doctor who was like me or who could speak my language. There was just one Latino nurse. In previous counseling sessions, I felt like I had to defend my stance because I didn't feel comfortable.
I'm still struggling with accepting my bipolar diagnosis and I'm wondering if there might be other ways to deal with it.
Sometimes I go to my parents' house for dinner and hear them arguing. Also, my old friends from when I wasn't in school and was feeling down and doing things I shouldn't be doing sometimes show up on Thursday nights wanting to hang out, but I can't do that anymore.
I'm feeling overwhelmed lately. Even after finishing all my tasks and my body is tired, my mind keeps racing, and I can't seem to relax. I tried having a glass of wine to help me unwind, but then I need more just to feel relaxed enough to sleep.
I get drunk really easily and feel hungover after just a few drinks. My mind constantly races due to the pressures and busyness of life, and I feel guilty for thinking that it's not fair. I've never really sat down and thought about it before.
I feel like I often end up feeling sorry for myself, and then I get mad at myself for feeling that way. This is the first time I'm putting these feelings into words because I don't usually have a chance to talk about them with my friends who don't have kids.
As a patient, I feel sorry for myself sometimes. I have a lot of pressures like doing well in school, taking care of my son, and meeting family expectations as the oldest sibling. I need to hurry up and graduate, get a great job, help my parents buy a house, and set things up for my brothers and sisters.
I want to achieve success, but it feels like it's not for me, but for everyone else. It feels heavy on my shoulders, and I feel guilty because I'm in college now. There were times when we didn't have so much.
I have reached my goals and have what I want now, but my mind races all day, and I feel like all I can do is shut up, drink a glass of wine, go to sleep, and do it again tomorrow. My days are packed with making breakfast, packing lunches, and getting dressed in the mornings.
I have a really busy schedule. I drop off my child at school and then rush to attend my classes. I don't just take classes; I'm also involved in various activities like breast cancer walks. After school, I rush back to pick up my child and make dinner.
I'm feeling overwhelmed and scared that I might crash completely. Today's session has helped me, and I'm feeling a bit better now. I have voiced feelings I didn't even realize I had. I'm open to continuing with these weekly sessions.
I recently participated in a training video, and it felt very real. At times, I felt like I was right back in the situations I've experienced, and it felt good to hear someone else validate my feelings.
I've been trying to maintain more control over my emotions and establish a routine, like setting an alarm to sleep earlier. Although it's challenging, I'm motivated to continue because I don't want to feel out of control anymore, and college, my son, and my health are my top priorities.
I recently started improving my sleep schedule by going to bed earlier, around midnight instead of 2am. However, I still struggle with hitting the snooze button in the morning. I feel more motivated to change now and take control of my life, but sometimes I'm afraid of my drinking habits, where one glass of wine leads to another.
I know enough to know that it's what I'm using to calm down. It's what I'm using to go to sleep. And I don't want to get to a point where I'm depending on it. So, the alarm helps me to say, okay, well you need to start unwinding. You know with, without the wine, I'm still drinking it.
As a patient, I feel annoyed when I think about my mother's lifestyle of constantly prioritizing others' needs over her own. She seems happy living for her children and husband, but I can't help but feel that she can't be happy like that all the time.
My father says that I'm never going to be happy with a man or get married because I'm too focused on myself and too Americanized. He thinks I should serve my man and do everything my mother does. I want to take care of my family, but not to the extreme my mother does, leaving no time for myself. I feel guilty when I have alone time.
I realized that I'm not as different from my mom as I thought I was, and that really bothers me.
I have been kind of observing myself lately, and noticing how I feel and what I think about certain situations. I've been drinking wine and worrying about various things. When you asked how I felt about you, it helped me get out of my memories and focus on the present moment.
I don't know how else to say this, but I've had realizations and hot moments. The problem is, I've been drinking three glasses of wine to go to bed and suddenly you made me notice the parallel with my mom. I complain that she doesn't make time for herself, and I'm doing the same thing - devoting myself to my child and my career or education. I feel guilty if I try to get some me-time, just like her.
Lately, I have been feeling overwhelmed and I want to find ways to balance my life. I remember a counselor once suggested trying meditation. I did some research and found a type of meditation that uses beads, but I have never tried it before.
I have been using chants and counting beads, following the Buddhist meditation method, which my grandma used to do with the rosary. You know, I'm not chanting mantras, but if you ever heard of Rosario, it sings on me.
I've been dancing with two worlds and trying to find matches between them. I recognize when I'm entering a problematic space, like when my wine drinking is getting to be too much. I've listened to my instincts and decided to come to therapy to talk about it.
Two years ago, I experienced an extremely messy and hurtful situation. Even though it was awful, a part of me is glad that it happened because now I know what it looks like and feels like. Now I can be prepared and make sure it doesn't happen again. However, this has left me with some fear.
I was initially afraid to see a counselor because people would think I'm crazy, but now I feel a bit better. However, I face cultural expectations in my life, like being young and having a kid and being married, which my white friends don't understand. My Latino friends understand that I got married because I needed papers.
I feel like I'm living in two worlds because my father expects me to do well in school, but also expects me to get married and do traditional things. He praises me when I get honors, but when it comes to being involved in activities like running for President of an organization, he questions how I'll be able to find a boyfriend or keep a husband and tells me I should focus on cooking.
I always feel like I'm balancing between two different aspects of my life, and with the mental health piece, it's like in Colombia where there's always the town crazy lady, who's eccentric and dresses funny but is accepted. My family even teases me that way.
I ended up in the hospital because I was overwhelmed with feelings of sadness and anger, which affected my functioning. I started using wine as a coping mechanism to numb those emotions, but now I feel scared about this realization.
I've come to realize that if I bottle up my emotions, eventually it's going to explode, and that scares me. But at the same time, if I allow myself to feel and go through my emotions, I might end up feeling sorry for myself. I feel like I'm in a difficult situation either way.
I struggle with gender roles and feel like I'm always in this middle place. I'm afraid that if I open up about my feelings, it could lead to depression and hospitalization, but I also know that bottling up emotions isn't good for me. That's why I came to counselling.
I feel like my mind races sometimes and I never express it with my family. Two years ago, I used to be constantly jumping from one idea to another, but I was able to keep up and succeed at each thing I did.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed because I'm always working and trying to do multiple things at once, like my father who used to work three jobs. I don't know why I'm complaining about it, but I feel paranoid and strange.
I've been feeling quite down lately, but my family has been trying to support me. My grandma is praying for me with her Rosario, and my aunts often take me out and talk to me. We don't really believe in calling a counselor or taking pills, we prefer more traditional methods like herbal teas.
I didn't want to be in the hospital, hopped up on pills and zombified, which is why I stopped the counseling in the first place. The counselor was encouraging me to continue medication, but I like the way my family handles it, with baths and rest.
I can't help but feel like my life revolves around doing a hundred things in one day. When I was given medication like Risperdal and Lithium, I felt like a zombie.
I sometimes feel isolated because it seems that people around me don't understand my thoughts. I want to worry about simple things like new shoes or clothes, but I am not going to cry if I get a B+ or A- in my exams. I feel I have more important things to worry about.
Sometimes I feel like people are just whining about not having a brand new car while I have to take the bus to school. It gets annoying but I try to bring myself out of that bubble and remind myself that their situation is different from mine.
I can't fully express my emotions because I'm worried that if I start feeling too much, I'll become paralyzed by self-pity and won't be able to move forward. I think my family and I have a tendency to be dramatic, and if I allow feelings to come in, I'll be overwhelmed by anxiety, fear, self-doubt, anger, and sadness. So, I prefer to keep my emotions in a little box to continue functioning.
I feel like I can't talk to my friends or parents about my problems because I have already made a mistake with drugs in the past and now I need to show strength as the eldest child in the family.
I never really put it in line like that. I feel like this and that's why I'm drinking wine, which helps but then doesn't. I have conflicting emotions like feeling sorry for myself, feeling guilty for feeling sorry, thinking about my family, wanting to be selfish, and all these different things. It's kind of scary because I have to be focused.
I don't have room. You know, it's like there is not another chance. So, I don't want these emotions to bring me to a place where I'm depressed again or I don't want my busy day and my racing mind to bring me to bring me to a negative place. I guess that's what brought me here. It's fear. You know I... I don't want all these feelings to... to paralyze me. And umm... Even though that's feeling numb is... is sometimes a good thing.
I don't want to go to that place. It didn't feel brave at first, but you saying it now, I'm like yeah.
I was told that I will need to take pills for the rest of my life to maintain a normal level, and that thought made me cry. I think it's crazy to imagine taking pills for the rest of my life, and I still feel that way.
I've been starting and stopping therapy because I don't want to take medication. I told my family if they see me hallucinating or delusional, then they should force me to take medicine. I believe prayer, baths, and teas help me, and I'm fine now.
I'm scared about what might happen if I'm not fine. I haven't made peace with either side of my situation, and I wonder if I'm not accepting something that could really help me. Maybe I should take the pill. I have a close family that supports me and we've been trying alternative healing methods like baths and prayers.
I am the first person in my family to graduate from college and it has put a lot of pressure on me to do well and represent my family. My parents don't know what I'm working on half the time, but they always tell me I'll do well. However, I feel like I have to try really hard and constantly doubt myself.
I have this self-imposed belief that I must always do the best, not just well, because I feel like I need to represent my family well. They don't pressure me to go to school and get good grades, but somehow, I still feel like I have to do that. I'm not sure why I put so much pressure on myself.
I feel like I need to represent my family by being the best and there's a huge sense of responsibility on my shoulders. I'm responsible for helping around the house, my parents, and contributing financially. These responsibilities, along with school and work, often make me feel overwhelmed and I'm constantly rushing through my days.
I just finished a test and I'm feeling really afraid of how I did on it. I feel like I could have done a lot better. I consistently do well and get good grades, but I'm scared of not doing well enough. If I don't get an A, it's a bad thing for me, and even B pluses are kind of a disappointment.
I expect myself to earn A's, and when my work doesn't pull through, I feel like there's something that I did wrong. Sometimes, I even question if I'm fit to be a grad student. I've done consistently well, but I still feel like next semester might be a disaster and make me realize that coming to grad school was a bad decision.
I find it difficult to study, but I push myself to do it. However, even after finishing a paper and feeling good about it, I can't help but doubt my work and think it might totally suck after I turn it in.
I always push myself to be the best I can be in every aspect of my life, whether it's at school, home, or as a fiancé. I constantly take care of my parents who are older and retired. But sometimes, I wonder if my family would be fine without me and if I'm putting too much pressure on myself.
I have a major responsibility of helping my elder sister who suffers from severe depression. My parents are elderly and don't drive, so most of my free time is spent taking her to appointments and helping my parents take care of her. I also try to be there for her emotionally, spending time with her so she doesn't feel alone, and talking with my parents to understand her situation and figure out how to help her best.
As a patient, I struggle with feeling guilty when I take time for myself instead of helping my family or working on schoolwork. I feel overwhelmed by my responsibilities but also take pride in being able to manage them. I just wish that I could take care of myself without feeling like I'm disappointing anyone else or neglecting my other obligations.
As a patient, I've been feeling overwhelmed lately, and I'm trying to protect myself by just being in the moment and taking one thing at a time.
I'm a 12-year-old girl, and I feel a lot of pressure being relied upon by my immigrant parents. I've learned the language more quickly than them and had to take on more responsibilities. I have friends who are also immigrants but we don't really talk about it. It's like an expectation to help our parents if they don't speak the language. This is my first time looking at it as something I can decide.
I find it challenging to balance taking care of myself and giving my all for my family. My family is my everything, but I'm struggling to manage self-care and my responsibilities towards them, which leaves me feeling tired and burdened with pressure. I've felt like an adult all my life and I know I need to work on self-care, but it's hard to turn away when my family needs me.
I remember feeling overwhelmed and pressured to grow up when I was about 12 years old. My older sister made me handle difficult situations, like going to a new school in a different country where I didn't speak the language. She made me go to the office and ask for directions, even though I felt like she should have been taking care of me. I somehow managed to do it, but I've been feeling like I need to constantly perform and exceed expectations ever since.
I recently asked for advice on how to improve the relationship between my partner and me. I mentioned the possibility of her joining me at work, but I don't really like the idea of mixing business and personal life. I feel like I need help to come up with an alternative solution.
I think that's what she said once, but she's going to help me by pointing out all the things that she's pointing out.
I'm concerned about spending more quality time with my wife, but I have to work on Saturdays. I wonder if she would be okay with spending just one hour of quality time together out of the three hours we have. She doesn't work on Saturdays, and I thought about inviting her to my workplace just to be together.
I always felt that my spouse's new business was more important than our marriage. I'm supporting them, but sometimes I feel like I don't have a spouse anymore, just a person who's working hard to make money. How would I feel if my spouse told me to work all I want and they'd be behind me 100%?
I feel like my marriage is under pressure due to my constant worry about the business when I'm with my spouse. My spouse's suggestion that we spend less time together might help our marriage.
I'm dissatisfied with my marriage because I'm consumed with insecurities in my new situation, which is totally different from what I did for 25 years. I wish I could pay more attention to my wife, but all this is going on in my head and it's causing me to withdraw from her.
I've been constantly worried about my business - whether I made the right choice in leaving my previous job, if I'll have enough money to keep the business running, and finding the right people to work with. Additionally, I see my wife as my friend and lover, but we have different interests in terms of activities.
I don't think my partner and I have a typical parent-child dynamic in our relationship. We don't have children in the home, and we don't tell each other what to do. We consider ourselves equal partners.
I'm not the most social person in our marriage, and it's easier for me to talk to customers and employees because they're strangers, and I just have to please them for a minute. Last Sunday, we went on a picnic and I just hung out until it was over, not really initiating conversations.
I just heard what I said, and I'm worried about my marriage. My wife doesn't accept me the way I am and I hope it doesn't end our relationship. However, I know that hoping for things didn't work for me in the past.
I've been hoping for my business to succeed for 25 years, but it takes a lot of energy and effort for me to start. Not to mention the constant worry. It's like my business and my wife's are connected; if one fails, both will fail.
I've been thinking about how I would deal with my wife if I thought she was another business, and the relationship might fail, just like a business could.
I'm married and my wife works outside the home. She works with children, but as I've never had any, I'm not very interested in her job. However, we try to get along as partners.
Since I had a major life change, I've found myself less interested in children and I feel overwhelmed. I'm afraid that if I don't change and get closer to my wife, our marriage might fail.
My wife thinks that I'm prioritizing my job over our relationship, but I don't feel that it's more important. I just know that I have to put all my energy into it. I work six days a week and am gone for about 10-11 hours a day. On Sundays, we do activities together, but I have lost interest in them and can't seem to enjoy them as much as I used to.
I'm having trouble understanding my feelings about work, especially on Sundays when I actually stay away from work.
I'm feeling unsure about bringing my child with me to the therapy session. I'm afraid it won't work, and I don't know what to do if it doesn't.
I have been repeating certain actions in my marriage that I know are not working, like going through the motions of a picnic. I realize that my heart's not in it and I feel like it's not important. Am I making a choice to do this or is it just happening?
I've been telling my wife that our business could grow and then we'll be happy, but she's not willing to wait for that and may even leave me if I work more than I already do.
I've been working 6 days and taking Sundays off to spend time with my wife, but I often feel antsy during those picnics. I wonder if I should extend my workdays to 7 days a week.
I often catch myself blaming and complaining about my partner, sometimes overtly and sometimes just in my mind. I worry that this might be damaging our relationship.
I have this feeling that I've been criticizing, blaming, and complaining about my wife. The counselor I went to said that this kind of behavior is wrecking our marriage. I agree with the counselor's observation and I think our marriage can't stand this kind of behavior anymore. What should I do?
I have been working for long hours, and my counselor wants me to focus more on my problems rather than trying to have a good time. I am a creative person, but my creativity is limited to my work and doesn't really carry over to my personal life.
I often come up with business ideas at home and write them down. However, I haven't really thought of any creative ideas to improve my relationship with my wife.
I never thought of not talking to my wife as a choice, and it's hard for me to stay aware of this.
I feel like my partner criticizes me and it's affecting our relationship. I understand the concept of choice, but it's still difficult for me to know how to make better choices in these situations. I want to improve our relationship, but I'm not sure what to do.
As a patient, I recently had a session with my counselor, Dr. Glasser. He emphasized the importance of staying close with my spouse and asked me to practice some behavior to keep the relationship strong. He also suggested I bring my wife to the next session, but I told him I'll come alone if things work out, otherwise I'll bring her. He wished me a good week and hoped to see both of us next time.
I decided not to take physics this year after discussing with my parents over the summer. I felt strongly about this decision as I am more interested in languages, social studies, and English. My parents influenced me, thinking physics would just be extra work that I'm not interested in. Initially, I was interested in sciences, but I struggled in chemistry despite doing well, and I received more encouragement in languages.
I didn't get much encouragement in sciences, but I have decided by myself that I want to pursue communications, English, Social Studies, and language in my next four years.
I struggle with doing laundry, and I have been wondering if I need to work on having more loving feelings towards my mother.
I will remember your permission and it will help me. And I will remember mine too.
I feel angry at my mother when she gets after my sister and keeps persisting that my sister must do what she wants her to do. It's mostly about their relationship. I think, 'Why can't she just leave her be?' My sister and I are very close, and I've felt the pain my sister has about not being accepted. I've tried to let my mom know.
I am frustrated with my mother's controlling behavior towards my sister, and it makes me angry that she doesn't change her ways or love my sister the way she is. When I talk to her about it, she doesn't listen to me or even consider my opinion.
I have a troubled relationship with my mother who lives far away from me. I feel sad and troubled whenever I talk to her on the phone or think about her. She's complicated, and I think she might have schizophrenia or something. I'm not sure whether to feel angry, hurt, or protective of her, so I keep myself at a distance.
My mother recently called me when I was busy writing a paper, feeling quite anxious. She wants my sister to practice a certain religion, even though my sister doesn't want to. My mother keeps sending her things and calling her to convince her. This situation is making me angry, and I told my mother to just leave my sister alone and accept her the way she is.
During a conversation with my mother, we both started yelling at each other and eventually, I hung up on her.
I've been getting angry at my mother even when she's wrong, and this leads to fights or screaming. I end up feeling guilty for getting angry at her. I believe I should stay calm, listen to her more, and love her because she's my mother.
I often feel angry and agitated towards my mother because of her behavior, but I know it's not doing any good for either of us. I feel like I should be calm and collected, but it's hard to be that way.
I started feeling better when I realized how good it would feel to not have to feel guilty, and to not be angry. I also realized the weight of all that on me. Then, knowing that I have your permission to give that up, made me feel even better.
I don't have to make myself horrified, upset, angry, or guilty, I give myself permission to just feel sorry and disappointed. "Too bad that my mother's that way, but that's the way she is. And too bad that I'm easily angered, or the anger at myself, but that's the way I am." I try to exercise regularly, but I'm worried that I won't be able to manage my feelings without it.
I was thinking about what I really like to do, and I came up with hugging my kids. It's something I love to do, especially when it's cold outside.
I have been struggling with anger towards my mother and it is followed by guilt. I have avoided talking to her due to these feelings, but it's difficult for me to handle.
I am feeling anxiety and frustration due to my mother's constant bickering with my sister. I try to speak to her in a nice manner, but she persists and it's affecting me. I think there's also guilt inside me that's keeping me from getting angry.
I've been feeling really guilty, depressed, and down about my intolerance towards my mother. When she talks and I get angry about it, I feel so much guilt and it's affecting me negatively.
I sometimes think that if I had things to occupy my time, I would feel better. Maybe I should go out and find a job. But my partner is not thrilled about that and prefers that I stay in a safe environment. We don't need the money but for me, it's about being productive and getting satisfaction, which I currently don't feel.
As a military wife, I feel uncomfortable with the many expectations placed on me. I'm expected to be supportive, live on base, take care of the home and kids, and not work or leave the base often. I'm considering living off base and becoming a more productive contributing member of the larger society.
I have an education, but I'm not doing anything with it. Last time we talked about finding a church with a Spanish mass to connect with the Hispanic community and I went to one.
I've been feeling depressed because ever since I moved on base, I'm afraid that if I say what's really on my mind, people will judge me and turn their backs on me. It's been hard to express myself both ethnically and politically, and it's causing me a lot of distress.
As a military wife, I feel like I'm supposed to just stay home and be supportive and wait for him to come home. Most military wives don't work and stay on base most of the time. I wonder if this is the role I should take.
I don't have children, but I still feel the need to stay home on the base. Ideally, I'd like to move off base even if it's more expensive, but my husband isn't thrilled about that idea. I'm not too familiar with Hawaii and the other neighborhoods, but the base feels safe.
I've been considering moving off base because I don't feel like I fit in within the community, but my husband is worried about my safety in a new environment. Another idea I have is working since I don't do well just staying at home all day.
Since I moved to Hawaii, I've become more socially isolated and I feel sad all the time. I feel like crying all the time. I'm lonely because my husband, family, and close friends aren't here.
I feel drained and have no energy to go out or do anything, even though I'm not working or doing much.
As a Hispanic person, I recently moved to Hawaii from Florida, and I feel different here. I haven't thought about what I value about being Hispanic since moving.
I've been feeling a strong connection with my partner lately. We share whatever we're thinking, and we are very open about our thoughts and just the way we are.
Ever since I moved from Florida to Hawaii, I've noticed that I've become more negative in my thoughts.
Since I moved to Hawaii, I've been feeling unhappy despite everyone telling me I should be enjoying paradise. I used to see everything in a positive light back home and was always busy with friends, family, and community activities. But here, I don't go out much and everything seems negative.
I've had all these things going on in my life, and now I just want to stay home. I don't want to meet anybody, and whenever I do meet people, I'm not enthusiastic about it or looking forward to it.
I moved to Hawaii and I'm missing my Cuban culture, like the food and celebrations. It's hard to find ingredients and places to enjoy my culture here.
I moved to Hawaii, hoping to feel more comfortable, but I still struggle to enjoy the things I used to like back home. When I first arrived, I tried to make friends and meet new people, but it didn't work out well.
I always saw myself as a very assertive and outgoing person, but when I interact with people here, it feels out of place, like I talk too much or say things that are too forward. It makes me feel awkward to state my opinion.
I feel awkward stating my opinion and I am unsure how to act. Since moving to Hawaii, I've started to question my assertive and outspoken nature, wondering if it's something I need to change or if it's inappropriate.
I feel out of place living on the base here because everyone seems cold and reserved. I like speaking my mind, but when I do, I feel like I'm talking too much or saying something inappropriate. I also miss going salsa dancing with my friends back in Miami.
I feel that people here don't dress up and are very laid back. They enjoy having barbecues, which isn't really my thing. I miss going dancing or salsa, and it seems like nobody does that here.
I really miss the Cuban food from back home. There's not a lot of Cuban food here, just some Hispanic food, but it's not the same. I don't really cook, so it was easier to get the food I like when I was home.
I've been struggling with adjusting to different types of food and various cultural dishes since moving away from home. Going out to eat has become a hassle because I don't know if I'll like the food or not, and I haven't found a place that feels like home.
I don't know how familiar you are with Cuban history, but in general, people from Cuba leave their country to be able to express their political ideas freely and not be persecuted. That's the primary reason why my parents left. Being in the military, it feels very strange for somebody like me who's against the war. It feels like we can't talk about whether we're pro or against the war. We just have to support the troops, and my husband is deployed.
Lately, I've been feeling a lot of stress because I can't express my political thoughts openly about the war like I used to, without being looked down upon. I feel like I can't be myself and it has created a lot of tension within me.
I want to support my husband as a good wife, but it's difficult because I didn't enlist in the military, and I'm living on a base with different expectations. Back home, I could openly discuss anything about the war without being seen as unsupportive of my husband. Additionally, I'm adjusting to being Cuban in a community with few Cubans and not in favor of the ongoing war.
I have recently reconnected with my spirituality through a church, and it has given me meaning in my life. I've found a job and can finally afford to move off-base, but now I'm confused about whether I should do it or not. What do you think I should do?
I don't know. I'm struggling with a big decision between staying on-base and leaving. One of the negatives of staying on-base is that I feel like I don't fit in and can't be myself in that community.
I feel like I'm not living an ordinary life when I'm on-base, and I feel kind of sheltered. There's not a lot to do on-base, and I feel bored.
As a patient, I am not comfortable doing the same things that other women or military spouses do on-base. I can't think of any other negatives at the moment.
I went to a place where people were speaking Spanish, which was a nice change of pace. I also found a women support group there that I plan to attend their next meeting. They seem really nice and accepting, so I feel like I'll be able to fit in.
I recently joined a mixed group of Hispanic women and found it really enjoyable and supportive. They come from different cultural backgrounds, and some are not even Hispanic.
I recently started attending church and noticed a few things: people enjoyed speaking Spanish, and being able to do prayers in Spanish made me feel good. It reminded me of how I was back home and helped me reconnect with my spiritual identity, which I had forgotten was important to me.
I've been feeling the pressure of finding a job and becoming a contributing member of society, and I'm considering moving off-base to pursue that.
Lately, I've been feeling like maybe there's something wrong with me and that I need to be different. I used to be more outgoing and opinionated, but now I feel like I should be more reserved. This has led to me being confused and not myself, and when I see parts of my old self come out, I try to hold back. It's really frustrating and makes me avoid seeing people.
I avoid hanging out with people because I'm not sure how I should be acting, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm just not sure how to change it or what would be the right way to act. I end up being confused and I don't know what to do.
Ever since I moved to a new environment and started encountering a new culture, I've been feeling confused about my identity. People's response to me here is different than how they would have in Florida, which adds to my confusion.
I've been feeling overwhelmed lately because it seems like everything is just piling up on me.
I feel like there are two parts of myself. One is scared, crouched in a corner, and looks very tired, wanting to give up. The other part is standing tall with arms crossed, looking irritated, and has accomplished many achievements in life.
I've been having some issues lately with being legally blind and not being able to transport myself from place to place, which makes me feel inadequate and like a burden to others. Because of these feelings, I sometimes want to just give up.
I am an educated woman from a diverse background, with a number of academic degrees and at the brink of another one. However, I feel like there are two different dimensions to me, like two parts that are in some sort of a polarity position, as described by my therapist.
I am interested in trying a different technique today during our therapy session. My therapist suggested an experiential technique, a Gestalt-based technique, although modified. I am ready to follow the guidance and start the technique.
I noticed that the two parts of me seem to be getting closer together. And even though there are two different parts of me, it just seems as if it's easier to handle things when they're separated, but it would be easier to handle things if they were to support one another.
I feel like I have a dominant part and a submissive part within me, and I struggle with getting them to work together. They have expressed their feelings and what they see, but I'm not sure how to improve this relationship between them.
I am struggling with understanding the right response in a situation, and I would like you to help me with that.
I'm tired of always having to ask everyone to do things for me. There are so many things I can't do for myself and I wish that you would just leave me alone. Every once in a while, I would like to feel sorry for myself, and I would like some time to sit back, and to be who I am, and I don't need you bullying me.
I've been feeling confused about something, but now it's starting to make a lot of sense to me, and I feel better.
I asked for help to be a better person and to be stronger, and I expressed my desire to help others as well. After this, I went through an exercise where I visualized my hands getting closer together, and experienced a feeling of integration and completion. When asked about how it went, I responded that it was peaceful.
I used to feel like there was a constant battle going on inside me, and I couldn't just be happy with how things were. But now, it feels like there's a consensus and I don't feel as embattled as I did before.
I've been experiencing an internal conflict between two parts of myself, and it's causing me a lot of distress. They seem to polarize from one another, and I'm struggling to find a balance.
I think there's got to be a way to find some alternatives to my current situation, but I'm not sure if those alternatives are any sort of mechanism or pattern. I think it's just a matter of living and enjoying life when I can. One of my sisters seems to have a good handle on living like that.
I've been trying to learn from my sister, and it's been tough. The situation is impacting me in many ways, and when I mentioned my sister, I remembered how my brother and I are so much alike.
I'm struggling with trying to live up to great expectations, both from external sources and internally. I feel like I've internalized these expectations to a large degree, and I have a sense of never actually reaching the goal I've set for myself.
I struggle with perfectionism, and even though I've confronted it and tried to work through it, the idea of perfect still lingers in my mind. I feel like I was sold a bill of goods that there's something called perfect, but life doesn't bear that out.
I'm not sure if I've made my life too mechanistic or if circumstances have caused me to be this way. But I have to admit that as I take on more responsibilities, I am becoming more like that.
I tend to be on automatic response when things get difficult and there's a wall there, not letting too much get through. I act like the great pretender and I'm not sure how many people can see through that. Is that important?
I often feel like I'm pretending around people, especially at work. I maintain relationships at an arm's length and I'm not very open with them. I feel like people don't see the real me because of this.
I was having a conversation and paused for a moment to think about something. I wonder if it's okay to take a pause during a discussion.
I feel like my coping mechanisms helped me replace my drinking problem but it also has started to become a part of my everyday life. This is where I see the origin of my issue.
I've been trying to find balance in my life, and that's my quest right now. I feel like there has to be some sort of balance, but I haven't found it yet.
I feel a sense of hope now, since my voice has shown more inflexion in the last few minutes. I think it's because I know the way I get things accomplished, and I put a lot of pressure on myself to not just do things right but to do them more than right.
I have been struggling with perfectionism and the whole Type-A personality thing. It's very exhausting, and sometimes I feel like I'm wearing myself out just thinking about what I'm going to do today, before I even start.
I felt energized after the session, experiencing both a physical and mental change. I anticipate that future sessions will have the same effect. The counsellor is just wonderful.
I feel like my private internal life is quite low down on my list of priorities. However, I find myself constantly having thoughts and insights that I work through.
I have an opportunity on a daily basis because I am in my car a lot and that's some of that kind of down time. And also I get up real early in the morning just so I can have an hour kind of to regroup, but in effect, yeah, that's true, that's, that's true.
I am currently with you, trying not to think about other things that are bothering me, like my next tasks and phone calls. I've put those thoughts aside, and what helped me was taking deep breaths and regrouping.
Lately, I've been having a lot of internal chatter and it's difficult for me to focus during our sessions. However, right now I feel like my feelings are the priority in our communication and it helps me create a sort of safe space, like a cocoon.
Lately, I've been enjoying getting these small breaks from my hectic life where I can just take a breather and have a protected space to be in.
I've recently become more deeply aware of an issue I've always known about, though I'm unsure how to deal with it.
I have been keeping a journal for another endeavor, but not for personal reasons. The shopping list is stuck in my mind, and I feel like it might be helpful to continue journaling.
I haven't shared any details about my situation yet.
Recently, I had a very powerful experience working with my therapist, Jim. I felt an unprecedented level of comfort with him, even though the circumstances might have suggested otherwise. It was truly a wonderful time, and I couldn't have been more expressive about it.
I was worried about having a personal conversation with cameras around. I thought it would be uncomfortable and not spontaneous. But, to my surprise, Jim made the situation much more bearable, which transcended all of my concerns.
You know, I've started to understand certain behaviors of mine, like some things my mother used to do. It's been helpful for me to understand the potential origins and shed light on different things. But now, exploring the behavior is surprising, and I do have the capacity to laugh at myself. I go back to this whole thing about being counter-productive.
I'm struggling to balance my priorities and finding the time to enjoy life more. Right now, the quest for efficiency seems to be consuming me, and I feel that my priorities need to shift. I joke about winning the lottery, but part of me isn't entirely kidding.
I could not help but think about our session last week and although you told me not to do any homework, some thoughts just jumped out. I've realized this is a lot of information and an enormous experience, but I think I'll be more conscious of my way of dealing with things.
I found that taking breaks and pauses during our session helped me think more clearly and explore my thoughts deeper. At first, it may have been uncomfortable, but it became an essential part of the process. However, by the end of the session, I felt like there was a lot for me to think about and process.
I have been trying to absorb all the information and synthesize it, but it takes time. I can't do it in a short time, that's why pauses are important for me. Last time, after our session, I was overwhelmed at how energized I felt.
I recently had an experience where I felt overwhelmed with tasks on Monday morning. But after coming here, my mood improved significantly. I even felt lighter as I left.
Last week, my therapist made me realize that I never paid much attention to my non-verbal cues and their impact on others. This really staggered me. Today, he pointed out my monotone versus effervescent voice, which made me somewhat self-conscious, but I got lost in our session. It was interesting that he used it as a cue for me to consider not only my tone but also the message I am sending to others. However, when he asked me to pause and check internally, I found it uncomfortable at first.
I'm having trouble finding the right word to describe my situation. It's a confluence of things, you know, not just one issue. I don't think I'm a very reserved person, but maybe I am to some extent.
Lately, I've been feeling like I'm becoming more reserved than I used to be, and it's not something I've ever considered about myself before. I'm getting older, and I guess that might be a part of it. What do you think?
I'm trying to think this through but I don't want to set it in stone here. I believe there's so much held back, and as I'm getting into this new territory, I am cautious.
I find it amusing and fun to explore my personality and try to figure it out. I've always looked at exploring that from the origin side.
Today, I'm feeling harried and stressed. It's taking me more effort to concentrate on what we were doing than a week ago.
I'm feeling a little on edge today due to various pressures from both internal and external sources. My emotions are becoming quite overwhelming.
Recently, I've been thinking about how everything is circular and how it all goes back to setting priorities in life. I always have so many things going on, and I constantly berate myself for not being better at time management. I admit that I am tough on myself.
Recently, I have been trying to address a certain issue I feel is ingrained in me. I've tried to look at some of the origins of it and can pinpoint some of them, but I have to admit, I don't give myself a lot of breaks.
I recently had two sessions with a new therapist, and I was amazed by how quickly I felt comfortable with him. He has a warm and accepting presence, and the sessions flowed really well. It was great that we were able to focus on our conversation without being distracted by anything else. I usually have trouble focusing on the present moment, but during our sessions, I was completely engaged and in tune with what he was saying.
I felt very comfortable with my counsellor. He had this twinkle in his eye and his kindness, warmth, and non-judgmental attitude immediately put me at ease. It's hard for me to feel that way usually. I can't emphasize enough the feelings of safety and support he gave me, it felt like we were in a cocoon.
I'm not sure either right now. Ah, it felt like we turned a corner some place as you were talking. I am trying to figure it out too. It's like uhm, I don't know.
I feel anxious talking about my coping patterns and anxiety in this conversation. I'm not sure what kind of door examining these patterns would open. Highlighting them produces anxiety, and I don't think it's the most efficient way to cope.
I feel that life from a mechanistic viewpoint is not satisfying, and I'm not sure if I have any alternatives. I can think back and remember that I wasn't always like this.
I used to drink a lot, and I think I know why I did that. It was the only time when there weren't so many control dramas happening around me. Although it got out of hand, it did serve a purpose for me back then.
I feel that my perfectionism affects how I do things. I never want to do anything halfway; it's got to be done completely. I don't think I'm too extreme about it, but it does play a part in my life. I also believe it makes me avoid taking risks.
I mean once I'm in kind of a comfortable situation, maybe comfortable is not the right word, but that I know. Then it's difficult to make a change. That's been real evident to me as far as my career path up to this point.
Yeah, so I think that, that whole tendency. It creates a lot of dissatisfaction, and maybe that's the best way to explain it. And now that I'm talking to you about this, in relation to what I had stated earlier.
I'm struggling with perfectionism, and it's making it difficult for me to feel content with anything. I'm constantly searching for perfection, which I know doesn't exist. I'm just not sure how to deal with this or what to do about it.
I've been feeling like I've found a new challenge in my life, like a new mountain to climb. I think the first thing I have to do is to figure out how to approach this new challenge.
Sometimes, even now, I feel the motor going. I've gotten some help from relaxation training. In terms of Introspective Developmental Counseling, I'm recommending it to anybody who goes into counseling or psychotherapy training. They should look at themselves in their own developmental history.
I have been working with my fellow students in pairs to explore some topics deep down, practicing developing images and strengths. I received positive feedback from one of them about my pacing and they felt I was with them. However, I feel like there's still room for improvement. Can you provide any suggestions?
As a patient, I appreciate all the help you have provided me by summarizing some key things in our conversation, which has helped me understand my story a little better.
I'm here because people say I need to be here, but I don't know about any feelings.
I spend too much time by myself. I don't talk to people. I don't go places. I don't do things, just kinda sit home, watch TV, go to work, to my schoolwork. And I stick to myself, my computer. I spend a lot of time with my computer. That's about it. When I have something to say, I talk to Ralph. Ralph's my computer.
I think I have workaholic behavior. When I go skiing, I love to be there at eight o'clock so I can be on the slope first before they get skid off. As long as I can stand it, I go up and back repeatedly, never stopping to take a break.
I'm usually quite energetic and fast-paced, which led my wife, Mary, to ask me if I would ever slow down. I'm grateful to have a patient wife who can handle my tricky-itchy ivy personality.
Recently, I've come to realize that many of my behaviors and decision-making patterns were established during my childhood. I've been reflecting on the influence of my early years on my adult life, considering the effects of social learning and psychoanalytic theories.
I think a lot of what we are goes back to what we were in the beginning. Whether it's biology, or environment, the way those interact. I'm really quite struck, as I was going through with, through this, this really, the issues of wanting to burst free and the other part saying, hey, I can't burst that for you. I'm going to have to keep it under control, this constant battle for me.
I grew up during the Depression in a very small, rural area. Is there anything about this part of my life that could have had a significant effect on me?
When I was a baby, I was so noisy in the nursery that they moved me to the laundry room. This has always been a joke among my family and friends. I find it funny sometimes, but it also makes me feel a bit uneasy.
Apparently, I didn't quite fit in at that time. Even as I mentioned that, I still get a little feeling of maybe you even saw me twitching a little bit. I don't feel real comfortable about it. One time you think it's funny but then you sit there and you're thinking, well, what is this business about? I always was a pretty active kid so at least it makes me feel a little off-center.
I remember living at the back of the store when I was a kid. I felt a general sense of closeness with my parents and things were really smooth at that time. However, there was no central heat in those days, so I would run downstairs and get dressed behind the stove.
I'm trying to prepare myself for discussing my childhood experiences. I feel a bit hesitant but I'm willing to answer the questions.
I want to talk about how my early life stages are affecting my present life. We can look at some details of my past and analyze their impact on what's happening in my life now.
I grew up in rural Washington state, and I was born in 1933 during the depression. My dad ran a grocery store, and my mom came from poverty too. The week they were getting married, my dad lost his job, and this has always been in the back of my mind.
I've been having a hard time in the early stages of my life, mainly because of the effects of the depression. I see myself as the 'Depression kid,' always worried about whether things will be okay in the future.
I've been dealing with a lot of planning for tomorrow type of stuff.
I always feel like I have to be doing something. From the moment I wake up, I start running and I basically run until I fall asleep. A concrete example from my childhood, between the ages of four and five, when this issue was very prevalent.
I have experienced this feeling like a motor is driving me, rather than me being in control. I know there are some hyperactive kids who also talk about this motor feeling, and I think it speaks to me and relates to a particular image I have in mind.
I remember a time of intense activity and movement, and I was standing at the door of a house, unsure if I should go in or out. Eventually, I went in and out, but if I were to go out, it felt like something was driving me.
I remember saying to myself that I'm not gonna let this motor run me. I wanted to control it. Basically, I stayed inside and learned gradually to control that motor, more or less.
I remember how good it felt to crawl into bed between my parents to get warm when it was cold outside. I don't recall anything particularly impressive happening before kindergarten, but I do remember a general feeling of smoothness and good relationships. There were relatives living nearby, just a quarter mile away in both directions.
The whole family was there and we are fairly close together as a family. Being born in 1933, it was the bottom of the birth rate, and for a long time, almost a century, there was nobody to play with. I experienced an awful lot of alone time and had an immense lot of alone time.
When I was a preschool child, I think I was a hyperactive child. I would often run into things, push and shove, and break stuff. This kind of behavior bothered my mother.
I remember when I was younger, people used to joke about my attention issues, and it often made me feel like there was something wrong with me. However, I didn't have ADD because, for some reason, I could always focus.
As a child, I often had to play alone, and I've always been very hyperactive and busy.
I think my parents provided enough stability and structure for me, but now that I think about it, I suspect all that control didn't come from within.
I believe I might have been a hyperactive kid growing up, and I didn't have a strong behavioral model during those days. I didn't have any siblings during that time either, but my sister came along nine years later.
I experienced a traumatic event in my childhood which was quite a challenge for a normal child to deal with, and I also had sibling rivalry issues.
I remember feeling very happy and safe when I used to get into the covers between my mom and dad. It was a comforting event during my childhood and I think it was an important part of my development.
I think, I guess, it's just a repeat of the last one, I guess. It's a dangerous thing to ask a professor about pattern. Do you know that? I think I really kinda always sad that...
Lately, I've been spending most of my time on my computer, attending classes, and I'm planning to go home for the holidays. My relationship with my family is okay, I guess.
I think of myself as just too grown up hyperactive child. Granny goose, it's kinda like, I still kinda like to steal the apples and challenge things. I do things a little bit differently than others. You've seen some of my workaholic behavior, not a full workaholic, but if I play, I'm a playuholic.
I feel like everything is done in a kind of energetic fashion, with lots of energy and quick movements, which you might have seen in me. However, I think a lot of people perceive me as cool and controlled.
I think a lot of my issues in life go back to childhood experiences. It's intriguing to think of myself as a five-year-old kid making decisions that have impacted my life. In some ways, I feel good about myself when I think about those experiences.
Except I'm still, at the same, having some troubles with impulse control, and as my wife Mary says, 'Where did that off the wall comment come from?' So, that, ah, you don't always leave our past behind, I don't think.
Lately, I've been experiencing a general feeling of patience and love.
I am getting very frustrated at home because I'm not sharing something. I need help with some personal issues related to this. I think I have about seven months.
I've been dealing with very conservative parents lately, and while the younger ones seem to be more open to a range of possibilities, the older, more tenured individuals are not. I'm worried about how they, along with faculty, administrators, and students, might react to me.
I am part of a tough club and I fear that if they find out that I am a lesbian in a life partner relationship with a child, there will be a lot of pressure. I am very afraid that the repercussions may involve them taking away some of my extra-curricular activities with the students and the sports.
I'm struggling with fully coming out as gay in all spheres of my life. It feels like I'm living two lives and I want to stop the conflict, but I'm afraid. My partner and I are experiencing a wonderful moment in our lives - she's pregnant. However, I can't share her morning sickness or ultrasound pictures with others.
I can't have pictures on my desk of my child, and if I choose to do this, I'm going to have to...
I feel stronger because I have the support of my family behind me, and I think it can only benefit me as well as the students who are going through similar life changes. They'll be able to talk with me.
I feel like coming out could help me be a better role model for my students and create a safe space. However, I'm unsure how the school administration will view this change.
I think the biggest step for me is taking the initiative to start a new project, and I would really appreciate any support you can provide by reaching out to different people and administrators.
I'm involved in the drama club, and I'm afraid I'm going to lose that, and from that, they can take it away from me. And in doing that, the students themselves are going to know about it.
I'm worried that because of gossip in the school, I'll lose the rapport I've worked so hard to build with my students. I'm also concerned about losing some of the additional duties I do here.
I'm feeling conflicted because I'm afraid of facing a difficult battle in life, but at the same time, I'm scared that if I don't face it, I'll have an even bigger battle at home.
I'm worried that I might lose the woman I love and my child in some way if I don't become more outgoing at school.
I feel like I have been living split lives and I am now empowering myself to come out and join these lives together.
Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with work and family responsibilities, and it's causing me stress and anxiety.
I feel that in order to regain control in this situation, I try not to think about it. I attempt to distract myself with shopping, housework, and watching TV, but the thoughts still come back.
I've been feeling down and unable to attend class for about a month and a half now, since my partner and I started arguing. I've been trying to push these thoughts away and let go of school, but the sadness keeps coming back.
I feel conflicted about not going to school because my husband wants us to start a family now. He has a good job and we're financially okay, but I worry that I'm missing out on finding purpose and meaning in my life. I haven't talked to him about this because he would probably laugh at me and call my feelings childish.
I feel like it's my fault for the conflicts and it's affecting my daily life. I keep playing arguments in my head and can't be productive. There's a part of me that wants more than just being a housewife, like the confident woman I heard speaking at an event.
I have a hard time balancing my emotions about missing school, but also wanting to stay home to protect my family. I'm trying to keep my actions consistent, but my thoughts keep flip-flopping, causing emotional reactions. These thoughts sometimes make me feel stressed, but it's a different kind of stress than when I have a paper due the next day. I try to push these thoughts aside because they bring on feelings I don't want to deal with.
I often feel an inner turmoil that makes it hard for me to focus on my daily tasks. When I have these thoughts, I just lie in bed and don't do anything. Even if I don't try to think about it, these thoughts just come to my mind and I have to stop them, otherwise, I'll just end up lying in bed all day.
I remember the last time I had that thought, it was at a store with loud music that blocked out the feeling. But when there's no distraction, like on the bus or street, I get sad. The sadness feels like it's in my stomach.
I don't know, it, maybe about, around ten I guess. Between five and ten, I think. Definitely between the time that my husband goes to work and the time that he comes back from work, when I'm by myself. It's the right choice though. You know, it's the right choice I make, it's the practical choice. It's the right choice to make.
I wish I could go and have the money to do it, but I can't because I need to consider my family's needs. It's like I'm torn between my desires and what's best for my family.
I never thought I would enjoy going to school so much, and now it feels more purposeful than just being a homemaker, doing daily chores. I like attending classes, meeting friends, and discussing things. I'm also surprised at my own academic performance and the comments I receive. But my husband thinks I don't need to be doing this right now.
I've been staying home and not attending my classes because my husband, who is the breadwinner and paying for my classes, said there's no point in me going. I feel that if there's no need for our family, then there's no point in me continuing my education, even though it will take a couple more years to finish.
I'm Annie and it's my first time getting counseling. I'm feeling a bit nervous and unfamiliar with the process. To be honest, I didn't really want to come.
I haven't been going to class, and my friend was worried about me. She's been trying to contact me for a few weeks, but I wasn't answering her calls. Eventually, she came to my door and made me go with her. I think I'm dropping out anyway, so I feel like there's no point in going to class anymore.
I went back to school because my husband lost his job, and we thought it would be better if I got a job too. I enrolled in a community college to make myself more marketable. However, my husband has found a new job, and we are financially stable now. He thinks I don't need to continue with school.
I thought that, we thought that at this point in our life, you know, we'd be starting a family and that's what I thought I wanted, and I do. I still do, maybe not yet. So, yea. So I don't know. It's different than what I thought I wanted I guess. I remember getting an A on a paper, analyzing a character from a movie, and my professors appreciated the insight and depth I put into it. It made me feel that those things are worth something.
I feel like it doesn't matter what I want, and it's frustrating. I am more frustrated with myself than my husband. We argue, and I can't win arguments with him because I'm not quick on my feet. I also feel like I'm flip flopping a lot.
I have been experiencing conflicting feelings about returning to school, as it has given me a sense of purpose and I have discovered new talents in myself. However, my husband is not supportive and says that I shouldn't be doing this. I feel like I'm caught between my own desires and his opinions. I'm not really sure what to expect from this counseling session, as my friend suggested it, but I haven't had any experience with therapy before.
When I was in school, I started to feel purposeful and found meaning in my daily life through the conversations with my classmates, the questions professors asked, and the papers I wrote. It was fun to apply the things I was learning, seeing patterns, and understanding cause and effect. I felt good at it, though not the best.
I've been feeling very overwhelmed lately and I'm not sure why. I've been trying to figure out if there's a pattern to my emotions, but I haven't had any luck yet.
I feel torn between my roles as a housewife and as a student looking for purpose and meaning. I even felt childish when I was crying earlier. I am willing to do the homework you've suggested to help me between our sessions.
My counsellor gave me homework where I have to catch my thoughts and notice who they are coming from. They believe that as I start to change those thoughts that are hurting me, I will be able to function better. I just need to name where these thoughts are coming from.
Lately, my partner and I have been fighting, but only regarding a specific issue. Before this issue, we didn't really have fights because I am very easygoing and usually just go along with what he wants. It's been affecting my daily life and I try not to think about it.
I am struggling when my partner is not at home. I try to distract myself from the thoughts but it still impacts me. I've been watching a lot of reality TV, cleaning, shopping, and doing things that I wouldn't usually do.
Sometimes when I'm shopping, I have fleeting thoughts about the conflict between me and my friend. I might notice the time and think that it's time for class, but then I push those thoughts aside.
I'm just reliving the arguments that we've had, and I feel like such a child. I think this is a childish reaction.
I guess I am feeling overwhelmed and struggling with the idea of my purpose in life. For the longest time, I thought my purpose was to be a mom and take care of my family. But now, I find myself flip-flopping, thinking that maybe I have a different purpose. I feel like this is causing tension between the person who wants to have a different purpose and the person who is staying home and not going to class.
Well, I can't change what I want because we worked so hard, you know, why change the plan. And if I flip flop now, what if I flip flop later? So you know, it's a concern a little bit.
I feel childish for having certain emotions because I'm an adult and I should be past that. My partner called it childish too, which hurts me as I don't like being called a child. I try to push these emotions aside.
Sometimes I think we do that to kind of survive, survive the moment, you know, survive the argument or survive the situation, you know, kind of push the emotion back down. If I cry in front of him, that would be more childish, wouldn't it? I know, but it's tough to do that in the moment when someone is judging you for it.
I'm constantly flip-flopping and feeling frustrated when I'm alone at home as my husband works. My mind can't decide what I want and what I should have. I feel like he doesn't understand my desire to go back to school. I struggle to argue with him because I can't express my thoughts coherently and feel even more frustrated with myself.
I am stressed about school, my friends, and the expectations of my partner. We hang out after school, and sometimes I am not home when he wants me to be. He wants dinner ready and the house in a certain way, but with school and other commitments, I am struggling to meet these expectations. Additionally, he considers my schooling an unnecessary expense, which causes more disagreements between us.
I feel like I'm stuck between two realities - one where I'm just a housewife and the other one where I'm a confident person who goes back to school. I did fine on a couple of papers, but I'm not like her, the confident woman. I'm not as well-spoken or commanding as she is.
I was hesitant to come in for counseling, but my friend suggested it. After having some time together with you, I feel that it's not as scary as I thought it would be. I don't want to cry anymore, but I think it would be okay to come back.
