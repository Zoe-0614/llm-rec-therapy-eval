It is understandable that when you are in the middle of an anxiety attack you may be unable to perform breathing exercises or count to 10. However, if you can prepare yourself by practicing these techniques when you are feeling well, you may be better equipped to use them when you are feeling anxiety. Additionally, having a supportive partner like your husband who is able to talk you through an attack can be a great source of comfort and relief.
*
It is understandable that you are concerned about your children feeling that you were never there for them. It is important to be mindful of their feelings and to reassure them that going back to school is temporary and that you are still their mother and will always be there for them. Open communication with them about your decision and the reasons behind it is key. Additionally, be sure to make time for them and dedicate quality time to them when you are together. Make sure to also maintain regular routines and establish a trusting relationship with them so they know they can come to you with any concerns they may have.
*
It is understandable that you may feel defensive when your friend points out your behavior. It is likely that you want to be open and honest with her, but it can be difficult to take criticism. A helpful thing to remember is that her intention is to help you, and that her feedback can be used as an opportunity for growth. You could also ask her to tell you specifically what you could do differently instead of pointing it out. This could help you gain a better understanding of what she is seeing and create a more open dialogue.
*
The most effective way to break a persistent behavior is to replace it with a new, healthier one. Identify a positive activity that you can do instead of loading the dishwasher, such as taking a walk, calling a friend, or curling up with a good book. When you feel the urge to load the dishwasher your way, replace it with the new behavior. You may need to repeat this process many times before it becomes a habit, but with patience and practice, it can be done.
*
It sounds like your husband is providing a healthy balance to your perfectionist tendencies. He is right, things do get done even if the house is messy, and learning to let go of the small tasks can be a useful skill to have. Taking time to really think through the task before you and breaking it down into smaller steps can help with feeling overwhelmed and out of control.
*
It is understandable that it is difficult to relax when no one is forcing you to do it. To help you keep up with it, try to make a conscious effort to pay more attention to your body and its needs. Take some time throughout the day to notice your breathing, feel your feet on the ground, and take in the environment around you. You can also practice mindfulness activities such as journaling, meditating, or stretching. This can help you relax and become more aware of your body's needs.
*
It is understandable that you put a lot of emphasis on your grades, as they are a way to validate your abilities. It is also understandable that you feel disappointed when your grade is lower than you hoped for, or when someone else has a higher grade. It can be helpful to remember that grades are only one measure of your abilities, and that there are many other qualities that make you special and unique. Talking to a trusted adult or mentor can also help put your achievements in perspective and remind you of your strengths.
*
It is recommended to challenge yourself with these activities regularly in order to make progress. How often you do them will depend on how quickly you are able to complete them and how often you feel comfortable doing them. You may want to start with small tasks and gradually increase the difficulty as you become more comfortable.
*
I'm sorry to hear that your mother-in-law is being difficult. It's great that your husband and his brother are supportive, and it sounds like his brother was particularly upset by her behavior. It's important to have a supportive network when dealing with difficult family members.
*
It sounds like you have some conflicting goals here. On one hand, you want to be more organized and have a cleaner house, which is a great goal. On the other hand, you also want to give up the control of your husband's space, which can be difficult to do.

One way to approach this might be to focus on one area at a time. Focus on cleaning and organizing the areas of your house that you feel comfortable with, and work on letting go of controlling your husband's space a little at a time. For example, you could start by asking your husband to do something in his own space, without you offering any guidance or advice. You could also focus on one area of his space at a time, such as cleaning or organizing one room or making one change.

Over time, as you practice these skills, you should find that you become more comfortable with both. Good luck!
*
It sounds like you have a lot on your plate! It's understandable to feel frustrated with your friend if you feel like she's not pulling her weight. Even though it might be difficult to confront her, it's important to have a conversation about expectations and how you can both support each other.
*
I'm sorry, I didn't catch the last part of your sentence.
*
It is understandable that you feel anxious about your mom's involvement in your children's lives. However, it is important to remember that you are the parent and you have the right to set boundaries and decide what is best for your family. Having said that, it is also important to remember that your mom is a part of your family and should be supported. One way to do this is to create a routine that works for all of you. For example, you could have a regular Skype call once a week and set aside special days for her to visit. This way, you can all look forward to special times together and your mom can be involved in a more meaningful way.
*
It is understandable that letting go of small things can be difficult and that you might be feeling anxious and having difficulty sleeping. It is important to identify what is causing this so that you can take steps to alleviate the symptoms. Have you been experiencing any stressful life events recently? Are you feeling overwhelmed by tasks or responsibilities? Have you changed any routines or habits recently? Knowing the cause can help you to create a plan of action to manage the symptoms. It is also important to practice self-care, such as getting enough sleep and exercise, eating healthy meals, and engaging in relaxing activities. Talking to a therapist may also be beneficial in helping you to identify the root cause of the problem and develop strategies to manage it.
*
It is understandable that you would be hurt if your friend doesn't want to attend your event, especially if you put in a lot of effort into organizing it. It can be helpful to take a step back and remember that it is her decision and not a reflection of you. Reflect on her reasons for not attending, and if possible, ask her why she made that decision. If it is possible, suggest alternative solutions such as inviting different friends or rescheduling the event. Ultimately, it is important to remember that it is her decision and that you still care for her even if she doesn't attend.
*
I'm sorry to hear that. It can be hard to recognize when something isn't okay, and it's understandable if you feel overwhelmed. It's okay to ask for help and support if you need it; there are people who care about you who can help you through this.
*
It is understandable to feel confused after making a decision to get angry and then realizing how difficult it is to take a shower. It is often difficult to know how to move forward after making a decision. It may be helpful to take some time to reflect on the decision and consider the potential outcomes of each path. Additionally, it may be helpful to talk to someone close to you about how you are feeling in order to gain some perspective. Taking a shower can be difficult if you are trying to work around a power washer, so it may be helpful to ask for help if necessary.
*
Adam had been feeling like something was wrong for a while, but he couldn't figure out what it was. He had been distant and withdrawn for weeks, and when Sarah asked him what was wrong, he couldn't explain it. Eventually, he decided to leave and try to figure out what was bothering him. He wanted to give himself space and time to figure out what was happening and why he was feeling this way. He hoped that by leaving, he could find some answers.
*
I can understand this feeling. For me, it's important to give back to the community and help others reach their goals. Helping others can often be just as rewarding as achieving success ourselves.
*
I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. It's understandable that you have a history with drugs, and it's great that you were able to maintain a successful recovery while in a relationship. It's understandable that the difficulties in the relationship and your partner's leaving would be difficult for you.

It's understandable that you don't want to write things down to help you remember. There are other techniques you can try though. For example, creating mnemonic devices or using visualization techniques can help you remember things. You can also use apps or software to help you organize information in a visual way. Additionally, you can use techniques such as spaced repetition, which is a method of reviewing information over a period of time, or using flashcards, which can help you create study routines and help you commit things to memory.
*
I applaud your decision to take charge of your recovery and attend a support group. Support groups are an invaluable resource for recovering individuals and can provide a valuable source of strength and hope. I wish you all the best as you continue on your journey.

It is understandable to be worried about how much you can do while you are recovering. It is important to listen to your body and take breaks when you need to. Even if your doctor says you can do as much as you can, it is best to listen to your body and take it easy if you need to.
*
It is understandable that you are concerned about your partner using drugs, especially if it leads back to issues with the Department. You may want to consider setting boundaries with your partner and finding a support system outside of your relationship to help you stay on track. Ultimately, it is important to prioritize your recovery and take the necessary steps to ensure that it stays maintained.
*
It is understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and like it is too hard sometimes. It is important to remember that you are not alone and there is help available.

It is understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed. As a parent, it is important to take care of yourself first so you can be the best parent possible.

Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor if you are feeling overwhelmed or uncertain.
*
It is understandable that you are feeling tired and sluggish and want to use the drug to give you a bit of energy. However, it is important to remember that the drug is not a long-term solution to your fatigue. You may want to consider speaking with a doctor or a counselor to explore other strategies to help you deal with your fatigue and find more long-term solutions.
*
I usually wake up between eight and ten in the morning. As soon as I open my eyes, I reach for the nearest blinds and open them, allowing natural light to fill the room. I then go through my morning rituals - stretching, drinking a glass of water, and doing some light exercises. After that, I have a quick breakfast before starting my day.
*
It is understandable that you are feeling down when others' opinions are affecting you so much. It is important to remember to focus on your own self-worth and not let others' opinions define you. Reach out to someone you trust and ask for help. You can also try positive self-talk, journaling, or talking to a therapist.
*
I think scaling could be a useful tool for this client, as it allows him to feel less overwhelmed by making his goals more manageable. At the 10 end of the scale, he could have a clean house and be able to see his friends, with whatever else he thought was important being added in at the 10 end. This way, he can feel more in control and empowered to take steps towards his goals.
*
It is understandable that you are concerned about your friend's progress in sorting through his papers and organizing his life. You could process the double bind with him by expressing your admiration for his efforts and encouraging him to continue in this direction. You could also reflect his feelings back to him by saying something like, “It must be gratifying to feel like you’re gaining more control over your life by getting rid of old papers and organizing your things.” Ultimately, it is his decision how he wants to proceed, but your support and encouragement will definitely help.
*
I think your ideas for a therapy approach are great. Solution-focused brief therapy is an evidence-based approach that has been proven to be effective in helping people move towards their goals. The crystal ball technique is an interesting way to help people access their own innate problem-solving skills, and I think it could be an effective tool in the therapist's toolbox.
*
It is understandable that this person may feel hesitant about transitioning, especially if they are unsure of the process or the social implications of being transgender. It can be helpful to provide support and reassurance, while also encouraging them to explore the possibility of transitioning. They may benefit from speaking with other transgender people who have gone through the transition process, or reading stories and articles about the experiences of others. Ultimately, the decision to transition should be theirs, and you can be there to help them explore their options and provide emotional support either way.
*
As a patient, it can be difficult to gauge a client's commitment to change. One idea to consider is to create a contract between the client and yourself outlining the goals and expectations for the client's treatment. This way, both parties can be held accountable to the agreed-upon goals and can discuss any issues that may arise. Additionally, it can be helpful to set up a system of incentives and rewards for meeting goals, as this can further emphasize the client's motivation to change.
*
I'm glad to hear that our sessions have been helpful for you. It's great to hear that you are gaining clarity and making decisions more easily.
*
I understand how overwhelming it can be to go through all your belongings and decide what to keep and what to discard. It can be helpful to have a plan for what to do with items you’re not sure about - such as donating them to someone who can make use of them, or storing them in a safe place for a set amount of time. It can also be helpful to have a support system of friends or family who can offer guidance and understanding if needed. Taking small steps and being gentle with yourself can help make the process smoother. Wishing you the best of luck on your journey!

*
It is understandable that you are frustrated with your client's lack of response to your suggestions. However, before you take any drastic measures, it is important to consider other strategies that may be effective. Have you considered providing positive reinforcement when he follows through with your suggestions? You could also consider making the expectations clear and providing him with specific feedback when he meets or exceeds those expectations. Additionally, you could try to gain his trust by being open and honest with him and establishing a collaborative relationship. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide what course of action is best, but it is important to explore all possible options before making a decision.
*
I'm sorry to hear that you're facing so much backlash. It's understandable to be feeling scared and embarrassed right now, but remember that you didn't do anything wrong and you shouldn't let anyone else's opinions of you define you.

You will make it through this and you will be stronger for it.
*
It is understandable to feel fear when you are expressing enthusiasm about something you are devoted to. This is a natural human emotion and it is important to acknowledge and process those feelings. Fear can be a sign of respecting yourself and recognizing the boundaries that you need to maintain for your own safety.

The fear you are feeling may be a sign of appreciating the risks that come with taking risks, and it is important to stay mindful of the risks and rewards of your actions.
*

I'm sorry to hear about your parents' passing. It's understandable that you feel the loss of your parents, but it's good that you don't seem to be afraid of death itself. It can be difficult to process the death of a loved one, but talking about it can help. Have you discussed this with anyone? There may be someone you can talk to, such as a therapist or trusted friend.
*
I'm afraid to be satisfied. It felt good to say it. I'm satisfied with the way I said it. I'm just animated.
*
I understand how difficult it can be to find the bright side in such situations. It can be helpful to take a step back, take a deep breath, and focus on what you can do in the moment. Sometimes, simply engaging in conversation and listening to their stories can be enough to bring a sense of joy or comfort. Other times, it may be helpful to focus on small achievements, such as making a patient smile or helping a patient feel safe or comfortable. Reminding yourself that these moments can create tremendous joy, even in a difficult situation, can help you stay focused on the positive.
*
I can understand why the counsellor would not fall for your charming evasions this time. It might be because you know that they are not going to give you what you want, so you are trying to make them understand that you are not trying to evade their questions.
*
It is understandable to be feeling anxious about job security in this uncertain economic climate.

Taking steps to build and maintain relationships with people in your industry can go a long way in providing security and peace of mind.
*
It is understandable that you are hesitant to feel satisfied again after having had your satisfaction taken away. However, you may find it helpful to remind yourself that you have the power to choose how you respond to situations and to take care of yourself. By recognizing your own needs and taking steps to protect yourself, you can build a sense of security and trust. You can also practice self-care and self-soothing. This may include journaling, exercising, talking with friends, or engaging in other self-nurturing activities. Taking care of yourself and being mindful of your needs can help to build trust in yourself and in the world around you.
*
It is understandable that you are feeling fearful of losing something important to you. Grief is an emotional experience that can be difficult to process and it is no surprise that you are feeling the effects of it eight years later. Losing a parent can be incredibly difficult and can cause deep feelings of insecurity about the future.

It is important to remember that you are not alone in your experiences and that there are people who care about you. Consider reaching out to a trusted friend or therapist who may be able to help you process your feelings and move forward in a positive light.

Talking to a professional may also help you find more effective ways to cope with your illness.
*
It can be very difficult to separate a person from their actions, especially when the actions are something that the person regrets and is ashamed of. In your case, it might help to focus on what your husband is feeling instead of what he did. Acknowledge his feelings, show empathy and understanding, and let him know that he is not defined by his actions. Focus on the person and not the action and let him know that he is still worthy of love and respect even if he was not in the right state of mind. This can be a difficult process and may require the help of a therapist or other mental health professional.
*
It can be incredibly difficult to remember your worth when you are in the midst of an emotional situation. However, it is important to remember that one bad behavior does not define you. Everyone makes mistakes, and it is how we respond to those mistakes that truly matters. Acknowledge the mistake, apologize if necessary, and focus on the positive aspects of yourself. Remind yourself that you are more than just one bad behavior.
*
It sounds like your husband is playing a game of blame and it is not healthy for either of you. It is natural to have problems in relationships, but it is not helpful to play the "what if" game and place blame on one another. It is important to focus on solutions and understanding each other. It is also important to recognize when one person is playing the blame game and to set boundaries on it.

Talking to someone close to you about your decision may help you make the best choice for yourself.
*
It's important to remember that you can't take responsibility for other people's feelings and actions. Everyone is responsible for their own feelings and actions, and you can't control how other people respond or react.

Acknowledge your feelings, and then take action to move forward and create a better life for yourself and your family.

It sounds like you're feeling a bit restricted by your mom's rules. It's understandable to want to feel a bit more independent and have more freedom. You could try having a conversation with your mom about how you feel - explain that you'd like to be able to come and go as you please, but you also understand why she has the rules in place and want to respect them. You could also suggest some compromises, like being able to stay out a bit later or come back home earlier. It's important to be able to have a healthy balance between independence and safety so it's important to have a discussion and find a solution that works for both of you.
*
It sounds like your mom is simply being cautious and is trying to protect you. It is understandable to want to give you more freedom, but it is important to also keep you safe. You could suggest coming up with some rules that you both agree on, such as the minimum age of the driver or the number of hours you are allowed to be out. You could also suggest a curfew or a check-in system so that your mom can feel more comfortable with the freedom that you are granted.
*
I can understand why you appreciate your mother's education background and are pursuing a master's degree in education, and why you inherited your father's artistic abilities and mindset. It must have been difficult at the time to understand why your mother didn't confront or discipline you for getting caught with cigarettes, but it is clear now that she was modeling a respectful approach to education. It's great that you have such positive role models in your life.
*
It is understandable that you are feeling frustrated and sad. It can be difficult to process the emotions that come with feeling high maintenance and realizing that you have alienated friends.

*
I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. It is understandable that the experience has made you wary of drinking.

It is best to avoid alcohol entirely if possible, as this is the best way to stay safe.
*
It is understandable that you don't enjoy being around your friends when they are drinking. Although drinking can be a fun activity, it is important to respect your own boundaries. You could suggest alternate activities, such as going for a walk or watching a movie, or simply respectfully excusing yourself when the situation becomes uncomfortable for you.
*
It is understandable that your mom might not be the best source of information about your childhood symptoms. However, you may want to try to ask her if she can remember anything about your symptoms when you were younger. You could also try talking to other family members or friends who may have known you since you were young. You could also look into other sources of information, such as records from your early years in school or medical professionals who may have treated you in the past. Ultimately, it may come down to how comfortable you feel talking to your mom and how much she can remember.
*
I understand your disagreement with your mom, but I think it's important to be respectful and understanding of her perspectives. Everyone is different, and that's okay! Your mom may have had a different experience in school than you did, but that doesn't make her experience any less valid. It might help to ask her more about her experiences and find out what she learned from them. That way, you can gain a better understanding of her point of view and appreciate her for who she is.
*
I was very close to my stepbrother Rick, as opposed to my other stepbrother Ben, who scared my friends. They didn't like Ben, and he looked like a goat and would give them dirty looks. I don't see Ben often, as he's not close to me and lives about 20 minutes away.
*

It is understandable that you are feeling tension around staying in the present moment. It is likely that you have a deep desire to experience and savor this moment, but there is also a fear that you will miss out on something.

To help resolve this inner conflict, it can be helpful to practice mindfulness and non-judgmental awareness of your experience in the present moment. This can help you come to a deeper acceptance of the present moment, and a recognition that it is okay to be in the moment without fear of missing out on something. With this acceptance and recognition, you will find it easier to relax and enjoy the present moment with a deeper appreciation.

It is also important to remember that life is always changing and offering us new opportunities to experience and savor. The eclipse of the moon is an example of this, and there will be other opportunities in the future. By accepting this, you can let go of any reluctance to be in the present moment and allow yourself to fully appreciate and enjoy it.

Accepting the present moment also allows you to be more mindful of the current moment and let go of any thoughts or worries about the past or future. This can help you find more peace and joy in your life.
