Lately, I've been feeling financially drained due to the economy and it's been tough for me. In addition to this, I'm trying to find a life partner to settle down with and start a family, which has been a challenge. Moreover, I'm dealing with a high demand from my students, who constantly bombard me with emails and questions.
I struggled with becoming angry and aggressive when triggered by certain situations. My counselor decided to test my ability to stay calm in those situations, by acting in a way that had caused problems for me in the past. But, she doesn't want me to hurt her.
I feel a bit upset because someone stole my shoes and I have no control over it. I'm not sure how to rationalize my thoughts about this situation.
I'm having trouble with someone close to me who doesn't respect my boundaries. I've told them that there are certain things I don't want them to do, but they continue to do them anyway. It makes me feel like they completely disregard my feelings, and it upsets me to the point where I feel the need to punish them.
I've been having trouble managing my thoughts lately, and I keep thinking that certain people in my life shouldn't have behaved in specific ways. I'm struggling to understand if my thoughts are logical or not.
I realized that previously I was living in a whole another world, but now, I have to think before I react to things, just like the wisdom of thinking you talked about. So, is there a recent time I got really angry?
I've been struggling with finding a job and feel discouraged. Recently I went through ten interviews, but none of the employers hired me. I feel like it's getting harder and harder for me.
As a patient, I feel like I have three strikes against me - my race, my gender, and my height. It seems like some people are prejudiced against me because of these factors. I can take care of myself, but it's still tough to face these challenges.
I've been facing unfair treatment lately, like a shoe stealer and bad employment interviews by parole officers. I don't like it, but I try to think of it as having lemons and making lemonade. However, I still struggle when someone really pushes my buttons or gets in my face. What should I do?
I feel like I'm constantly being pushed around, like a rat in a cage. It's hard for me to stand my ground and not let others' actions affect me. But I think I can do better and be in charge of my feelings.
I had enough control to avoid doing something I shouldn't, so I left the program for an hour to calm myself down. Despite my brief absence, I did not get into trouble because they understood my situation. I calmed myself down by walking around and telling myself that everything is crazy.
I've been looking for work since the end of February, and I just recently obtained a part-time messenger job, but it's not really where my skills lie.
I feel like my actions would have just gotten me back in jail and wouldn't have actually helped anyone, especially not my brother or my mother.
I used to be involved in drug dealing, even though I knew it was illegal. Knowing it was against the law didn't stop me from doing it.
As a patient, I feel like my past mistakes are affecting my present. I contributed to my own problems, but I wish ex-offenders like me were given more chances in life. It's disheartening to see how people of color are also treated unfairly, and it's like society doesn't give us much opportunity.
I don't believe this is happening. And I still cannot accept the fact that my brother is dead. I still cannot accept that fact but I had to realize that whatever I did - from that point on, it had to be something that my brother would want me to do. You know, 'coz he always wanted the best for me even though I took the wrong road and he didn't. He always, you know, stuck by me and kept telling me, 'Look, Melanie, you gotta get yourself together.'
Weirdly, I feel a little bit relieved; because it's the first time I've ever said it out loud.
Five years ago, my father left the military and started to struggle with anxiety, depression, and OCD. His mental health worsened to the point where one day, he suddenly got out of the car on a busy road and just started walking away.
I had a conversation with someone and they suggested that if someone asks to see a card, I should show it to them. However, I didn't say anything in response and remained silent.
I feel like I have let my son down because you didn't tell me what I needed to know. I really want to forgive you for that, but for some reason, I'm still holding onto it.
I'm feeling concerned for my friend's well-being, especially after all he's been through. I feel really sad for him, and I worry that he might not be able to live as long as he should.
I can accept why you felt so uncomfortable. But I can't accept that your protection of me and my children wasn't more important than that. I can't accept that you couldn't think past yourself and think about the bigger picture. And that's the bit that I can't get my head around. I am angry at you for not protecting my children and me. But I do accept the reason why, if that makes sense.
I didn't talk to my partner ahead of time about the cost of hiring someone for housework. He thinks I should do these things myself and that I'm very self-centered and selfish. The other therapist said the same thing, that I should do what I'm supposed to do, and things wouldn't be so bad.
I am an RN with a Bachelor's degree, and I have previously worked as a registered nurse in a hospital. I believe that I was doing a pretty good job and was a reasonably good nurse during that time.
Hi, I just wanted to say that I'm grateful to be here. I'm hoping to begin discussing the issues I've been experiencing.
My son, my mom, me, my sister, and my dad have all been affected by my dad's accident. It's weird that I mentioned my dad last, even though he had the accident. I don't mean that in a negative way, but it's because my dad is almost none the wiser due to his brain injury. He feels grateful to just be alive and it's really bizarre.
I may have overreacted to things because I'm bringing in lots of stuff from the background.
I have a great relationship with my dad because we laugh a lot. But recently, someone told me that they need me to not put them at risk again. I assured them that I never would, and I hope they trust me. However, I feel ashamed for not telling them how I feel.
I can only I only have like a month or so until I have to start college, so I have to start before I leave. It's scary and I guess it's just the matter upright but it's scary. I never really want to I never really wanted to admit that I had a problem. I'm not ready myself but I want to push myself to get it done.
I have been attending counselling sessions with my therapist, and everything seems to be going well. However, my husband doesn't want to use our insurance for the sessions as he doesn't want anyone to know about it. We haven't talked about the fee yet, but we're planning to discuss it in our next session.
I get that knot in my stomach again, and I feel like I want to grit my teeth. I felt really not like myself and it fills me with hate when I think about her.
Lately, I've been trying to understand my limits and abilities, and focus on drawing from those rather than constantly focusing on my weaknesses.
I'm not really feeling a part of my community where I live. It's a closed community, where there are people who have lived there for 15 to 20 years and are still considered outsiders. I've been living there for four years and I wonder how much influence it has on me.
I was just talking about how I would describe myself and the word 'rock' came up. However, I feel that sometimes being a 'rock' seems boastful.
Last night, I was with a friend, picking up papers around eight, nine or ten o'clock at night on a Sunday. We were trying to get the papers in the box, and my friend got a box next week.
I've had difficulties with my mother, but my dad has always been there to defend me and support me in whatever I need. I have really good support from him.
I was ready for a power struggle, but I eventually realized it worked better just saying what's important and what's not.
I worry about tomorrow, but I don't have to worry about that, I know. I know the scripture, and I have assurance, you know.
I'm the last born in my family, and my grandma was running out of names. My mother Jacky raised good kids, and I remember her saying something about it.
As a patient, one of my issues is really getting enough time to do everything. I have a two-year-old boy.
I remember it was dark and raining when I was at my mom's house. She always listened to old time gospel music and quartets, which I didn't really appreciate back then, but I somewhat appreciate now. It's not necessarily my cup of tea music, but it's southern gospel.
I've been working with kids for two years now and I've learned how to relate to them better. One of my teenagers even told me that they like how I don't talk like a social worker. I feel like I've accomplished a lot, but it hasn't been easy.
I moved to a small town with my husband where he grew up, for better schools and a quieter life. We started our family and made the adjustment, but I don't feel connected to the community. I'm not sure if it's my parents pulling me back or the familiarity of my old community.
I've been researching my family history and on my dad's side, we have checked back eight generations. As for my mom's side, it only goes back to four or five generations.
I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with my papers being all over the place, but I also find it amusing. I have a pleasant smile and am curious about the source of my happiness and its impact.
I am a licensed clinical social worker in California and I am in a rough situation right now. I'm transferring agencies after working for two years with seven families and their special needs kids who have psychiatric, behavioral, and emotional problems. I've worked with them weekly, visiting them in their homes, not the office. This setting has led to a very intimate relationship with the families.
I've been trying to help my friend who has been shoplifting food, eating it all, and then purging due to the guilt. She's a beautiful woman but her insides are suffering because of her behavior. We've tried working on not taking her backpack or wearing coats with pockets.
I've been helping a woman dealing with fear by having her carry a photo of someone she loves when she's out on the streets, so she can talk to that photo and feel safer. I think she's a wonderful person, but something in her life has made her fearful. It's hard for me to understand the diagnosis, but I try to come up with inventive solutions tailored to the individual.
I have never been married and I have two younger sisters. I am in touch with the second one, but we just talk. My family tries to stay out of my issues because they've been involved for so long and they maintain a distance.
I've noticed that my family invites my sister for holidays and she goes, but she feels that she's being punished.
I probably would want my friend to watch some movies that have humor and feelings of life, and then tell me about them to compensate for those times when she asks me to get up at 6:30 to see her. But I don't know if that's too big of an assignment.
I've been struggling with being physically active and exercise, and I feel like the goals are too big for me. This makes me just sit and contemplate instead of actually doing something. I need help with smaller goals.
I've been working with a woman who has depression and often doesn't follow through on tasks she starts. She feels guilty and like she's not meeting my expectations. I've tried giving her simple assignments to help, like planting nasturtiums to give her a small, manageable task. Sometimes I even adjust my schedule to meet with her at a more convenient time.
I have a 51-year-old patient who has seen other therapists before. She claims I am the first therapist who is willing to come in early and actually help her find a reason to live.
I believe my friend is an ethical person and treats others fairly. However, she has recently resorted to shoplifting as a way to resolve her emotional pain. What should I do?
As the patient, my elderly mother is on medicare and medicaid, and she has a monthly income of $649. She lives in low-income housing. One of her problems is stealing, and when I asked her to, she records instances of stealing and other situations that make her feel bad for me to read.
I was trying to get her to look at her own writing, to see her own imprint. I was thinking that she is only thinking about her problems, and her thinking isn't doing any good right now because it's all internal.
I've always been pretty anxious, and at first, using the trap made me feel more in control and confident. But now I have this constant knot inside me, and sometimes it gets worse.
I've experienced a couple of panic attacks, and it's really scary. I felt like I was going to die, and my heart was pounding in my chest. I also tend to get clammy during these attacks.
I've been having problems with my speed use. Recently, I've been getting in trouble at work, and my need for speed has become a problem. I'm also having fights with my boyfriend, and things are starting to feel out of control. These issues have escalated in the last five or six weeks. I've been using speed for a few years, but it became more frequent since I met my boyfriend six months ago who uses it a lot more than me.
I used to manage my speed use well in the past, but circumstances have changed, and now I am with a guy who uses more, which has led to an increase in my use as well. I work in a busy restaurant, and I've always found it stressful. Recently, I feel that I can't cope, and I'm forgetting things, like orders and concentration, which leads to chefs yelling at me, and I become snappy with customers.
Lately, I have not been managing my work as I usually do, and it's distressing me. Also, outside of work, I've noticed there have been a few problems with my boyfriend. We have been fighting a lot more, and I'm becoming increasingly worried about our relationship and its future.
Lately, I've been feeling really anxious and out of control due to my drug use. I don't want to give it up completely, but I want to be more in control and go back to the time when I felt I was managing things well. It used to serve a purpose for me socially and personally, but now the negative effects are starting to show. If I used less speed, I hope my anxiety levels would go down.
Lately, I've been struggling at work and feeling paranoid about my boyfriend when he's out. I know he's just doing his job, but I can't help feeling like he doesn't love me anymore and is going to leave me for someone else. It's causing me to constantly hassle him and my anxiety has been getting worse.
I've been feeling really edgy, and I was worried that I'd come in here and you'd say I had to give up my speed use, but I don't really want to. Can I feel better and still keep using?
I've survived my life by working all the time, and when someone asked me what I do other than work, I struggled to find an answer. I can't stop and always need something to do.
I've always considered myself a good soldier, fighting on, stubborn, and independent. But I've recently come to the realization that I can't do it on my own, and I don't like the idea of needing someone else's help. This is a new realization for me and it's been a long time coming.
I've been thinking a lot about our last session and I can't stop questioning my purpose in life. I remember we discussed it and I still feel lost and unsure about what I should do next in my life.
I've been struggling to stay in the present moment, and the more I try, the more tension I feel. I've noticed a reluctance in myself to be in the moment. For example, during the recent eclipse of the moon, I stayed up just to see it, feeling like I might never get another chance.
I feel overwhelmed by the responsibility I've been given, and I wish it had never come to me. I'm struggling with accepting that I can't change the past, and all I can do is decide what to do with the time given to me. I am dealing with a lot of grief, and I'd like to know how to handle it on my own, as I don't have many people to help me.
I experienced a beautiful sunset recently, and I had this strong desire to capture it and be with it. Yet, at the same time, there was this urge to turn away from it and go back inside, as if I would see it again some other day.
I know that it's about dealing with my emotions, but it's just really hard. There's a fear of being overcome by my emotions, like they might just overrun me and kill me. I have these conversations with myself, trying to be my own counsellor, but it goes nowhere.
I recently went for a walk and noticed different birds, but I couldn't identify all of them. I was just listening to their songs and it reminded me of our previous discussions about mindfulness.
I've recently become aware of a resistance to explore something that's been on my mind, and it won't go away. I feel like I'm being invited to face it, but I find myself evading it and experiencing tension. I'm torn between truly wanting to confront it and not wanting to at all, and this creates a physical reaction in me.
I recently lost a lot of my possessions and all that was left was just rubbish that nobody would have wanted or could have used. This has affected my life and my family's life.
As the patient, I've been feeling so much pain and regret lately. I keep thinking, 'if only I knew this before.' But I also wonder how much we can really know about someone else, even those we live with.
I feel so much pain from staying in this place, and I'm worried that it might drown me if I stayed with it. When people ask why I can't work my way out of it, I don't want to beat myself up about it, but I wonder why I can't.
I used to solve every problem that came my way, but now I can't solve this one. So, I escape into work, books, and theories. I can't stay in the present moment because that's when I feel my emotions and it feels like a tsunami. In the early days, I tried to find something to describe how it felt and saw the Japanese tsunami on TV, which perfectly represented my feelings.
I've been feeling exhausted lately, and it's like I'm in a never-ending cycle with my thoughts. It's difficult for me to express myself or find a different way out of this overwhelming situation.
I had a very long relationship with my partner, and I'm struggling with the depths of my grief. I can't let go of it, and I keep on running away. I've written about this, but this is one of the few times I've actually opened up, and I haven't died yet.
I've been through a lot in life, like having constant stress from not being accepted, worrying about my children and having huge phone bills. The leukemia diagnosis, although troubling, brought some relief as it allowed me to escape that environment, get a divorce and move to California. It has been a rough journey.
I feel like I gave up on being happy because I was always trying to live other people's lives and helping them, rather than focusing on myself. At the age of seven, I felt connected to the universe and felt a sense of wholeness, which I think I've lost now. I was drawn to the stars and felt it was my true calling, but I got lost along the way.
I've been struggling with living up to certain standards and it's making me feel frustrated. I wish I could go back in time and change things, but I know I can't. I think I've talked about this enough for today.
I feel that my seven-year-old self was more right than I am now. I wonder how that younger version of me would handle my current problems, like dealing with leukemia.
I've been feeling really controlled by society's standards, and it's been dominating my life. I feel like I can't trust my own instincts because I've been told they are childish. I'm a minority, and I feel like I'm a minority within a minority.
I find it extremely difficult to talk about my problems right now. I'm struggling to come to grips with certain things and it bothers me when I talk to my wife, who's far away, and hear what her mother thinks about our situation. I feel sick because of it.
I don't know. I was sitting in the room and waiting beforehand and I was thinking about when I was about seven or eight years old. I think that I've listened for so long to other people about who I was. I think I really conditioned, uh, to be something, uh, to be some kind of a symbol of whatever. And, uh, and not really being a person.
I used to think my illness was something that happened to me from the outside, but now I feel like I have some control over it from the inside. I've noticed that when I am positive and doing things I enjoy, I don't have any symptoms. The doctors wanted me to get transfusions, but I feel like I'm doing okay. I'm not exactly sure how I gained control, but I am convinced that I have it.
I think leukemia helped destroy the image I had of myself. When I was told I had four weeks to live, that was the end. I realized that being false to myself was more of a burden to me than the fact that I had leukemia. I was also worried about leaving my young, beautiful children behind.
I used to feel like I put myself in a difficult position because I had to take care of myself and be better than everyone else due to societal pressures. I didn't dare express my true self, especially about my illness, feeling frightened and uneasy. I did things I didn't want to do, like borrowing money and making up stories as to why I needed it. I didn't even tell my wife and family about my situation, and I always felt the need to be perfect.
I struggled a lot with my illness, especially having to hide my condition and needing help from others. It felt terrible telling people I have leukemia and I needed money, but it was hard to let go of my image of always taking care of others. This even cost me my family and children. Eventually, the illness made me understand that I'm just an ordinary person with problems like everyone else.
I was in remission and hobbling on a cane when I first came down here. I went on a motorcycle ride which was radical for me, but it was fun. I had been dealing with a divorce, losing property, and being part of a different race in my ex's family. I felt hurt by how people judged and treated me. This bitterness and being reminded of my race caused a lot of strain, and I want to get rid of these feelings.
I'd like to be able to tell you something that will make me feel good and help me continue to feel positive about myself, grow, and be nourished. But I'm really not sure what to say. I was really screwed by a lot of people, and I have reason to be angry. And I am angry, but I haven't said it yet.
I realized that my past experiences have influenced my approach to raising my kids. I don't want my children to bear the same burdens and negative image that I carried growing up.
I kind of missed out on my childhood and I've been through a lot of changes. Last June, I found out I had leukemia and was told that I had less than a year to live.
How should I comfort my parents when my grandmother passed away? I don't have much communication with my parents. Two days ago, my father informed me on WeChat that my grandmother passed away due to illness and asked me to go back next week to attend the funeral, but not much else was said. My first thought was that my mother must be very sad, but I didn't think to call first to comfort or something like that. It's been three days now, and there's been no communication between my parents and I. I don't know what to do, whether I need to care, and how to care.
When talking to strangers on the Internet or in reality, I will feel that there is no problem, after the past will always think about it in your mind, obviously the other party does not care anymore but still will be entangled, do not dare to interact with others, and do not know if there is a clear explanation is probably so. This problem has been bothering me for a long time, I don't know how to solve it, I want to ask for a help
Nowadays, it is often said that the emotional stability of parents has a profound impact on a family and on a child. Unfortunately and unfortunately, I was faced with parents whose emotional characteristics were: stubborn, controlling, resentful, irritable, and self-absorbed (they both complained and blamed each other, but these characteristics were particularly evident in both of them). Both of them were irritable, but they demanded that I had to accept their behavioral arrangements without thinking about whether it was reasonable for them to do so and whether it affected my normal study and work. (In particular, my parents were trying to control me with all kinds of brutal interventions after I became an adult in high school.) No matter how hard I tried to reason with both of them, it was all in vain. They brought me endless negative emotions. All I can do is running away from them, and I even feel like I have an aversion to the words they say, their perceptions, their behavior, and the stupidity they reveal. I feel that I have run out of words and I have lost patience to communicate with them. I have lost patience to communicate with them, because no matter how to reason with them, including arguing, they will not reflect.
There seems to be some evidence that not being loved, leads to death? Do you really need someone to love in order to live? This feels very bad, can't I live by myself? Can't I live by loving myself? Do I have to let someone else decide, do I have to let someone else like me
I know it's a clich to be sensitive to other people's opinions. But it does bother me quite a bit. As long as there is a little bit of feedback from others that makes me feel the element of judgment, my first reaction is to just blow up and dislike them back. Completely unable to calm themselves down. Anti-judgment feelings at the same time, but constantly to judge others, such as if a person can not do their own hands and cause me to work repeatedly, I will directly explode. It is said that the reaction to what is their own internal projection, but inside I actually do not worry about the views of others and difficult for themselves. I feel very conflicted and confused
Why do people get schizophrenia? What are the manifestations, can it be treated with counseling and how far can one recover? How long does it take and will doctors misdiagnose it when I go to the hospital. Thanks...
I saw a set of warm and healing books and also wanted to share them with a good friend to make her happy together. So on WeChat said I wanted to send her a set of happy, she neither refused nor said yes. Before placing an order, I told her that I placed an order, read it and lend me a look, and joked that this year's birthday gift will send this lazy. She also said no. Then the order was sent over. The two days asked her if it was convenient to receive the goods, her response was cold and indifferent. After receiving the stuff also angry with me, said how I thought it was a whole set, you occupy my place where I put? Let me take it away within one hour. I felt very uncomfortable and decided to cut off the relationship. Why can she be so completely unconcerned about other people's feelings only think about themselves? Is she living into a cool look or am I a fool asking for trouble?
Today, because I refused to do the chores in my mom's way, my mom said I wasn't even willing to do this little thing and I don't know what will happen in the future if I don't have their help. I was very angry when I heard that I wasn't unwilling to do it, I just wanted to do it my way and I usually do all kinds of chores. I rejected her method, but my mom said I was too cheap and said she didn't mean to attack me, but I obviously felt hurt because she denied all my abilities and every time something like that happened, my feelings were always denied and it was always me being too cheap.
My company is recently doing a project, the manager needs for external support. I happen to have such a resource, and he is a previous cooperator. Then he was introduced to the company. The boss is very fond of him, and from the HR side it came to the news that he also offered to do the company partner. But I do not feel very comfortable. I do not know what is wrong with me.
This problem has been bothering me for four or five years now. Whenever I go out, I want to go to the toilet or worry about not being able to find one. If there is a toilet next to me, it will be fine. I have been afraid to take a taxi, bus or plane for fear of wanting to go to the toilet. When I have to take a taxi, I can only take it for at most ten minutes, and I will be unconsciously nervous to go to the toilet after a long time or in a traffic jam. But on the high-speed rail where the number of toilet is limited, and I have to wait for hours. It has become so serious that it affects my normal life, and I am often afraid to go out. I am afraid to participate in even many entertainment activities. I do not know what kind of mental illness do I have? Is psychological counseling useful? I have been trying to relieve myself of this situation, but I still have help...
I'm irritable, forgetful, and sensitive. I do not know how to describe the current situation. I wake up every day unconsciously out of tears, and my heart is full of tangled helpless collapse, but I do not know how to express that pain. My memory is a little bad, but I can not forget that pain
After a counseling session at school, the counselor agreed with me to come back sometime this week, but I misremembered the time and was 20 minutes late, and by the time I got there the counselor had already left. Then there was always a very uncomfortable feeling that I had stood someone up, but there was no way to explain it to her because she didn't have counseling time later, and it felt hard, and it always made me feel like I was a bad person, and I felt that the counselor must have been angry with me, and I originally wanted to talk to her about this kind of similar problems, about my own mistakes that led to low self-esteem and self-criticism I had wanted to talk to her about the same kind of problems, such as low self-esteem and self-criticism due to mistakes I had made, as well as fear of relationships and social disorders, excessive concern for other people's opinions, and the feeling that people must hate me. But it's impossible to talk to her again, and I feel sorry and regretful that I have to re-establish trust and understanding again if I book another consultation. And I feel like I make mistakes all the time, and this feeling also makes me suffer.
I always dare not resist injustice. If others deliberately offend me, I do not dare to fight back or being retaliated against. If they quarrel with me, I will be nervous to do not know what to say.
Can a person who has established a stable ego live year-round without support and encouragement? There is a view that we need the support of others throughout our lives. So if a person with a good self-relationship can live all the time with a lack of support? Or does the ego relationship break down without someone around to support it
Perhaps because of personality reasons, friends around me love to share their things with me. I personally tend to be more relaxed when alone, and will not often share my own things to others, and I am not actually interested in other people's things. But every time a friend share with me, I will be polite to ask themselves and reply seriously even if I am not interested or even if it is very annoying, so that I feel very tired. At the same time it also strengthen the desire of my friends to share with me. Now basically every day from the moment I get a lot of messages, most of the time down the day I am returning messages, many of my plans are disrupted and particularly tired, what should I do?
I've read that intimate relationships are beneficial to physical and mental health, but how can people with Asperger's and autism mental disorders develop the ability to develop intimate relationships?
I'm 32 years old, always living with my parents, and now unmarried. Recently I had a boyfriend, and he said I have to live independently and I am immature. I think it is quite right, so I plan to move. My family also bought me a house, but I know if my mother will agree that I live alone or not, how to convince my mother?
I'm post-80s. My mom always dismissed me and never ended with encouragement or praise, no matter how I fed back or communicated. So I've always stayed away from her because it's stifling to stay together, and after a few days, I feel like crap. I'm powerless to change her, no matter what I say, she's still her, and no matter what I ask for, she still won't change. Outsiders say you have to understand, but why did I have to go through decades of this verbal violence?
The other day at home my mother was cooking and I was having a conversation. I suddenly saw my mother's face and forgot who she was...face to face communication is also very strange, as if I have never seen my mother's face. Yesterday, when I was making out with my boyfriend, I suddenly looked into his eyes and forgot what relationship I had with this man, and was very unfamiliar with him. I don't know him at all. I want to stay away from him. It's really embarrassing. I don't know how this happens so often
I want to be good and excellent. But when I'm with good people, I feel inferior and want to run away. I feel that I have very little discipline, I can't stick to it, I can't concentrate, and I easily give up halfway through everything. And in order to show my ability, I often exaggerate my half-baked skills to gain the attention and appreciation of others. I often behave in a nervous manner to cover up my shameful behavior
I don't know myself. For example, I like dogs and spent $2,000 on a golden dog. Within a day, I wanted to sell the dog. For example, I want to fight very well and want to gain the power to protect others. I then spent $4,000 to enroll in sparring classes. But then I found out that I really don't like sparring. So I was miserable and torn. I set my ideal side of myself on a high pedestal, but I didn't have the strength to do my ideal self. And yet I hate myself for not being able to achieve my ideal self. Every day is an internal conflict, do not know what to learn, what to do.
Whether it's a group chat or a private chat, why is it that when people don't respond to me anymore, I keep looking at the chat and waiting for others to reply. I reply to people no matter how busy I am. Sometimes, for example, at night, I just keep waiting and sleep. What should I do?
How can I tell if I really trust my counselor? I have been working with this counselor for over a year. Recently, I suspect that I may not trust her enough because of certain factors, including her training, appearance, etc., and I did not get a positive response from her after I had the courage to bring it up to her. At one point I suspected that she was not handling her self-exposure well and didn't dare to bring it up to her directly for fear that she would be sad. I would like to ask how to determine if I trust my counselor enough and if there are some basic guidelines? And how do I handle it and do I need to consider changing counselors? Thank you!
I have a very close friend. She was left with severe separation anxiety from her childhood, resulting in severe clinginess, lack of confidence, and needing me to keep tabs on her status. She even asks to share a bed with me and touch each other's bodies when we are both same-sex adults and have no homosexual tendencies. Personally, I am avoidant, so I felt stifled and uncomfortable. But whenever I objected to this, she would be extremely sad and unable to communicate. And this definitely gave her a second injury. I feel guilty, but I still don't think I should feel free to ignore my feelings. Now I am in complete conflict with her basic demands - she needs my attention and I want to have enough personal space. What can I do to improve this relationship, given the many attempts at communication that have not improved? I would like to help her reconcile with herself if I can, but if not, I would at least like to exit the relationship without causing her any harm
I am a self-tested as a BPD patient and hope to stabilize my emotions through medication. What should I do?
My wife wants to divorce, but in the process of getting it back I found out that she has been cheating on me for six months. I did not pick it out, and I am still trying. I love her and I think I must have unshirkable responsibility, but now she does not want to communicate with me, what should I do now?
I lived with my mother, but as I became an adult, I don't really understand her lifestyle. She was very demanding about housework. I don't feel dirty at all when she thinks the house is dirty. And she demanded that I clean in the way she did and often accused me of not cleaning. She often criticizes me with selfishness, saying that she shouldn't live in the world and that we should live separately and so on. She would also yell and cry, and could even cry three or four times a day. If I strongly resisted, she would do things like slamming doors and slapping herself. I remember when I was little she would even take a knife out and throw it on the floor, which cast a big shadow on me. Now I am very sensitive to her emotions and am afraid of her crying.
My mother was so controlling that she would be scolded if I didn't get her way; my parents had an extremely poor relationship, and quarrels and fights were common. I was insecure and the slightest thing would cause strong and persistent anxiety. I was so controlled by my mother that I had no motivation to socialize with others or to get married.
I have always believed in the existence of ghosts and monsters in the world, and I have been particularly timid since I was a child. I am now a senior in college, but if I sleep in a room by myself, I must turn on the light to illuminate the whole house. I'm also scared to walk in the dark by myself because I think night is the time when ghosts will appear. Not only is it dark, but I am also afraid of animals. Small dogs and cats that people on the other side like, but I feel that they may be aggressive to me. Especially puppies. I have been afraid of dogs since I was a child. When I grow up the fear diminishes, but it still haunts me. Also I am very sensitive to sounds and sudden movements in the silence. Especially when I am by myself, the slightest sound can make me feel like an enemy. I wonder if this is purely cowardly or because of a psychological problem?
I see that the power structure in my family is: my mother's relatives > my mother > my father and I. This gives me a very bad fantasy that my mother will exploit my father and me to serve my mother's family (although this does not happen or has not really happened in reality). From a moral and emotional point of view, one should not think this way, but my subconscious seems to think this way, so how can I understand this feeling and make adjustments?
