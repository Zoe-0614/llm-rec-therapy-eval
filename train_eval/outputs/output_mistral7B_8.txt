 Trust in a therapeutic relationship is subjective and complex, as it involves both emotional safety and effective treatment. You may consider the following signs of trust:

1. Feeling comfortable sharing vulnerable emotions and thoughts.
2. Believing your counselor understands and validates your experiences.
3. Confidence in their expertise and approach to therapy.
4. Consistently experiencing positive therapeutic progress.
5. A sense of respect and empathy between you.

If you suspect that trust is lacking, it's essential to discuss your concerns with your counselor openly and honestly. They may be able to address any misconceptions or provide reassurance. If the situation doesn't improve after addressing your concerns, consider seeking a second opinion from another therapist. Ultimately, the most important factor is whether you feel safe, understood, and making progress in therapy.

 It's important to recognize that your friend's behavior stems from her childhood trauma and severe separation anxiety. However, it's also crucial for both of you to respect each other's boundaries and needs. You can suggest seeking professional help together, such as therapy or counseling, to address her anxiety and promote self-reliance. If she is unwilling, consider setting clear limits on physical contact and personal space while maintaining emotional support through open communication. Ultimately, if the relationship continues to negatively impact your wellbeing, prioritize your mental health by considering a respectful separation.

 It sounds like you have grown up in an environment with a high level of control and criticism from your mother regarding housework and cleanliness. Her demanding behavior and emotional outbursts may be rooted in anxiety or stress, leading her to project her own standards onto you. Your sensitivity to her emotions is understandable given the intensity of her reactions. It would be beneficial for you to establish clear boundaries around household responsibilities and communicate your feelings of being criticized and controlled. Consider seeking individual therapy to process these experiences and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

It would be beneficial to explore these patterns in therapy to gain insight into how they impact your current life and relationships, and to develop strategies for increasing self-confidence and assertiveness.

 Based on your description, it appears that you are experiencing symptoms of a specific phobia or fear, known as "noctiphobia" or fear of the night, and "zoophobia" or fear of animals. These fears can significantly impact your daily life and cause anxiety, especially when you're alone. While it's natural for some people to have fears or apprehensions, if these fears are persistent and debilitating, it may be worth exploring them further with a mental health professional. They can help you understand the underlying causes of your fears and develop coping strategies to manage them effectively.

 It's common for childhood experiences to shape our perceptions and beliefs about power dynamics in relationships. Your description of your family power structure may be contributing to feelings of anxiety and fear that your mother will exploit you and your father. This is a complex emotion to process, and it may help to explore these feelings through therapy.

You can start by identifying the sources of this belief and examining how they influence your thoughts and emotions. It's important to remember that your subconscious thoughts don't always reflect reality. By recognizing and challenging negative thought patterns, you can work towards developing a healthier perspective on your relationships and reducing any associated anxiety.

Additionally, consider practicing self-care activities and setting healthy boundaries in your relationships to build confidence and improve your emotional wellbeing.
