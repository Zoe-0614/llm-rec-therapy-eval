 Schizophrenia is a complex mental health condition with no known single cause. It's believed to involve genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and disorganized behavior. Although counseling alone may not be sufficient, it can be part of an effective treatment plan in combination with medication and other therapies. Recovery is a unique journey for each person, but many make significant progress with the right support and resources. The length of recovery varies greatly, as everyone's experience is different. Misdiagnosis is possible, especially during the early stages or when symptoms are not fully expressed, so it's essential to advocate for yourself and seek a thorough evaluation by mental health professionals.

Your efforts to manage this issue are commendable, and it's clear that this concern has significantly impacted your daily life.

 While it's true that social connections and support can be essential for maintaining mental health, having a strong ego or self-identity doesn't necessarily mean one cannot thrive without constant external validation.

If you're unsure or have concerns, it can be helpful to discuss these feelings with your counselor openly. They may be able to provide reassurance or adjust their approach to better meet your needs. Ultimately, the decision to continue or change counselors is yours, but remember that trust takes time and effort to build. Keep an open mind and focus on the progress you've made so far.

 I'm glad to hear that you have identified your emotional experiences as being consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and that you are taking steps towards seeking help through medication. This is a significant first step in managing your emotions and improving your overall well-being.

Working closely with your healthcare provider, you can discuss the various medication options available for BPD and find one that suits your specific needs. Remember that finding the right medication and dosage may take time, so patience and persistence are key. In the meantime, consider practicing self-care activities such as mindfulness meditation, engaging in regular physical activity, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule to support your emotional stability.

Keep in mind that while medication can be an important part of managing BPD symptoms, it is not a cure-all solution. Therapy, particularly Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), has been shown to be highly effective for individuals with BPD. I encourage you to explore the option of therapy as well for comprehensive emotional support and skill development.

Your efforts towards seeking help through medication are commendable, and there is reason for optimism in your journey towards emotional stability. Keep taking one step at a time, and remember that progress may not always be linear but is still progress nonetheless.
