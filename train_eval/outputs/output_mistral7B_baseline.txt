 Anxiety attacks can be overwhelming and may make it difficult to engage in calming techniques like breathing exercises or counting. Instead, consider seeking support from a trusted person, such as your husband, who can help you through the experience. Remember, everyone's experience with anxiety is unique, so what works for one person may not work for another. Focus on finding effective coping strategies that work best for you in the moment.
*
 It's understandable to have concerns about balancing work and family responsibilities. You've made efforts to prioritize your children by working part-time. However, pursuing a career you're passionate about can bring long-term benefits for yourself and your family. Communicate openly with your children about your decision and reassure them of your love and commitment. Consider flexible scheduling or finding a childcare solution that works best for your situation. Remember, it's essential to find a balance between work and family life to ensure everyone's needs are met.
*
 It's commendable that you're striving for self-improvement and seeking your friend's assistance. This process can bring growth in your relationship. However, defensiveness is natural when being called out on behaviors that need changing. Try to view these moments as opportunities for learning rather than criticisms, and communicate openly with your friend about your feelings. Remember, the ultimate goal is personal growth.
*
 Identify the triggers that lead you to load the dishwasher in a particular way. Once recognized, try replacing your old habit with a new one, such as loading dishes mindfully without any specific pattern. Consistency is key, so make an effort to practice the new habit regularly. Seek support from family members or friends if needed, and remember that change takes time. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way.
*
 It's common for perfectionists to find it challenging to let go of tasks or accept imperfection. Your husband may have a different perspective on prioritizing tasks and accepting some level of mess. To regain control, try setting realistic goals, delegating tasks, and practicing mindfulness to stay focused on the present moment instead of dwelling on perceived imperfections. Communicate your feelings with your husband and work together to find a compromise that works for both of you.
*
 Relaxation isn't forced but requires intentional effort. Make it a habit by setting aside dedicated time each day. Try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation. Create a comfortable environment and avoid distractions. Remember, the benefits of relaxation include reduced stress, improved focus, and better overall well-being.
*
 It's understandable that you value good grades as a validation of your abilities. However, it's important to remember that grades aren't the only measure of success or intelligence. Feeling disappointed when not getting an A or when someone else outperforms you can be challenging. Try focusing on personal growth and learning instead of just grades. Setting the curve consistently is impressive, but remember that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on improving your own performance.
*
 Challenging activities, such as cleaning your husband's car, can help you manage anxiety by exposing you to discomfort in a controlled environment. Start with small, manageable tasks and gradually increase the difficulty over time. The frequency of these activities depends on your comfort level and progress. Consult with your counsellor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals. Regular communication with them will help determine the optimal schedule for you.
*
 It's encouraging to hear that your husband and his brother listened to your concerns about your mother-in-law's behavior and expressed support.

 It sounds like you are experiencing compulsions related to cleaning and controlling your husband's space, which may be contributing to anxiety. Here are some suggestions:

1. Practice progressive muscle relaxation or deep breathing exercises when feeling anxious about cleanliness.
2. Set realistic goals for cleaning and accept that perfection is not necessary.
3. Designate specific areas as "shared spaces" where both you and your husband have control, such as the living room or kitchen.
4. Respect each other's personal space by not interfering with items like cars unless there is a mutual agreement.
5. Consider seeking professional help from a therapist or support group to address underlying anxiety and obsessive-compulsive tendencies.
*
 It's natural for close friends to have differences and experience frustrations at times. You may value your work ethic highly, but it's essential to remember that everyone has unique circumstances and energy levels. Your friend works full-time and cares for her family, which can be demanding. Instead of focusing on her complaints, try empathizing with her experiences and finding common ground. Communication and understanding can help strengthen your friendship.
*
 I'm glad our conversations have been helpful to you during challenging times. Your past experience of facing a difficult situation despite its dramatics is commendable. Building bridges through communication can lead to positive outcomes.
*
 It's understandable to feel anxious when your mom's involvement in your children's lives doesn't align with what you desire. Despite infrequent visits, if she shows affection through gifts and regular contact, she is being engaged as a grandma. Consider discussing your feelings with her to find a solution that works for everyone. Regular communication and setting expectations can help alleviate your insecurities.
*
 It's normal to experience residual anxiety after letting go of stressors, but if it's impacting your sleep and motivation, consider seeking professional help. A mental health professional can provide you with tools and techniques to manage your anxiety and improve your sleep hygiene. In the meantime, practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation before bedtime, avoid caffeine and heavy meals close to bedtime, and establish a consistent sleep schedule. Remember that it's okay to ask for help when needed.
*
 It's normal to feel hurt when a friend doesn't attend an event we were looking forward to, especially if we believe they could have made it. However, it's essential to practice empathy and consider their perspective. People have various reasons for their actions beyond our control or understanding. In this case, prior obligations or work are valid reasons. If your friend didn't attend due to other reasons, try to communicate openly with them to understand their perspective. Remember that everyone has the right to make choices that may not align with our own.
*
 I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling lately. It's important to recognize when we're in unfamiliar or uncomfortable territories. This can be a sign of growth or a warning of potential harm.

*
 Anger can be a natural response, but if you're feeling confused after expressing it, consider reflecting on your emotions and the situation. Apologize if necessary and work towards resolving any misunderstandings. Regarding the six-hour shower, it may be an indication of procrastination or avoidance. Identify the underlying cause and address it to improve productivity.
*
 I'm sorry for your pain. While I can't provide specific details without knowing your personal situation, I can suggest some general areas to consider when trying to understand why Adam left.

Reflecting on these questions and perhaps speaking with trusted friends or a therapist might offer some clarity. Remember, it's okay to grieve and take time for yourself during this process.

1. Repetition: Repeat important information several times throughout the day.
2. Association: Connect new information to something you already know.
3. Visualization: Create mental images of what you want to remember.

Your doctor's advice to do as much as you can is important to maintain mobility and prevent further discomfort. Consider gentle activities like stretching or short walks to help improve flexibility and reduce pain. Additionally, prioritize self-care measures such as proper hydration, balanced meals, and adequate rest to aid in your recovery. Remember, it's essential to listen to your body and take things at your own pace.
*
 It's understandable that your concern for your partner's drug use may affect your relationship and potential legal issues. You have taken steps to improve yourself, but addiction is a complex issue. Communicate openly about your fears and offer support, but remember that you cannot control another person's actions. Consider seeking guidance from a therapist or support group to help navigate this situation. If safety becomes an issue, prioritize your well-being and involve law enforcement if necessary.
*
 I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's important to reach out to someone who can, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. If you're in immediate danger, please call your national suicide hotline. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and there are people who care about you and want to support you.
*
 I commend you for taking control of your life and quitting drugs and alcohol. It's understandable that living in the same neighborhood where old habits existed can be challenging. Leaving behind familiar people and places takes courage and determination. Focus on building a new support system, engaging in healthy activities, and staying committed to your goals. Remember, every day is an opportunity for growth and progress.
*
 I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed and concerned about your ability to care for your kids. It's natural to feel this way at times, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities. Remember, no one is perfect, and it's okay to ask for help when needed. Reach out to trusted friends or family members for support. Prioritize self-care activities, such as exercise or hobbies, to help manage stress. Consider setting realistic goals and breaking tasks into smaller steps to make them more manageable. Remember, you are doing your best, and that is enough.
*
 It's concerning that you've become reliant on a drug for energy. Over time, relying on substances for short-term gains can lead to negative health consequences and potential addiction. Instead of relying on drugs, try adopting healthy habits such as getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly to maintain your energy levels. If you're struggling, consider seeking support from a healthcare professional or support group. Remember, it's important to prioritize your long-term health over short-term gains.
*
 You typically wake up between 8-10 am and prefer afternoons due to being a night owl. Upon waking, you open the blinds for natural light to aid your morning routine.
*
 I understand that feeling unwanted acceptance from your peers can be challenging and negatively impact self-esteem. It's important to remember that everyone has unique qualities, and not everyone will appreciate or understand them. Focus on building self-confidence through positive affirmations, engaging in activities you enjoy, and seeking support from trusted individuals. Remember, it's okay to be different, and true friends will accept and value you for who you are.
*
 In solution-focused therapy, resistance isn't seen as a barrier but a form of cooperation. Scaling, where clients rate their progress on a scale, can help reduce overwhelm. Here's my suggestion: Create a scale with one end representing current positive achievements (e.g., seeing friends, cleaning to a satisfactory level). Place important goals at the other end. Encourage clients to focus on moving towards their desired end of the scale. This approach may provide a clearer path forward and reduce perceived resistance.
*
 A double bind occurs when an individual faces conflicting messages or expectations. In your friend's case, he may feel pressure to maintain the piles of newspapers and articles as a coping mechanism, while also wanting to live a more organized life to improve his mental health. To process this double bind with him, you could offer support and understanding, encourage open dialogue about his feelings and motivations, and suggest alternative ways to manage information that may be less overwhelming. It's important to approach the conversation with empathy and avoid judgment.
*
 Your interest in offering simple and least intrusive approaches is commendable. Solution-focused therapy (SFT) is an effective, goal-oriented approach that focuses on the present and future rather than dwelling on past problems. Milton Erickson's crystal ball technique is a unique SFT tool that encourages clients to visualize solutions they may not have considered before. This method can promote creativity, insight, and self-efficacy. Given your background in the Midwest where SFT originated, it seems like a well-informed and thoughtful therapy approach to pursue.
*
 It's important to respect an individual's privacy and autonomy in deciding when and how to come out about their gender identity. You can continue to be supportive by creating a safe space for open conversation, but avoid pressuring or forcing them to transition if they're not ready. Encourage them to explore resources, such as support groups or therapists, that may help them navigate their feelings and address any fears or concerns they have. Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and the timing and path of transition are deeply personal decisions.
*
 It's important to establish clear communication and expectations with your client. Ask open-ended questions to understand their motivations and goals. Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives together. Consider involving them in the decision-making process and providing regular progress reports. If necessary, explore potential consequences of not making the desired change. Offer support and encouragement throughout the process to help maintain their commitment. Regularly reassessing their progress can also provide valuable insights into their level of dedication.
*
 I'm glad to hear that our sessions have been helpful in clarifying your thoughts and aiding you in making decisions. The question-and-answer exchange allows for deeper exploration of your ideas, revealing new perspectives and potential consequences. This process can lead to more informed choices and improved problem-solving abilities. Keep in mind that continuous reflection and learning are key components in personal growth.
*
 I understand your dilemma. Keeping items related to your gender change journey can provide comfort and a sense of history, but clutter can also be overwhelming. To strike a balance, consider implementing a systematic approach. Sort through items regularly, keeping only those with significant emotional or practical value. Utilize digital storage solutions for articles and documents you wish to keep but don't need in physical form. This way, you can maintain a manageable space while preserving your connections to literature and personal growth.
*
 I understand that you are a 41-year-old transgender male in the early stages of your gender transformation process. Regarding your OCD tendencies, as an accumulator and saver, you may experience compulsions to collect or hoard items. This can lead to clutter and distress.

Seek support from a mental health professional if needed. Remember, it's important to prioritize self-care during this transition process.

Remember that it's okay to ask for help and that things can improve with time and effort. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

They may be worried, but their love for you remains unchanged. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when needed.
*
 I understand your frustration with a client who resists your suggestions despite your best efforts. It can be challenging when traditional approaches aren't effective. Before considering termination, consider alternative strategies. You might explore motivational interviewing techniques to help him identify and tap into his internal motivation for change.

If all else fails, seeking consultation from a colleague or supervisor may offer fresh perspectives. Remember, every client is unique, and what works for one might not work for another.

As for the girl you have a crush on, it's natural to be drawn to someone who makes us feel good about ourselves. Try to keep things in perspective and remember that others' opinions don't define your value as a person. Consider reaching out to trusted friends or a counselor if you need additional support.
*
 It sounds like you may be experiencing anxiety or fear that is not directly related to any specific situation. This can be a common feeling, especially when we are excited or passionate about something. Your stomach discomfort could be a physical manifestation of this anxiety.

 I understand your perspective. In our interaction, I provided detailed responses aimed at addressing your queries effectively and efficiently. This approach is consistent with how I would engage with a client in a professional setting. My goal was to ensure clarity and precision in our communication.
*
 Empathy towards colleagues' emotions is natural and can evoke similar feelings in us. The immediate fear they experience may be related to a current situation, whereas our fear could be future-oriented, as we contemplate the possibility of facing similar challenges as we age. It's essential to provide support and create a positive work environment that fosters resilience and mitigates these fears. Encourage open communication, offer resources and solutions, and promote self-care practices.
*
 I'm sorry for your loss. It's natural to feel unsure after experiencing such a significant event.

 You expressed fear about being content, yet found relief in voicing your satisfaction. Your anxiety stems from being satisfied. However, you take comfort in how you articulated your feelings. Overall, you are currently animated or expressive.
*
 I understand your compassionate feelings towards geriatric patients in long-term care environments. It can be challenging to find a silver lining when facing the harsh realities of their situations. However, focusing on their remaining abilities, past achievements, and personal stories can help humanize their experiences and bring positivity. Encouraging social connections, engagement in meaningful activities, and maintaining dignity can also provide bright spots in their daily lives. Remember, empathy is a valuable tool, but balancing it with hope and optimism can make a significant difference.
*
 I understand you use charisma to avoid answering questions during counseling sessions. However, your counselor remained unfazed by your tactics and pressed on with the session to ensure progress in your therapy.
*
 I understand your concerns about job security despite your impressive educational background and certifications. It's natural to feel anxious about the future, especially in today's rapidly changing job market. However, focusing on continuous learning and adaptability can help mitigate these fears.

Remember that having multiple degrees and licenses sets you apart from many other candidates and increases your employability.
*
 It sounds like past experiences have left you feeling wary of experiencing satisfaction due to fear of losing it. This can be a common reaction to disappointment or loss. However, it's important to remember that not all sources of satisfaction are fleeting. Focusing on building lasting sources of happiness and contentment can help mitigate this fear. Seek out meaningful relationships, personal growth, and activities that bring you joy. By investing in these areas, you may find that your satisfaction becomes more resilient over time.
*
 I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing fear and loss, following the passing of your parent eight years ago. Losing someone important can evoke strong emotions and leave us feeling disconnected, especially if that person represented a sense of security or "home." Grieving is a natural process, and it may take time to adjust to these changes. Consider seeking support from loved ones, therapy, or grief support groups to help you navigate this difficult period. Remember, it's okay to feel fearful and sad – allow yourself to experience these emotions while also focusing on the memories and love that will always remain with you.

 It's natural to experience fear about the future, especially with the uncertainty that comes with it. Fears can stem from various sources such as personal concerns or the larger societal context.

You might find it helpful to focus on what you can control and take small steps towards addressing your fears. Additionally, connecting with others and seeking support can provide comfort and perspective during uncertain times.
*
 I'm here to listen and support you. It's natural to feel afraid of losing control in life, especially with the many uncertainties we face.

To help manage your fear, consider setting realistic goals, practicing self-care, and building a strong support system. Remember that you have the power to make choices and take actions to shape your life. Together, we can explore coping strategies and ways to build resilience.
*
 It seems you're having difficulty expressing your feelings towards someone due to discomfort or unease.

*
 Certainly. It's natural to have difficulty separating a loved one's actions from their identity, especially when they have done something harmful. However, it's important to remember that people are complex beings, and their actions do not define them entirely. In the case of your husband, if he was not in his right state of mind, it may be helpful to consider the circumstances that led to his behavior and focus on his potential for growth and change moving forward. It can also be beneficial to practice forgiveness and compassion towards him while setting healthy boundaries to protect yourself.
*
 Understandably, it can be challenging to distinguish your worth from your actions during emotional moments. Remember, everyone makes mistakes and experiences setbacks. Focus on learning from your mistakes rather than dwelling on them. Practice self-compassion and remind yourself that you are more than one bad behavior or decision. Keep in mind that growth and improvement come from acknowledging and addressing shortcomings.
*
 I'm sorry to hear about the guilt you're experiencing. It's important to remember that your husband's problems were not caused by your marriage, but rather pre-existed it. You are not responsible for his emotional wellbeing, and it's unhealthy for him to make you feel guilty with the 'what if' game. Focus on maintaining open communication and seeking professional help for his issues. Your role is to support him, not blame yourself.
*
 It's natural to feel disappointed or sad when faced with difficult choices, especially if it seems like you might lose something desirable. However, it's important to remember that focusing too much on personal gain can limit your perspective.

Remember that sometimes making a sacrifice for the greater good or for someone else's benefit can lead to unexpected rewards or growth opportunities. Try to approach the decision with an open mind and a compassionate heart.

Consult with a medical professional or genetic counselor for advice on monitoring your children for early signs of FMF and available preventative measures or treatments. Stay informed about the condition to better understand how to manage it within your family.

 I understand. It can be a relief to receive a diagnosis when you've been feeling unwell and unsure of the cause. Knowing there is an explanation can provide a sense of validation and help alleviate anxiety or self-doubt. If you have any questions about your condition or need resources, feel free to ask.
*

If the pain persists, consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

Consider setting boundaries on what information she receives and from whom, while maintaining an open dialogue.
*
 I'm sorry for your loss. Grief can be a complex and isolating experience. Your definition of yourself is indeed shaped by your experiences and relationships, including the role of being a spouse.

Despite the challenges, you've shown remarkable resilience by becoming a fitness instructor – that's inspiring! Keep up the good work and prioritize self-care.

*
 I understand your feelings of guilt and self-blame. It's common for mothers, especially when comparing ourselves to others or dwelling on past decisions. However, it's essential to remember that no one can change the past, and focusing too much on it can hinder personal growth and happiness. Instead, focus on the present and what you can do now to improve your situation and relationships. Seek support from trusted friends, family, or a therapist if needed. Remember, being human means making mistakes – learn from them and move forward.
*
 It's natural for parents to want their children to cope well with challenging situations, but insisting on a specific perspective may add to your anxiety and potentially hinder your daughter's growth.

Remember that things may seem bleak now, but there is hope for a better future.
*
 It's understandable that you feel restricted by your mom's rules regarding your nighttime activities. You may want to express your feelings to her and suggest a compromise, such as extending your outing time or allowing more flexibility for socializing while still ensuring chores are completed. Communication is key in resolving this issue. If your mom is open to discussion, you can work together to find a solution that meets both of your needs.
*
 It sounds like there's a difference in perspectives between your mom and your step-dad regarding your freedom. Your mom may have concerns and wants to ensure your safety, while your step-dad is more lenient. You might try having an open conversation with your mom about your feelings and her concerns, and find a compromise that addresses both parties' needs. Additionally, focusing on improving your grades could be a way to show responsibility and earn more freedom.
*
 At age 16, you were caught with cigarettes by your mother who held a master's degree in special education. She didn't confront you immediately but made a comment later.

Your father, on the other hand, had an artistic influence and a more lighthearted relationship.

 I see you had a setback by needing to repeat your freshman year due to insufficient credits. You're close to sophomore status with just two more credits to earn.

Consider seeking help from a tutor for algebra and implementing better study habits and organization skills to ensure success moving forward.
*
 At age 11, I experienced my father's death in a car accident caused by drowsiness due to alcohol consumption. Although the amount was insignificant for intoxication, it instilled in me an aversion to drinking.
*
 I understand your preference. You're not judging your friends for drinking, but you personally don't enjoy the environment or smell associated with it. When they're under the influence, they become more relaxed and pleasant. However, you prefer socializing with them when they're sober.
*
 It can be challenging to discuss past experiences, especially when it involves seeking information from someone who may not have been deeply involved in your upbringing. While your mother's recollections may not be definitive, other family members or teachers could provide valuable insights.

 It sounds like you're experiencing resistance to being present due to anxiety or attachment to past or future events. Mindfulness practices such as meditation, deep breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce tension and improve your ability to stay in the moment.

Remember that being present doesn't mean ignoring the past or future, but rather bringing your awareness back to the current moment when your mind wanders.
*
 I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed and grappling with the past. It's natural to experience grief and regret in such situations. However, it's essential to remember that we cannot change the past, but we can control how we respond to it. Focus on the present and make the best use of your time. Engage in self-care activities like meditation, exercise, or hobbies to help manage your emotions. Consider seeking professional help if your feelings persist and interfere with your daily life. Remember that it's okay to ask for support when needed, but ultimately, you have the power within yourself to cope and move forward.

 It seems you've been coping with overwhelming emotions by immersing yourself in work, reading, or theories to avoid the present moment, drawing a parallel between your emotional state and the destructive power of a tsunami.

Consider seeking professional help if needed.
*
 I'm sorry to hear you're feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. It's important to prioritize self-care during times like these.

Despite the hardships, you've shown resilience and strength throughout your journey.
*
 It's understandable that focusing too much on others' lives can hinder personal happiness. At seven, you may have felt a deep connection to the universe and a sense of wholeness. This feeling of being drawn to the stars could be considered your true calling. However, getting lost along the way is common in life's journey.

*
 It's natural to reflect on our past selves and ponder how they might approach current challenges.

Younger children often possess resilience and innocence that can help them cope with difficult situations. They may focus on the present moment, rely on their support systems, and have a simpler perspective on complex issues. However, it's important to remember that everyone reacts differently to challenges, and there's no definitive answer to how your seven-year-old self would handle leukemia. Instead, consider drawing inspiration from their qualities of resilience and innocence as you face this challenge in your own way.
*
 I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling controlled and disconnected from your instincts. It's important to remember that societal standards don't define your worth or uniqueness. Trusting yourself and honoring your individuality can be challenging, but it's essential for personal growth. Embrace your identity as a minority within a minority, and seek support from communities that understand and validate your experiences.

*
 It's understandable that societal pressures can lead to feelings of self-imposed stress and the need to be better than others. Hiding your true self, including your illness, can be overwhelming and cause unnecessary hardships. Borrowing money and fabricating stories adds to this burden and can create complex situations. Keeping secrets from loved ones may provide temporary relief but can lead to long-term consequences. It's essential to prioritize self-care, communicate openly, and seek support when needed.
*
 I'm sorry to hear about your struggle with leukemia and the challenges you faced in revealing your condition and accepting help from others. It can be difficult to let go of the need to appear strong and self-sufficient, but it's important to remember that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

Expressing anger in a healthy way, such as through writing or talking to a trusted person, can also be beneficial. Remember, it's never too late to make positive changes and find sources of nourishment within yourself.

 It is unfortunate when parents exhibit emotionally unstable behaviors such as stubbornness, controlling actions, resentment, irritability, and self-absorption. These traits can negatively impact a family dynamic and hinder the emotional development of children. In my personal experience, I faced such parents who demanded unreasonable arrangements despite the negative effects on my studies and work. Their attempts to control me as an adult were brutal interventions that left me feeling drained and averse to their words and actions. Despite my efforts to reason with them, they remained unresponsive, leaving me with endless negative emotions and a loss of patience for communication.
*
 While there is some research suggesting that social connections and feelings of love can positively impact our physical and mental health, it is not accurate to say that a lack of love leads directly to death. People can and do live fulfilling lives without romantic or familial love. Self-love and self-care are important, but they do not replace the need for human connection. Ultimately, how we choose to live our lives is a deeply personal decision. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to whether or not we need someone else's approval or love to live.
*
 It's normal to be affected by others' opinions, but constant reactions of anger and judgment may indicate underlying insecurities or sensitivity. Instead of focusing on others' judgments, try focusing on self-improvement and developing emotional resilience. Remember, everyone has unique perspectives and biases, and not every opinion holds value or relevance to you. Practice responding calmly and objectively, even if the feedback is negative. This will help reduce feelings of conflict and confusion.

 While having a strong ego can provide personal stability and resilience, complete isolation from social support and encouragement may still pose challenges. Human connections foster emotional growth and help validate our self-perceptions. However, the extent to and frequency with which external validation is required varies among individuals.

Ultimately, the ability to live without constant support depends on personal strengths, coping mechanisms, and individual preferences.

 It's unfortunate that you've experienced consistent dismissal and lack of encouragement from your mother throughout your life. Your feelings are valid, and it's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being. While it may be challenging to accept, people cannot change fundamentally, and focusing on what you can control – your reactions and responses – is crucial. Seeking support from trusted friends or professionals can help process these emotions and provide new perspectives. Remember, your worth is not defined by your relationship with your mother.
*
 It seems you've experienced episodes of facial recognition failure during face-to-face interactions with familiar people, including your mother and boyfriend.

If it occurs frequently and causes distress, consult a healthcare professional for evaluation.
*
 It seems you struggle with feelings of inferiority around good people, which may stem from low self-confidence and difficulty sticking to commitments.

Instead, try setting boundaries for yourself, such as limiting your time spent checking the chat or focusing on other activities. If you're concerned about the communication, consider sending a polite message expressing your concern and giving them space to respond when they're able.
*
 Trust in a counseling relationship is subjective and can depend on various factors such as therapeutic alliance, emotional connection, and perceived effectiveness. If you're unsure about your trust in your current counselor, consider reflecting on the following:

1. Do you feel heard and understood by your counselor?
2. Have you experienced progress or growth in therapy sessions?
3. Can you share vulnerable information with her without fear of judgment?
4. Does she respond empathetically to your emotions and concerns?
5. Are there any ethical or professional concerns that make it difficult for you to trust her?

If you've answered "yes" to these questions, it may be worth continuing the therapeutic relationship. However, if you still have doubts or concerns, it might be helpful to discuss them openly with your counselor or consider seeking a second opinion from another therapist. Remember, trust takes time to build and can sometimes be challenged along the way.

Always take medications as directed by your doctor and report any side effects or changes in symptoms promptly.

 It's important to prioritize your emotional well-being in this situation. Acknowledge the pain and betrayal you're experiencing. Seek support from trusted friends or a therapist.

Focus on healing and moving forward, whether that's with your wife or separately.

 It seems you grew up with a mother who had high expectations for cleanliness and expressed intense emotions. Her demanding nature and criticism led to conflicts, causing distress and fear.

Additionally, your sensitivity to sounds and sudden movements could indicate an anxiety disorder or hypervigilance. Consider seeking support from mental health professionals to better understand and manage your fears.
