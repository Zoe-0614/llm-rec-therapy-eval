Reach out to trusted friends or professionals if you need additional support. Remember that it's okay to ask for help when needed.

 I'm here to help you make sense of your experience. It can be challenging when we have conflicting desires or emotions, especially when it comes to something as beautiful as a sunset. It's normal to feel a pull towards savoring the moment and also to feel an urge to retreat. This interplay between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors is common in all of us. Perhaps reflecting on what might be causing this inner conflict could help you better understand yourself and make a choice that feels right for you in that moment. Remember, it's okay to listen to both parts of yourself and make a decision based on what resonates with you the most.

Psychological counseling can be very helpful in managing these types of conditions. Through therapy, you can learn techniques to reduce your anxiety and improve your coping skills.

 While having a strong ego and positive self-relationship are crucial for emotional well-being, no one is entirely self-sufficient. Human connections provide us with valuable perspectives, support, and encouragement that can help us grow and cope with life's challenges.

Share how this move aligns with your personal growth and goals, while also acknowledging any concerns she may have. It may be helpful to involve her in the process by asking for her support and suggestions. Remember that it's important to approach this conversation with respect and understanding of each other's perspectives.

These experiences can be distressing and confusing, leaving you feeling embarrassed.

Remember that you're not alone in this experience, and seeking support can be an important step towards understanding and managing these feelings.

 I understand how difficult it can be to feel inferior around good people and struggle with self-discipline. It's important to remember that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and focusing on self-improvement rather than comparison to others can be more productive. Practicing self-compassion and setting realistic goals with small steps can help build discipline and concentration.

 I understand how difficult and frustrating it can be when we feel ignored or disconnected from a conversation. It's natural to want validation and connection through communication with others. However, constantly checking the chat without receiving a response may contribute to feelings of anxiety or stress.

Additionally, practicing self-care and engaging in activities that bring you joy can help improve your mood and reduce the need for external validation. Remember, everyone has their own pace and it's important to respect that while also taking care of yourself.
*
 I understand that trust is an essential component of the therapeutic relationship, and it's natural for you to question your feelings towards your counselor. Trust can be built on various factors, such as feeling heard, understood, respected, and safe. It may not always be about your counselor's training or appearance but more about their ability to create a supportive and non-judgmental environment.

Regarding your recent experience, it's important to communicate openly with your counselor about your concerns. Trust is a two-way street, and expressing your feelings can help deepen the connection between you both. If you feel that you are not being heard or understood, consider sharing specific examples of how you feel this way and asking for clarification or reassurance.

It's also essential to evaluate if the counseling sessions are helping you in some way, even if it's not always in a way that feels immediately positive. Trust takes time to build, and it may not always be a linear process. If you feel stuck or unsure, consider discussing your concerns with your counselor or seeking a second opinion from another mental health professional. Ultimately, the decision to continue or change counselors is a personal one, based on what feels right for you and your unique needs.
*
 I'm here to support you through this challenging situation. It's important to remember that both of you are experiencing valid emotions and needs. Your friend's separation anxiety stems from past experiences, and her clinginess is a coping mechanism. You, on the other hand, need personal space to feel comfortable.

You've tried communicating your feelings, but it hasn't led to resolution. It might be helpful to seek outside assistance, such as a therapist or counselor, who can facilitate a productive conversation between you both. They can help your friend understand her emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms while respecting your boundaries.

If therapy isn't an option, consider setting clear limits with your friend about what behaviors are comfortable for you. Be empathetic and understanding when expressing your concerns, but also be firm in maintaining your personal space. Remember that it's okay to prioritize your emotional well-being.

If the relationship cannot improve despite your efforts, ending it may be the best option for both of you. Ensure that the separation is done gently and with sensitivity towards your friend's feelings, as you don't want to cause any further harm.

 I'm sorry to hear that you have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and are seeking stability through medication.

Regarding her criticism and emotional outbursts, I can imagine how scary and overwhelming that must feel for you. It's essential to set healthy boundaries and communicate your feelings clearly and respectfully.
