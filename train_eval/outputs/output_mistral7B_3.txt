 I understand your dilemma, which seems to be about balancing the need to declutter and let go of items that may hold emotional significance related to your gender change journey, while also fearing the potential loss of valuable connections to literature and articles.

One solution could be to adopt a mindful decluttering approach, where you take your time sorting through each item, assessing its value and deciding whether it's worth keeping or not. Consider using storage solutions like boxes or binders for sentimental items that you can't part with yet but don't want to clutter up your living space.

Another option is to digitize articles and documents that hold emotional significance, so you can keep them easily accessible while freeing up physical space. You could also consider setting aside a dedicated space for these items in your home, if possible. Ultimately, the best solution will depend on your personal preferences and priorities.

Here's a potential plan:
1. Set aside time each week to sort through one area or category of items.
2. Use a three-bin system (keep, donate/sell, discard) to make decisions about each item.
3. For sentimental items related to your gender change journey, consider digitizing them or setting aside a dedicated space for them in your home.
4. Take breaks as needed and be gentle with yourself throughout the process.

 Of course, I can help you explore this further. It's natural to have difficulty separating your husband's actions from his identity, especially when those actions caused harm.

Finally, develop a plan of action for implementing your chosen solution, and be open to re-evaluating as new information arises.

 Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder with no known single cause. A combination of genetic, environmental, and developmental factors are believed to contribute. Manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and disorganized behavior. While counseling can provide support, it's not typically an effective treatment for schizophrenia. Instead, antipsychotic medication is the standard of care. Recovery varies greatly from person to person, with some able to live relatively normal lives with proper treatment. Misdiagnosis is possible, especially in the early stages or if symptoms are mild, so it's important to be thorough and seek a second opinion if you have concerns.
