 I understand how frustrating it can be when traditional anxiety management techniques don't seem to work for you in the moment. It's important to remember that everyone's experience with anxiety is unique, and what works best may vary from person to person.

You may also want to consider working with a mental health professional who can help you develop a personalized anxiety management plan based on your specific needs and experiences.

 I understand how frustrating it can be to slip back into old habits despite making progress. It's important to remember that changing behaviors takes time and practice. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Identify the trigger: What caused you to go back to your old habit today? Was it stress, tiredness, or a specific situation? Understanding the root cause can help prevent similar situations in the future.
2. Reframe your thinking: Instead of focusing on the end goal of loading the dishwasher perfectly, try shifting your mindset towards the process itself. Remind yourself that there is no right or wrong way to load a dishwasher as long as it gets done.
3. Set small goals: Break down your goal into smaller, manageable steps. For example, focus on loading one section of the dishwasher correctly before moving on to the next.
4. Practice mindfulness: Be present in the moment and focus on the task at hand. When you notice yourself slipping back into old habits, gently remind yourself of your goal and refocus on the present.
5. Seek support: Share your progress and setbacks with a friend or family member who can offer encouragement and accountability. Consider joining a support group or seeking professional help if needed.

2. Find a buddy: Share your goals with a friend or family member and ask them to check in on you.

Choose the option that resonates with you most, and consider seeking the help of a therapist or trusted friend to provide guidance and encouragement throughout this process. Remember, it's never too late to reclaim your identity and live authentically.

 I understand how difficult it can be to find something that makes us feel good and nourished when we've experienced hurt and anger.

One solution could be to reach out to your father and express your condolences directly. You can acknowledge the loss and offer your support, even if it's just virtual for now. If you're unsure about what to say or how to approach the conversation, consider writing a heartfelt message that you can send through WeChat.

One solution could be limiting your interactions with them, while still maintaining essential contact. This may involve setting clear communication rules and sticking to them. For example, you could establish specific times for conversations and avoid discussing sensitive topics that lead to arguments.

Another option could be seeking outside support, such as a family therapist or counselor. They can provide guidance on effective communication strategies and help mediate discussions between you and your parents.

 I understand that feeling deeply connected and loved by others is important for many people. However, it's essential to recognize that everyone's needs and experiences are unique. While having love and connections with others can bring joy and fulfillment to our lives, it's also possible to live a meaningful life without it. Loving yourself unconditionally is crucial, as it provides a strong foundation for self-worth and resilience. You don't have to rely on someone else's validation or acceptance to determine your worth or value. Developing a plan that focuses on self-care, personal growth, and building healthy relationships can help you navigate these feelings. Remember, everyone's journey is different, and it's essential to find what works best for you.
*
 I understand how challenging it can be to deal with feelings of sensitivity to criticism and the resulting anger. It's important to recognize that everyone has the right to their own opinions, even if they may not align with ours. Your reaction might be a defense mechanism, an internal projection of your own insecurities or fears.

One solution could be practicing self-compassion and mindfulness. This means being kind to yourself when faced with criticism, acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes, and focusing on your own thoughts and emotions instead of getting caught up in what others may think.

Another option could be setting clear boundaries with those who consistently provide negative feedback or judgment. Communicate calmly and assertively about how their words affect you and ask for respectful communication.

Consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor to explore these feelings further and develop coping strategies tailored to your unique situation. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your emotional well-being and work towards healthier relationships with others.

 I'm here to support you through this challenging time. Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that currently has no known cause. Research suggests a combination of genetic, environmental, and brain development factors may contribute. Manifestations can include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking or speech, and abnormal behaviors. Treatment often includes medication to manage symptoms, along with therapy like counseling or psychotherapy for skills training and emotional support. Recovery is a personal journey and progress varies from person to person. Some people may make significant improvements, while others may continue to experience symptoms to some degree. Misdiagnosis can occur due to the complexity of schizophrenia's symptoms, so it's important to work closely with healthcare professionals to ensure an accurate diagnosis. I understand how scary and overwhelming this information can be. Please know that you are not alone, and there are resources available to help you navigate your journey towards better understanding and managing your mental health.

 I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling hurt and confused by your friend's behavior in this situation. It can be difficult when we try to make someone else happy and they don't seem to appreciate it or even react negatively. It's important to remember that people have different ways of expressing themselves, and sometimes their reactions may not match what we expect or hope for. Your friend's indifference and anger might be a reflection of her own emotions, stressors, or preoccupations at the moment, rather than a deliberate disregard for your feelings.

To move forward, you could try to approach this situation from a place of curiosity and empathy, rather than judgment. You might consider reaching out to your friend to express your concerns and ask if there's anything going on that's causing her to seem distant or unresponsive. It's also possible that she may not have realized the impact of her actions on you, so opening up a dialogue could help clarify things.

If, after trying this approach, you still feel uncomfortable in the friendship, it might be best to take some time for yourself and consider whether continuing the relationship is beneficial for both parties. It's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and surround yourself with people who value and respect you.

Regarding the question of why she seems so unconcerned about other people's feelings, it's essential to remember that this behavior may not be a reflection of her character as a whole. People can have complex emotions and motivations, and this situation might be an anomaly rather than a pattern. It's crucial to avoid making assumptions based on one incident and instead focus on the specific dynamics at play in your friendship.

 I understand how frustrating and hurtful it can be when your mom dismisses your intentions and abilities.

1. Reflect on what specifically makes you uncomfortable about working with this individual again. Is it their past behavior, the potential conflict of interest, or something else?
2. Brainstorm solutions. Could you suggest other candidates for the project, or discuss your concerns with your manager and HR?
3. Evaluate the pros and cons of each solution. Consider the potential outcomes, both positive and negative, for each option.
4. Choose the best option based on the information gathered in the previous steps.
5. Develop a plan to implement your decision. This might include communicating with your manager or HR, setting clear boundaries, or seeking additional support if needed.

 I'm sorry to hear that you've been dealing with this issue for a few years now and it's significantly impacting your daily life. Based on the symptoms you described, it sounds like you may be experiencing Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or a related condition called Bladder Pain Syndrome. These conditions can cause frequent urges to use the bathroom and anxiety around not being able to find one when needed.

Psychological counseling can be very helpful in managing symptoms of IBS or similar conditions. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common approach used to help individuals learn coping skills for managing the physical symptoms and reducing anxiety related to using the bathroom in public. Additionally, relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation can be helpful in managing stress and anxiety.

It's important to work with a healthcare professional or therapist to develop a personalized plan that addresses your specific needs. They may recommend medications, dietary changes, or other treatments in addition to counseling to help manage your symptoms effectively. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and take steps towards improving your quality of life.
*
 I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling irritable, forgetful, and sensitive, and that you're experiencing deep emotional pain that's hard to put into words. It sounds like you're going through a very challenging time.

One possibility for addressing your symptoms could be exploring the root cause of your emotional pain. This might involve talking with a mental health professional or trusted friend or family member, and working through any underlying issues together.

Another option could be practicing self-care activities that help you manage stress and improve your mood. This might include things like getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising regularly, engaging in hobbies or creative pursuits, and finding ways to relax and unwind.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it, and that healing takes time. Be gentle with yourself as you work through this experience, and know that there are resources available to support you along the way.
*
 I'm really sorry to hear that you missed your counseling appointment and have been feeling badly about it ever since. It's understandable to feel regret and discomfort when we don't keep commitments, especially ones related to our mental health. However, it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and being late to an appointment doesn't make you a bad person.

One possible solution could be to leave a sincere apology message for the counselor explaining what happened and expressing your regret. If you feel comfortable, you could also ask if there is a chance to reschedule in the future. In the meantime, try practicing self-compassion and forgiveness, recognizing that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay to not be perfect.

Additionally, you mentioned feeling low self-esteem, self-criticism, fear of relationships, social anxiety, excessive concern for others opinions, and a fear that people hate you. It's important to address these feelings as well. Consider engaging in activities that help build self-confidence, such as practicing positive self-talk, setting small goals and achieving them, or seeking out supportive relationships. Remember, it takes time and effort to build self-esteem and overcome negative thought patterns, but with persistence, you can make progress.
*
 I understand that you've been feeling powerless and anxious when faced with injustice or conflict. It's important to recognize these feelings and validate your experiences. One solution could be practicing assertiveness skills, such as setting clear boundaries and expressing yourself calmly and respectfully.

Ultimately, the best choice will depend on what feels most comfortable and sustainable for you. Let's explore these options further and develop a plan that works best for you.

 While it's true that many people find support and encouragement from others essential for their emotional wellbeing, some individuals may be able to maintain a stable ego and live independently year-round. However, it's essential to acknowledge that everyone's experiences and needs are unique. A strong self-relationship can provide significant resilience, but isolation could potentially lead to feelings of loneliness or disconnection. Consider exploring alternative ways to connect with others, such as joining a community group or engaging in online forums related to shared interests. Ultimately, the best approach depends on your specific circumstances and personal preferences.
*
 I understand how exhausting it can be to constantly receive and respond to messages about shared items, even when you're not interested. It's important to set healthy boundaries that respect your energy and time. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Express your feelings: Politely let your friends know how their sharing habits affect you and ask for their understanding.
2. Set clear boundaries: Communicate that while you appreciate their thoughtfulness, you prefer not to engage in lengthy conversations about shared items when you're busy or have plans.
3. Use automated responses: Consider setting up an out-of-office message or using a messaging app feature to respond automatically to certain types of messages.
4. Prioritize your time: Be selective about the messages you respond to and focus on important relationships and commitments.
5. Practice self-care: Make sure to prioritize activities that recharge your energy, such as hobbies or spending time alone.

 I understand that developing intimate relationships can be challenging for individuals with Asperger's and autism due to social communication difficulties. However, it is important to remember that everyone's experience is unique, and there are strategies that may help. One approach could be practicing social skills through therapy or support groups. Learning how to read nonverbal cues, understanding sarcasm and humor, and improving active listening skills are essential. Additionally, considering visual aids, such as social stories or scripts, can provide structure and clarity in social situations. Building friendships first and gradually working towards more intimate relationships may also be helpful. Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace, and seeking professional guidance is an important step towards growth.
*
 I'm here for you, and I understand how difficult it can be to face criticism from a loved one, especially when it comes to something as personal as living arrangements. It's natural to feel hurt and unsure of how to move forward. Regarding your plan to move out, it's essential to have open and respectful communication with your mother about your desire for independence. You might consider sharing your feelings and explaining why this step is important for your personal growth. Offer reassurance that you will still be there for your family when needed. If she expresses concerns, listen carefully and work together to find solutions that address both of your needs. Remember, it's essential to approach the conversation with empathy and respect.
*
 I'm really sorry to hear that you've had to endure decades of dismissive and unsupportive behavior from your mother. It's completely normal for you to feel frustrated, powerless, and even sad about the situation. While it may be difficult to change someone else's behavior, focusing on what you can control can help improve your emotional well-being. Consider setting boundaries around your interactions with your mom, such as limiting contact or finding healthy ways to cope with her criticism. Seeking support from trusted friends or a therapist can also provide valuable perspective and tools for managing these challenging emotions. Remember, it's important to prioritize your own mental and emotional health above trying to change someone else.
*
 I'm here for you and I can understand how confusing and distressing these experiences must be for you. It sounds like you're dealing with some memory lapses during important moments in your personal relationships. This could be a sign of stress, anxiety, or even a more serious condition such as Alzheimer's disease or dementia. I would recommend discussing this issue with your doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions. In the meantime, try practicing mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing and meditation to help improve focus and memory during conversations. Additionally, consider keeping reminders around you, like photos or notes, to help jog your memory when interacting with loved ones. Remember, it's important to take care of yourself both physically and emotionally, and seeking professional help is a brave and necessary step towards understanding and addressing this issue.
*
 I understand that you feel a strong desire to be good and excellent, yet you experience feelings of inferiority when around good people. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and explore the underlying causes. One possibility is that you may have internalized a belief that being good or excellent means being perfect, which can lead to self-criticism and feelings of shame.

To address this issue, consider focusing on progress rather than perfection. Break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps and celebrate each accomplishment along the way. Developing discipline and concentration can be challenging, but there are various techniques that may help, such as setting clear priorities, establishing a routine, and practicing mindfulness meditation.

Exaggerating your skills to gain attention and appreciation is a coping mechanism, but it ultimately undermines trust and authenticity in relationships. Instead, try to be genuine and open about your strengths and weaknesses. And remember that everyone makes mistakes and experiences setbacks – it's a natural part of the learning process.

In developing a plan, start by setting realistic goals, creating a supportive environment, and practicing self-compassion. Seek out resources, such as books, articles, or workshops, to learn new skills and strategies for building discipline and confidence. And remember that progress may be slow at times, but every step forward is a step in the right direction.

 I understand that you're feeling lost and confused about your desires and actions. It can be difficult when we set high ideals for ourselves but struggle to meet them. It's important to remember that it's okay not to have everything figured out yet.

Regarding the dog, perhaps consider exploring why you felt the need to buy it in the first place. Was it an impulse purchase or did you truly believe it aligned with your ideal self? If it wasn't a good fit, selling it may have been the best decision for both you and the animal.

Similarly, with the sparring classes, maybe there are other ways to express your desire to protect others that align more closely with your interests and strengths. Brainstorming alternative options could help alleviate the internal conflict you're experiencing.

Lastly, be kind to yourself during this process. It takes time and effort to discover who we truly are and what makes us happy. Allow yourself the freedom to explore different paths without judgment.
*
 I understand how difficult and frustrating it can be when we expect a response but don't receive one. It's natural to want validation and connection from others, especially through communication channels like group chats. However, it's important to recognize that sometimes people are busy or preoccupied, and may not be able to respond right away.

One solution could be to set boundaries for yourself around checking the chat. For example, you could designate specific times during the day to check the chat and respond to messages. This can help reduce the urge to constantly check the chat and give you more control over your time.

Another option could be to reach out to individuals in the group chat directly if you have something important to discuss or need a response from them. This can help foster deeper connections and make communication feel more personal.

Lastly, it may be helpful to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that everyone experiences busy periods and that waiting for a response doesn't reflect on your worth or value as a person. Remember that you are important and deserving of attention and connection, even if others may not always be able to provide it in the moment.
*
 I understand that trust is an essential component of a successful therapeutic relationship. It's natural for doubts or concerns to arise at times, especially when we feel that something isn't quite right. Based on your experience, here are some suggestions for determining if you truly trust your counselor:

1. Reflect on the therapeutic alliance: Consider how comfortable you feel sharing personal issues with your counselor, their ability to understand and validate your experiences, and their responsiveness to your needs.
2. Evaluate their competence: Research their qualifications, licenses, and certifications to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to address your concerns.
3. Communication is key: Express your concerns openly and honestly in a respectful manner, and observe how your counselor responds. A good therapist will listen attentively, acknowledge your feelings, and offer reassurance or solutions.
4. Self-reflection: Examine the root cause of your mistrust. Is it based on facts or emotions? Be honest with yourself about what you truly want from therapy and whether your counselor can help you achieve those goals.
5. Consider seeking a second opinion: If your doubts persist despite addressing them directly with your counselor, it may be worthwhile to consult another therapist for a fresh perspective. Remember that finding the right fit takes time and patience.

Ultimately, trust is built over time through consistent effort from both parties. If you feel that your current counselor isn't meeting your needs, it's essential to address your concerns directly and honestly while keeping an open mind for potential solutions.
*
 I understand how complex and challenging your situation is. It's important to remember that your friend's behavior stems from deep-rooted anxiety and a need for comfort, which may not be related to romantic feelings towards you. However, it's also crucial for both of you to respect each other's boundaries and personal space.

One potential solution could be to explore professional help together, such as therapy or counseling. This can provide your friend with the tools she needs to manage her anxiety and learn healthier ways to cope. You can offer your support and encourage her in this process.

Another option is setting clear boundaries in the relationship. Communicate openly about what makes you feel uncomfortable and propose alternatives that meet both of your needs, such as regular check-ins or shared activities that don't involve excessive physical contact. Be firm but compassionate during these conversations.

Lastly, if the situation doesn't improve despite all efforts, it may be necessary to consider ending the relationship. It's essential to do so in a caring and understanding manner, ensuring that your friend is supported throughout this transition. Encourage her to seek professional help and continue working on her personal growth.

 I'm sorry to hear about the painful discovery you've made and the challenging situation you're in. It's natural to feel confused, hurt, and desperate to save your marriage. However, it's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being and safety. Communication is key; try reaching out to her again with a calm and non-confrontational tone, expressing your feelings and your desire to work things out. If she continues to refuse communication or shows no interest in reconciliation, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor to process your emotions and explore your options moving forward. Remember, it's important to take care of yourself during this difficult time.
*
 I'm here to support you through this challenging situation with your mother. It sounds like there is a significant disconnect between your cleaning habits and your mother's expectations, leading to frequent conflicts and criticism. It's important to acknowledge that everyone has different ways of keeping their living space clean and that it's okay if yours don't align perfectly with your mother's.

To address this issue, you could consider setting clear boundaries around household chores while also finding compromises that work for both of you. For instance, you might suggest a cleaning schedule or hiring outside help to share the load. Communication and compromise are key in resolving these tensions.

Additionally, it's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being. If her criticisms or emotional outbursts become too overwhelming, consider setting aside time for self-care activities or seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional. Remember that you deserve respect and kindness in your living environment, even if it may not always be present from your mother.
*
 I'm here for you, and I can only imagine how challenging it must have been growing up in such a volatile environment. It's not uncommon for individuals in similar situations to experience feelings of anxiety and insecurity.

One potential solution could be seeking therapy to help process the past and develop coping mechanisms for current anxieties.

 I understand that you have had a lifelong fear of the dark, ghosts, monsters, and animals, particularly dogs. These fears can be distressing and impact your daily life. It's essential to acknowledge that experiencing fear is a normal human emotion, but when it significantly impairs your quality of life, it may be helpful to explore its roots.

Your fears could stem from past experiences or genetic predispositions. However, it's also possible that these anxieties are exacerbated by psychological factors such as an overactive imagination or avoidance behaviors. It's crucial to remember that you're not alone in dealing with these feelings.

To help alleviate your fears, consider the following steps:

1. Exposure therapy: Gradually expose yourself to situations that trigger fear, starting with small steps and gradually increasing the intensity. For example, start by turning off the light in a room while you're still awake or spending time in a dimly lit area.
2. Mindfulness meditation: Practice mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation to help calm your mind and body.
3. Cognitive restructuring: Challenge negative thoughts and replace them with positive, realistic ones. For instance, remind yourself that most dogs are friendly and would not harm you.
4. Seek professional help: If your fears continue to interfere significantly with your daily life, consider seeking the assistance of a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or therapist. They can provide guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.
*
 I'm here to support you as you navigate through your feelings. It sounds like you have an unconscious fear that your mother may prioritize her family over yours, leading to a sense of exploitation. This fear may be rooted in the power dynamics within your family. It's essential to acknowledge these feelings and understand their origins.

One way to address this issue is by practicing healthy communication with your parents about your concerns. Share how you feel without blaming or accusing anyone. You could also explore the root of this fear by reflecting on past experiences that may have contributed to these thoughts.

Another option is to focus on building a strong bond with your father and work together to establish equal footing within the family dynamics. This can help strengthen your sense of security and reduce feelings of exploitation.

Lastly, consider seeking therapy or counseling to gain further insight into these emotions and develop coping strategies. Remember, it's okay to feel these emotions, but it's essential to address them in a healthy way that promotes growth and understanding within your family.
