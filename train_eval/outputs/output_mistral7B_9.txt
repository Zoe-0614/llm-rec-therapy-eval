 I understand how challenging it can be to deal with the feelings of being judged by others, especially when it triggers strong reactions in you. It's important to recognize that everyone has their own perspectives and biases, which may not always align with ours. While it's natural to want to defend ourselves when we feel attacked, it's essential to take a moment to pause and reflect before reacting. This can help us respond in a more thoughtful and productive way.

Working on developing self-compassion and self-acceptance may help reduce the need to constantly judge others and ease the anxiety around being judged ourselves.

 Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that currently has no known cause. Research suggests a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute. Manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and disorganized or abnormal behavior. While counseling can help manage symptoms and improve coping skills, it's typically not enough on its own to treat schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medication is often necessary for effective management. Recovery varies greatly from person to person, with some making significant progress while others may continue to experience symptoms throughout their lives. Misdiagnosis can occur if other conditions, such as bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, are mistaken for schizophrenia. It's important to consult a mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.

 I'm sorry to hear that you feel uncomfortable and hurt by your friend's reaction to the gift you sent her. It can be disheartening when we put effort into making someone else happy, only to have them respond with indifference or anger.

It's important to remember that everyone processes emotions differently, and it's possible that your friend may have had reasons for her behavior that are not immediately apparent. However, consistently disregarding other people's feelings is a pattern of behavior that can be hurtful and damaging to relationships.

You have the right to prioritize your own emotional well-being and decide whether or not you want to continue this friendship. If you choose to end the relationship, it may be helpful to acknowledge the experience as an opportunity for growth and learning about healthy boundaries in friendships.

As for why your friend behaved this way, it's impossible to say for certain without more information. It could be that she was going through a difficult time or felt overwhelmed, causing her to react impulsively and insensitively. Alternatively, her behavior may reflect deeper issues with empathy or emotional intelligence. Ultimately, it's important to focus on your own feelings and needs rather than trying to understand or change someone else's behavior.

It's understandable how this fear has been impacting your daily life and limiting your ability to engage in certain activities. Based on your description, it seems like you may be experiencing a type of anxiety disorder known as "paruresis" or "shy bladder syndrome."

 I understand how frustrating and disappointing it can be when you misremember a scheduled appointment and arrive late, especially when it's with someone like a counselor who you trust and value their guidance.

 While having a strong ego foundation is crucial for emotional stability, it doesn't necessarily mean that one can thrive without any external support or encouragement.

Therefore, it's essential to strike a balance between self-reliance and seeking social support when needed.

 I understand that feeling tired from constant sharing and messaging can be overwhelming. It's important to set healthy boundaries in relationships. You could try expressing your feelings to your friends in a kind and respectful manner, letting them know that while you appreciate their thoughtfulness, you would like more space for personal time and privacy. Suggest alternative ways of connecting that don't involve constant sharing or messaging, such as meeting up in person or engaging in shared activities. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being.

 Intimate relationships can be challenging for individuals with Asperger's and autism due to social communication difficulties. However, with support and effort, it is possible to build meaningful connections. Here are some suggestions:

It's natural to feel hurt when we are labeled as immature, especially when we believe we are capable of living independently. Your plans to move out and live on your own demonstrate your courage and determination for personal growth.

When it comes to convincing your mother, it may be helpful to approach the conversation with empathy and openness. Share how you have been reflecting on your relationship with her and the importance of taking this step towards independence. Listen actively to her concerns and address them in a respectful and understanding manner. You might also consider involving other family members or seeking support from a trusted friend or therapist during this conversation. Remember, it's okay if not everyone is immediately supportive; the most important thing is that you stay true to your goals and continue moving forward in a positive direction.

 I'm sorry to hear that you've experienced a lack of encouragement and praise from your mother throughout your life. It can be incredibly challenging and emotionally draining to feel unheard and undervalued by someone so close to us. It's understandable that you've chosen to keep some distance from her in order to protect yourself from the negative impact of her words. Remember, you are not powerless in this situation. While you cannot change your mother, you can control how you respond to her and set boundaries to prioritize your emotional well-being. It's important to acknowledge the pain you've experienced and allow yourself to grieve the missed opportunities for positive relationships with your mom. Seeking support from trusted friends or a therapist can also help you process these feelings and find ways to heal.

 I can imagine how distressing and confusing it must be for you to experience moments of forgetting the faces and identities of people close to you, such as your mother or boyfriend. These episodes may be disconcerting, especially during intimate moments. It is important to remember that everyone's experiences are unique, and there could be various reasons behind these occurrences. However, if these incidents are causing significant distress or impacting your daily life, it might be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional or a therapist for further evaluation and support.

 I can understand how difficult it is to feel torn between your ideals and reality. It's normal to set high goals for ourselves, but it can be frustrating when we don't have the strength or motivation to achieve them. Please remember that it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. Instead of focusing on an ideal self, try to focus on small steps you can take towards growth and self-discovery. It's important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes and experiences setbacks. You are not defined by your past decisions or failures. Instead, use them as opportunities to learn and grow. If you need help navigating these feelings, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support.

 It can be challenging and disappointing when we expect a response but don't receive one. This experience is common and can lead to feelings of anxiety or loneliness. In your case, it seems that you have a strong desire to connect with others and respond promptly yourself.

One suggestion could be to practice setting healthy boundaries around your communication needs. For example, you might consider designating specific times for checking messages or engaging in group chats, rather than constantly monitoring them throughout the day and night. Additionally, it may be helpful to engage in other activities that bring you joy and fulfillment when you're not able to connect with others online. Remember, everyone has unique communication styles and schedules, so try to approach this situation with compassion for yourself and others.
*
 I understand that trust is an essential component of the therapeutic relationship, and it's natural for you to question your feelings towards your counselor. Trust is not solely based on factors like training or appearance but rather on how your counselor responds to you, respects your boundaries, and creates a safe and non-judgmental space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. If you feel that you are unable to be open and honest with your counselor, it may be worth considering discussing your concerns with them directly. They may be able to provide reassurance or adjust their approach to better meet your needs. Ultimately, trust is a complex emotion that develops over time through consistent positive experiences in therapy. If you continue to feel uncertain, it might be helpful to consider seeking a second opinion from another counselor to determine if the issue lies with your current therapist or if it's something more profound.

 I'm sorry to hear about the complex dynamics in your friendship. It's important to recognize that both of you are dealing with challenging emotions and experiences.

Given these circumstances, it may be helpful for both of you to seek professional support. A therapist could provide guidance on healthy communication strategies and help each of you work through your individual emotional needs. If therapy is not an option, consider setting clear boundaries that respect both yours and your friend's feelings. Be open about expressing your discomfort while also acknowledging the importance of her emotional well-being. Ultimately, it may be necessary to reevaluate the nature of your friendship if the demands placed on you become too burdensome or detrimental to your mental health. Remember that prioritizing self-care and setting healthy boundaries are essential for maintaining any relationship, including friendships.

It sounds like growing up in your household involved a great deal of pressure around keeping the house clean and maintaining certain expectations that felt difficult for you to meet. Your mother's criticism and intense emotional reactions can be overwhelming and cause fear.

 I understand that you have had lifelong fears related to the dark, ghosts, monsters, and animals, particularly dogs. These fears have persisted into your college years and can significantly impact your daily life. It's normal to experience some degree of fear or anxiety, but if these feelings are causing distress and interfering with your ability to function, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional.

A therapist can help you explore the origins of these fears and provide coping strategies to manage them. Remember, it's okay to seek help and support when needed.
*
 I understand that growing up in a family dynamic where the power lies with your mother's relatives can leave you feeling powerless and anxious about potential exploitation. These feelings are valid and it's important to acknowledge them. However, it's essential to remember that perceptions and reality may not always align. While it's understandable for subconscious thoughts to create negative fantasies, it's crucial to focus on the actual behaviors exhibited by your family members. Communication with your parents about your feelings can help clarify any misunderstandings or fears. Additionally, practicing mindfulness and self-care techniques may help alleviate anxiety and improve overall emotional wellbeing.
