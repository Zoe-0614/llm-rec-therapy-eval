 Schizophrenia is a complex condition believed to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. The manifestations include symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and disorganized behavior. While counseling can provide support and help manage certain symptoms, it's not typically the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Instead, antipsychotic medication is often used to manage psychosis and improve functioning. Recovery from schizophrenia varies greatly – some people may make a full recovery, while others may continue to experience symptoms. The length of treatment and recovery depends on individual circumstances. Misdiagnosis is possible, but modern diagnostic tools are quite accurate when used by experienced professionals. Your efforts in seeking help are commendable, and I'm confident that with the right care and support, progress can be made towards improved mental health.

 While it's true that social connections and support can enrich our lives, a stable ego does not necessarily require constant external validation or encouragement to function effectively. The ego is an internal construct that represents our sense of identity and self-worth. It's important to acknowledge the patient's efforts and progress in developing a strong, positive self-image. With continued practice of self-care, mindfulness, and resilience, individuals can maintain their ego structure even in the absence of external support.

Embracing both independence and interdependence is a key aspect of mental health and personal growth.

Consider setting aside specific times during the day to respond to messages or suggest using a "do not disturb" feature on your phone to limit interruptions. You could also communicate with your friends about setting boundaries, such as asking them to only share important news or invitations. This way, you can maintain positive relationships while also preserving your energy and focus on personal plans.

Remember, it's essential to prioritize self-care and establish healthy communication patterns that work best for you. Keep up the good work in balancing your social obligations with personal needs!
